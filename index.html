<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Traveling Man: The Journey of Ibn Battuta 1325-1354</h2><p>James Rumford, himself a world traveler, has retold Ibn Battuta&#x2019;s story in words and pictures, adding the element of ancient Arab maps&#x2014;maps as colorful and evocative as a Persian miniature, as intricate and mysterious as a tiled Moroccan wall. Into this arabesque of pictures and maps is woven the story not just of a traveler in a world long gone but of a man on his journey through life.</p><p>Master storyteller James Rumford combines his love for art and history in his picture books. Each of his books is vastly different in its content, design, and illustrations but one aspect remains constant throughout his work: his passion about his subjects. Rumford, a resident of Hawaii, has studied more than a dozen languages and worked in the Peace Corps, where he traveled to Africa, Asia, and Afghanistan. He draws from these experiences and the history of his subject when he is working on a book. His book Sequoyah: The Cherokee Man Who Gave His People Writing was a 2005 Sibert Honor winner.Gr 3-6-"In the days when the earth was flat and Jerusalem was the center of the world, there was a boy named Ibn Battuta." So begins this introduction to the journeys of this historically important but probably little-known, 14th-century Muslim figure. Born in Morocco and raised as a scholar, he began his 29 years of travel in 1325 when, "At twenty-one, he decided to go to Mecca as a pilgrim." He went on through Africa, across the steppes of Asia, into India and China, and back to Morocco where "he told his story to the Moroccan court secretary Ibn Juzayy, who wrote it down in Arabic." Rumford's simply written adaptation is often surprisingly eloquent. For example, Ibn Battuta comments on his voyage: "Traveling-it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller." "Traveling-it had captured my heart, and now my heart was calling me home." On each page, a portion of the text appears within its own bright white narrow road crossing elegantly bordered illustrations that shine with generous amounts of gold, red, and deep blue. This text also flows into and out of larger frames. The artist adorns many of these illustrations with Arabic and Chinese calligraphy, providing translations for the longer phrases at the end of the book. A few maps are included and they are executed with the same attention to presentation. A glossary of names, places, and important words provides essential information in an accessible format. Simply put, this is a beautifully crafted work that will undoubtedly spark interest and encourage further study.<p></p><p><i>Alicia Eames, New York City Public Schools</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How Big Pharma Has Corrupted Healthcare</h2><p>PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AFTER HEART DISEASE AND CANCER. In his latest ground-breaking book, Peter C Gotzsche exposes the pharmaceutical industries and their charade of fraudulent behaviour, both in research and marketing where the morally repugnant disregard for human lives is the norm. He convincingly draws close comparisons with the tobacco conglomerates, revealing the extraordinary truth behind efforts to confuse and distract the public and their politicians. The book addresses, in evidence-based detail, an extraordinary system failure caused by widespread crime, corruption, bribery and impotent drug regulation in need of radical reforms. &#34;The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don&#39;t sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so different from anything else in life...Virtually everything we know about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our doctors...the reason patients trust their medicine is that they extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they prescribe. The patients don&#39;t realise that, although their doctors may know a lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very little about drugs that hasn&#39;t been carefully concocted and dressed up by the drug industry...If you don&#39;t think the system is out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of death...If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new bacterium or a virus, or even one-hundredth of it, we would have done everything we could to get it under control.&#34; FROM THE INTRODUCTION</p><p>Professor Peter C G�tzsche graduated as a Master of Science in biology and chemistry in 1974 and as a physician in 1984.

A domestic upset in the kitchen had to be smoothed over before she even arrived at the school to find the unreliable typewriter there refused to work. The decision to retrieve her own little typewriter from the home of Sir Oswald Newbold, had been where it all began.</p><p>As the pony trap turned off Bukit Timah Road into the long drive that wound its way through the abandoned rubber trees and thickets of jungle up to Sir Oswald Newbold&#x2019;s home, the hairs on the back of her neck began to prickle.</p><p>Not a monkey, a bird or an insect could be heard in the <i>ulu</i> that surrounded the house and a cloying hush settled around Harriet, as thick and impenetrable as the humidity of the late morning.</p><p>The pony flattened his ears and slowed his jaunty pace, as the low silhouette of the old plantation house came into view. Aziz clucked his tongue encouragingly but Mr. Carrots came to a standstill, his ears pressed against his lowered head. The boy shifted in his seat, his gaze darting around the overgrown garden.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Mem. We go no further and I think we should not stay. They call this place Bukit Hantu It is a bad place.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;Bukit Hantu? What does that mean?&#x201d; Harriet asked.</p><p>Her client had told her that he had named the property <i>Mandalay</i>, in memory of his long connection with Burma.</p><p>Aziz shook his head. &#x201c;There are evil spirits here.&#x201d;</p><p>Harriet smiled at the boy &#x201c;There are no such thing as evil spirits, Aziz. You stay here with Carrots and I'll just pop in and collect the typewriter.&#x201d;</p><p>Aziz jumped from the trap and helped Harriet down.&nbsp;</p><p>She narrowly avoided a puddle, remnant of the morning rain storms. Lifting her skirts to avoid the cloying red mud, she strode the last fifty yards to the steps of the old house. On her first visit to Mandalay, it had not seemed quite so run down but now she could see the wood on the verandah supports were rotten and in need of painting, green mildew stained the stone steps and a single shutter somewhere around the side of the house flapped and banged, even though there seemed to be no wind.</p><p>And again, the silence... no sound of servants chattering, no clanging of pots from the kitchen. Nothing.</p><p>Her unease intensified as she set her foot on the lower step leading up the verandah.</p><p>Glancing back, she forced a smile and waved at Aziz. The boy stood in the shade of a massive Rain tree, holding Mr. Carrots bridle. As she watched the pony shook his head, almost sending the slender boy flying. The animal started to back away and it took all Aziz's strength to hold him. Neither boy nor animal wanted to be here and her unease began to grow.</p><p><i>Bukit Hantu</i>? Harriet's knowledge of Malay was still rudimentary. She knew bukit meant hill, but hantu? She would ask Julian when she got home.</p><p>The wooden boards on the verandah creaked as she approached the door. Her client would not be expecting her until later in the day, but she needed the typewriter she had left with him. She knocked loudly on the frosted glass panel and stood back, expecting Sir Oswald's elderly Burmese servant to answer the door as he had done the previous day. The seconds ticked past without any movement from within the house.</p><p>She tried the door handle and found the door unlocked. Given the valuables she had seen in the house, she considered Sir Oswald's security a little lax.</p><p>'Hello,' she called, her voice vanishing into the dark bowels of the house. 'Sir Oswald? Are you at home?'</p><p><i>Damn it,</i> she swore under her breath. She needed the typewriter.&nbsp;</p><p>If no one was at home perhaps she could retrieve her property and be gone, leaving a note of apology for her intrusion.</p><p>Remembering the name of Sir Oswald's servant, she called out again.</p><p>'Nyan? Sir Oswald?'</p><p>Only an echoing silence reverberated through the house to the open back door visible from where she stood.</p><p><i>Just collect the typewriter and go</i>. <i>You can leave a note...</i></p><p>She stepped over the threshold and as her eyes adjusted to the gloom, she caught her breath. The main living room bore no resemblance to the cluttered room she had admired the day before. Then every space had been filled with oriental rugs, antique furniture and Asian art. This morning nothing remained in place. Furniture had been overturned, cushions torn apart and valuable porcelain lay shattered on the rugs.</p><p>A sensible woman would have turned on her heel.</p><p>She glanced at the study door. It stood ajar and drawn by an invisible force, she approached it, her breath held tightly in her throat. Something under her foot crunched and she started, taking a step back. The splintered remains of two port glasses lay scattered across the floor, along with a small silver tray and a broken decanter. Her nose twitched as she caught the scent of the port and something else, sweet and sickly, at odds with the pervading odor of damp and dust.</p><p>She skirted the broken port glasses and put her hand out to push the door open, but drew it back as if she had been bitten at the sight of dark smears on the chipped white paint.</p><p>With a single extended finger, she pushed the study door. It opened on protesting hinges and she peered around it, her gaze seeking the familiar solidity of the sturdy black case of the Corona typewriter. It sat where she had left it, on the round table in the center of the room but as her peripheral vision widened she let out her breath in a gasp.</p><p>Every book had been swept from the shelves, papers scattered across the floor interspersed with copious amounts of broken china and in the middle of the carnage, between the table and the big desk, Sir Oswald Newbold lay spreadeagled.</p><p>Years of assisting her husband's medical practice and his work in the worst slums of India had enured her to death in its many forms but nothing could have prepared her for the sight of the bloodstained corpse lying on the expensive oriental carpet. He stared up at the ceiling with sightless eyes, his face fixed in a grimace of horror, echoed only by the hideous grin of the devilish imp carved on the handle of the antique knife, the dha Sir Oswald had called it when he had shown it to her the previous day, that had been thrust into his neck.</p><p>The scream stuck in Harriet's throat.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Runnels of sweat trickled down the back of Inspector Robert Curran&#x2019;s neck, softening the stiff, starched collar of his uniform. He took off his helmet and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief, before turning his attention to the old colonial plantation house. Time and the elements had not been kind to the once proud structure that bore a crudely painted sign above the steps leading up to the veranda. &#x201c;<i>Mandalay</i>&#x2019;. A name that conjured up the romance and mystique of Burma, not this neglected building.</p><p>Dark green moss stretched over the weathered timber like the grasping fingers of the jungle eager to reclaim the building back into the forest. Several windows were missing shutters and on others they swung crookedly on rusty hinges.&nbsp; Even from where he stood he could see the verandah floor had warped from the constant humidity.</p><p>A pony trap, guarded by a young Malay boy stood in the shade of a Rain tree some distance from the house. Avoiding a large puddle in the rutted driveway, remnant of the morning rain storms, Curran approached the boy. The lad bobbed his head, his hand stroking the nose of the skewbald pony, whose ears twitched unhappily as a large drop of moisture landed squarely on the white patch between his eyes.</p><p>In his fluent Malay, Curran asked the boy his name.</p><p>&#x201c;Aziz, tuan,&#x201d; the boy replied. His gaze darted to the verandah. &#x201c;I told the mem this was a bad place. Bukit Hantu is a place of bad spirits. Can I take the mem and go home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not just yet.&#x201d; Curran gave the boy a reassuring smile. &#x201c;I need to speak to the mem. You just wait here.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned toward the house, pacing the distance in easy strides. What had the boy called the place? <i>Bukit Hantu</i>? The haunted hill.</p><p>He made a mental note to ask one of the Malay constables how the place had acquired that name. The name on his notes just said &#x2018;Newbold - Mandalay&#x2019;.</p><p>He approached the steps leading up to the verandah. Beyond the wide expanse of warped and broken boards, the front door stood open but the bulk of his sergeant, Gursharan Singh, loomed out of the gloom obscuring any view into the house.</p><p>&#x201c;Who found the body?&#x201d; he asked Singh.</p><p>&#x201c;She did, sir.&#x201d; His sergeant indicated a European woman who sat bolt upright in a rattan arm chair on the verandah, her hands clutching a leather handbag. A fall of pink Bougainvillea that climbed across the verandah and threatened to engulf the house had hidden her from sight.</p><p>The woman looked up at him from beneath a sensible pith helmet swathed in a net and he had an impression of a youngish woman, with brown hair, coiled, as was the fashion at the nape of her neck. She wore a plain white, high necked blouse fastened with a brooch at her throat and a skirt of an indeterminate dark color. A thoroughly respectable woman who seemed at odds with the decayed house.</p><p>Beneath a complexion far too unfashionably browned to have ever graced his aunt&#x2019;s drawing room, she looked grey, and drawn. Although he was yet to view the corpse, Curran knew it would be no sight for the faint hearted. It surprised him the woman had not succumbed to the vapors. Instead she sat waiting for him, pale but perfectly composed.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gordon. Mrs. Harriet Gordon,&#x201d; Singh said. He leaned toward his superior officer. Curran topped six feet, but Singh had several inches on him.</p><p>&#x201c;You should know, sir. There&#x2019;s not just one body. We found a servant dead in the kitchen.&#x201d;</p><p>Curran&#x2019;s lips tightened and he issued curt orders to Singh before crossing the verandah to address Mrs. Gordon.</p><p>&#x201c;Inspector Curran, Detective Branch,&#x201d; he said, holding out his hand. &#x201c;You are Mrs. Gordon?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman rose to her feet to shake his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Gordon. I am the sister of the headmaster of St. Thomas School.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What brought you out here today, Mrs. Gordon?&#x201d;</p><p>She raised her chin, her shoulders straightening. &#x201c;I did some secretarial work for Sir Oswald yesterday and I came to retrieve my typewriter.&#x201d; Beneath the tight white collar of her blouse, her throat worked as she swallowed, and she pushed a damp tendril of brown hair back behind her ear with a trembling hand. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t suppose I could have it back? I need it for work at the school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps later. Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Gordon&#x2019;s face had taken on an unhealthy sheen and she swayed slightly. Curran wondered if shock had begun to set in. With two corpses on his hands, he did not need a fainting woman. He gestured at the chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Please take a seat, Mrs. Gordon. Is there anything I can get you?&#x201d;</p><p>A tremulous smile caught the corner of her lips. &#x201c;A cup of tea would be nice, but failing that, a glass of water?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see what we can do,&#x201d; Curran strode across to the verandah rail and gestured to his driver, Constable Tan.</p><p>&#x201c;Tan, fetch some water for Mrs. Gordon.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Gordon subsided on to the chair, running a hand over her eyes. He studied her anxiously for signs of imminent vapors, but whatever momentary weakness had afflicted her, had passed and she met his gaze with surprisingly cold, hard eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I would like to return home, Inspector.&#x201d;</p><p>His instincts prickled at the obvious animosity in that gaze.</p><p>&#x201c;How well were you acquainted with Sir Oswald?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at all. I met him for the first time on Saturday and at his request came out here yesterday afternoon to do some work for him.&#x201d;</p><p>Curran leaned against the verandah rail, crossing his booted feet at the ankles. &#x201c;He was not expecting you today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. We had agreed that I would return on Wednesday afternoon to continue my commission.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was typing his memoirs, Inspector.&#x201d;</p><p>Curran cleared his throat. &#x201c;I apologize for the questions, but can you tell me exactly what you did when you arrived at the house today?&#x201d;</p><p>Her lips tightened and she looked down at her hands, her fingers teasing a leather tassel on her handbag. &#x201c;The front door was ajar. I knocked and called out but nobody answered. I called out again and concluded that no was at home.&#x201d;</p><p>Curran gave her a skeptical glance. &#x201c;So, you turned your hand to a little breaking and entering, Mrs. Gordon?&#x201d;</p><p>Her head came up, her eyes blazing. &#x201c;I... I didn&#x2019;t see it that way. I intended merely to retrieve my typewriter, leaving a note for Sir Oswald.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You will see for yourself, the living room has been pulled apart. At the door to the study I trod on some broken glass and that was when I saw the marks on the closed door.&#x201d; She swallowed. &#x201c;It is blood?&#x201d;</p><p>Curran shook his head. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been inside yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Her shoulders lifted and she blew out a breath. &#x201c;I thought... no... I knew something was terribly wrong. I pushed the door open and went in.&#x201d;</p><p>Curran wondered how many other women of his acquaintance would have had the courage to open that door.</p><p>&#x201c;And what did you see?&#x201d; he prompted.</p><p>&#x201c;My typewriter was where I had left it but like the living room there was a terrible mess and of course, Sir Oswald...&#x201d; she trailed off and took a shuddering breath before looking up at him.&nbsp; &#x201c;I assure you, apart from the telephone, I have touched nothing in the roo...</p></p><h2>Nobody Walks (Soho Crime)</h2><p><b>Set in the same fictional London as his CWA Gold Dagger Award-winning Slough House spy series, Mick Herron now introduces Tom Bettany, a man with a violent past and only one thing to live for: Avenging his son&#x2019;s death.</b><br><br> Tom Bettany is working at a meat processing plant in France when he gets a voicemail from an Englishwoman he doesn&#x2019;t know telling him that his estranged 26-year-old son is dead&#x2014;Liam Bettany fell from his London balcony, where he was smoking pot.<br><br>Now for the first time since he cut all ties years ago, Bettany returns home to London&nbsp;to find out the truth about his son&#x2019;s death. Maybe it&#x2019;s the guilt he feels about losing touch with Liam that&#x2019;s gnawing at him, or maybe he&#x2019;s actually put his finger on a labyrinthine plot, but either way he&#x2019;ll get to the bottom of the tragedy, no matter whose feathers he has to ruffle. But more than a few people are interested to hear Bettany is back in town, from incarcerated mob bosses to those in the highest echelons of MI5.

And there it lingered like a moth in a box, weightless, and aching for the light.<br>&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br>The street cleaners&#x2019; lorry woke Bettany. It was 4:25 am. He washed at the sink, dressed, turned the bed&#x2019;s thin mattress, and rolled his sleeping bag into a tight package he leaned upright in a corner. 4:32.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locking the door was an act of faith or satire&#x2014;the lock would barely withstand a rattle&#x2014;but the room wouldn&#x2019;t be empty long, because someone else used it during the day. Bettany hadn&#x2019;t met him, but they&#x2019;d reached an accommodation. The daytime occupant respected Bettany&#x2019;s possessions&#x2014;his toothbrush, his sleeping bag, the dog-eared copy of <i>Dubliners</i> he&#x2019;d found on a bus&#x2014;and in return Bettany left untouched the clothing that hung from a hook on the door, three shirts and a pair of khakis.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His own spare clothing he kept in a duffel bag in a locker at the sheds. Passport and wallet he carried in a security belt with his mobile, until that got lost or stolen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside was February cold, quiet enough that he could hear water rinsing the sewers. A bus grumbled past, windows fogged. Bettany nodded to the whore on the corner, whose territory was bounded by two streetlights. She was Senegalese, pre-op, currently a redhead, and he&#x2019;d bought her a drink one night, God knew why. They had exile in common, but little else. Bettany&#x2019;s French remained undistinguished, and the hooker&#x2019;s English didn&#x2019;t lend itself to small talk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A taste of the sea hung in the air. This would burn off later, and be replaced by urban flavours.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He caught the next bus, a twenty-minute ride to the top of a lane which fell from the main road like an afterthought, and as he trudged downhill a truck passed, horn blaring, its headlights yellowing the sheds ahead, which were barn-sized constructions behind wire-topped fences. A wooden sign hung lopsided from the gates, one of its tethering chains longer than the other. The words were faded by weather. Bettany had never been able to make them out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audible now, the sound of cattle in distress.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was waved through and fetched his apron from the locker room. A group of men were smoking by the door, and one grunted his name.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tonton.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they called him, for reasons lost in the mist of months.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knotted his apron, which was stained so thick with blood and grease it felt plastic, and fumbled his gloves on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out in the yard the truck was impatient, its exhaust fumes spoiling out in thick black ropes. The noise from the nearest shed was mechanical, mostly, and its smells metallic and full of fear. Behind Bettany men stamped their cigarettes out and hawked noisily. Refrigerated air whispered from the truck&#x2019;s dropped tailgate.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany&#x2019;s role wasn&#x2019;t complicated. Lorries arrived bearing cattle and the cattle were fed into the sheds. What came out was meat, which was then ferried away in different lorries. Bettany&#x2019;s job, and that of his companions, was to carry the meat to the lorries. This not only required no thought, it demanded thought&#x2019;s absence. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At day&#x2019;s end he&#x2019;d hose down the yard, a task he performed with grim diligence, meticulously blasting every scrap of matter down the drains.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He switched off, and the working day took over. This was measured in a familiar series of aches and smells and sounds, the same actions repeated with minor variations, while blurred memories nagged him uninvited, moments which had seemed unexceptional at the time, but had persisted. A woman in a caf�, regarding him with what might have been interest, might have been contempt. An evening at the track with Majeed, who was the nearest he&#x2019;d made to a friend, though he hadn&#x2019;t made enemies. He didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d made enemies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts became rituals in themselves. You plodded the same course over and over, like any dumb beast or wind-up toy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about the time citizens would be leaving their homes in clean shirts Bettany stopped for coffee, pitch black in a polystyrene cup. He ate a hunk of bread wrapped round cheese, leaning against the fence and watching grey weather arrive, heading inland. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From three metres&#x2019; distance Majeed detached himself from a group similarly occupied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hey, Tonton. You lose your mobile?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It spun through the air. He caught it one-handed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Ou?</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>La Girondelle</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bar at the track. He was surprised to see it again, though the reason why wasn&#x2019;t long in coming.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>C&#x2019;est de la merde</i>. Not worth stealing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany gave no argument.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The piece of shit, not worth stealing, was barely worth ringing either, though still had a flicker of charge. Four missed calls in nine days. Two were local numbers and hadn&#x2019;t left messages. The others were from England, unfamiliar streams of digits. Odds were they were cold calls, checking out his inclinations vis-�-vis internet banking or double-glazing. He finished his coffee undecided whether to listen or delete, then found his thumb resolving the issue of its own accord, scrolling to his voicemail number, pressing play.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, this is Detective Sergeant Welles, speaking from Hoxton police station. Er, London. I&#x2019;m trying to reach a Mr. Thomas Bettany? If you could give me a ring at your earliest convenience. It&#x2019;s a matter of some importance.&#x201d; He recited a number slowly enough that Bettany caught it first time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mouth was dry. The bread, the cheese, grew lumpy in his stomach.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second voice was less measured.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mr. Bettany? Liam&#x2019;s father?&#x201d; It was a girl, or young woman. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Flea, Felicity Pointer? I&#x2019;m calling about Liam . . . Mr. Bettany, I&#x2019;m so sorry to have to tell you this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sounded sorry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been an accident. Liam&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Bettany. Liam died.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either she paused a long while or the recorded silence dragged itself out in slow motion, eating up his pre-paid minutes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Message ends. To hear the message envelope, press One. To save the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He killed the robot voice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearby, Majeed was halfway through a story, dropping into English when French wasn&#x2019;t obscene enough. Bettany could hear the creaking of a trolley&#x2019;s metal wheels, a chain scraping over a beam. Another lorry trundled down the lane, its grille broad, an American model. Already details were stacking up. More blurred snapshots he&#x2019;d flick through in future days, always associated with the news just heard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached for the back of his neck, and untied his apron.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tonton?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dropped it to the ground.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Ou vas-tu?</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany fetched his duffel from the locker.<br> <b><br><br> </b> <b>1.2</b><br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;The crematorium was single-storey, stucco-clad, with a high chimney. On one side creeping plants swarmed a cane trellis that bordered an array of small gardens divided by hedges. Japanese stones neighboured ornamental ponds and bonsaid trees peered from terracotta pots. Other patches echoed formal English styles, orchards, terraced rosebeds, in any of which you might strew the ashes of the departed, supposing the deceased had expressed a preference.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany imagined Liam saying <i>When I&#x2019;m dead, scatter me on a Japanese garden. Not in actual Japan. Just anywhere handy</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mild English winter was turning chill, but all that remained of the morning&#x2019;s frost was a damp smudge on the pavements. The imprints of vanished leaves were stamped there too, like the work of a graffiti artist who&#x2019;d run out of things to say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany&#x2019;s once-blond shaggy hair was now streaked grey, like his ragged beard, and while his eyes were strikingly blue, their expression was vague. His hands, large and raw, were jammed in the pockets of a cheap raincoat, and he rocked slightly on feet cased in work-boots that had seen better days. Under the coat he wore jeans, a long-sleeved crew-neck tee and a zippered top. These were the spare clothes from his duffel bag, but three days&#x2019; wear had taken their toll. The duffel itself he&#x2019;d abandoned in a bin, he couldn&#x2019;t remember which side of the Channel. For all the hours he&#x2019;d spent on buses, he&#x2019;d managed little sleep. His only conversation had been a brief exchange on the ferry, when a French trucker lent him the use of a phone charger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first stop on reaching London had been Hoxton Police Station.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detective Sergeant Welles, once located, had been sympathetic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for your loss.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany nodded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody seemed to know where you were. But there was an idea you were out of the country. I&#x2019;m glad you got back in time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was how he discovered the cremation was taking place that morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d sat in the back row. The chapel of remembrance was quarter-full, most of the congregation Liam&#x2019;s age, none of them known to him, but an introduction contained a familiar name, Felicity Pointer. Flea, she&#x2019;d called herself on the phone. She approached the lectern looking twenty-five, twenty-six, brunette and lightly olive-skinned, wearing black of course. Hardly looking at the assembled company, she read a short poem about chimney sweeps, then returned to her seat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching this, Bettany had barely paid attention to the main object of interest, but looking at it now he realised that what he&#x2019;d been feeling these past three days was not grief but numbness. A pair of curtains provided the backdrop, and behind them the coffin would soon pass, and there the remains of his only son would be reduced to ash and fragments of bone, to the mess of clinker you&#x2019;d find in a grate on a winter&#x2019;s morning. Nothing of substance. And all Bettany could make of it was an all-consuming absence of feeling, as if he was indeed the stranger his son had made of him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose and slipped out of the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting by the trellis, it struck him that it was seven years since he&#x2019;d been in London. He supposed he ought to be noticing differences, things being better or worse, but he couldn&#x2019;t see much had changed. The skyline had altered, with new towers jutting heavenwards from the City, and more poised to sprout everywhere you looked. But that had always been the case. London had never been finished, and never would be. Or not by dint of new construction.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven years since London, three of them in Lyme. Then Hannah had died, and he&#x2019;d left England. Now Liam had died, and he was back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welles had given him a lift here. There might have been a hidden agenda, pump the father for information, but Bettany had none to offer and the flow had gone the other way. How it had happened, for instance. Up through France, across the choppy Channel, Bettany hadn&#x2019;t known the how. Of the various possibilities some kind of traffic accident had seemed most likely, Liam driving too fast on a fog-bound stretch of motorway, or a bus mounting the pavement, Liam in the wrong place. He could have called and spared himself conjecture, but that would have been to make imagination fact. Now he learned that there had been no cars involved, no buses. Liam had fallen from the window of his flat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Were you in close contact with your son, Mr. Bettany?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So you wouldn&#x2019;t know much about his lifestyle?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know where he lived.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not far from here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which would make it N1.

Based on the Paracelsian concept of three essentials, Body, Soul and Spirit, Frater Albertus developed a system of teaching alchemical concepts using the spagyric technique of separation and cohobation. The unique gradated courses allowed students to explore aspects of the vegetable, mineral and animal kingdoms in an understandable and accessible way. Previous to this, one had to be a member of a fraternity or secret society in order to gain access to structured teaching. After his death in 1984, the college ceased operations in the United States but continued to carry on the tradition in Australia. Frater Albertus had a profound effect on the way Alchemy and particularly the Spagyric method was disseminated and understood in the mid to late 20th century.

And the Nazis never discovered their secret.&nbsp;<br><br>Before the war, The Netherlands had been a neutral country, welcoming many German Jewish refugees across the border, but on May 10 1940, after promising not to attack, Hitler's army swept furiously into Holland and overtook this beautiful land. The Dutch were stunned but consoled by promises that the persecution happening in Germany wouldn't occur in Holland. A special council--the&nbsp;Judenrat--was formed to meet the needs of Jewish residents, and they provided these Jewish citizens the best healthcare in the country at a camp called Westerbork.&nbsp;<br><br>Even as new regulations were implemented in Holland, many of the 140,000 Dutch Jews believed they were safe because the Nazis granted thousands of exemptions to their growing list of rules. Everything changed in July 1942 when the Nazis, assisted by the Judenrat, began rounding up Jewish citizens and cramming them into a gutted Amsterdam theater called Hollandsche Schouwburg. Residents waited there for days will little sustenance or fresh air before they were transported east.&nbsp;<br><br>Walter S�skind, the first of these three Dutch leaders, was a German Jewish salesman forced to oversee the registration and deportation of each man, woman, and child inside the theater. Across the street from the theater, separated by a tram line, were two brick-clad buildings that housed a daycare run by&nbsp;Henri�tte Pimentel,&nbsp;a matronly Jewish woman, and the Reformed Teachers' Training College with a young principal named&nbsp;Johan van Hulst.<br><br>The children housed at the theater were quite loud, annoying the German soldiers, so Walter befriended the commanding officer and suggested they transfer these kids to the daycare. After the officer concurred, Henri�tte readily agreed to host them, and Johan and some of his teaching students volunteered to help. But they all wanted to do more than just offer these children food and shelter before deportation. They wanted to save their lives.<br><br>The German records were quite meticulous and regulated, but Walter, Henri�tte, and Johan devised a seemingly impossible plan. With permission from the parents, away from the oversight of the Nazi officers, Walter began eliminating the names of children from the registry lists. Once he erased them, these children--in the eyes of the Nazis--ceased to exist.<br><br>Still the Nazis kept an eye on the daycare center so Johan and Henri�tte concocted a number of ways to steal these unregistered children away. When the tram divided the daycare from the watchful eye of soldiers, for example, students would smuggle the kids out in laundry baskets, burlap bags, and milk cans. Sometimes they would take a dozen children on a walk and return with eleven. Or a baby tucked away in its carriage would be replaced with a doll.<br><br><i>More than six hundred children were rescued from the Hollandsche&nbsp;Schouwburg.</i><br><br>A miracle.<br><br>Each child was escorted to a safe home by a resistance worker, saving their life,&nbsp;but two of the three leaders who orchestrated their rescue died during the war.<br><br>In 1943 Henri�tte was killed at Auschwitz after accompanying her staff and the remaining children in her care.<br><br>Walter was exempted from deportation, but his wife and daughter were not. He chose to leave on a train with them and many think he was killed in 1945 by fellow inmates at Auschwitz who thought he, a former employee of the hated Judenrat, was a traitor.<br><br>Johan van Hulst passed away last year at the age of 107. He knew that I was writing&nbsp;<i>Memories of Glass</i><i>,</i> and it's been a great honor for me to connect with those who love him.<br><br>Most of the Dutch who rescued children didn't think they were heroic, and Dr. van Hulst was no exception. In fact, he once said: "I actually only think about what I have not been able to do.&nbsp;To those few thousand children that I could not have saved." (<i>Het Parool</i>)<br><br>The six hundred that he helped rescue, I suspect, think of him often.<br><br><i>Memories of Glass&nbsp;</i>was written to reflect both the corruption and heroism in Holland during World War II. It is a tribute, I hope, to those who risked everything to save a Dutch child."Like colored shards in sunlight, Melanie Dobson once again shines her light of truth in this elegantly complex and gripping tale of the hidden terrors of the Netherlands during WWII. Memories of Glass is a remarkable story, and one that will linger in the hearts of readers long after the last page." (Kate Breslin, bestselling author of For Such a Time)<br><br>"Memories of Glass is a remarkable, multi-layered novel that weaves stories of friendship and faith in wartime Holland together with a modern-day orphanage in Africa. Memorable characters portray the complexity of human relationships and reveal the lasting consequences of our choices, whether cowardly or courageous, and the mysteries kept me turning pages...." (Lynn Austin, bestselling author of Legacy of Mercy)<br><br>"Breathtaking, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting, Memories of Glass shows the beauty of helping others, the ugliness of people helping only themselves, and the destructive power of secrets through the generations. Melanie Dobson's memorable characters and fine eye for detail bring the danger of the Netherlands under Nazi occupation to life. This novel will stay with you." (Sarah Sundin, award-winning, bestselling author of The Sky Above Us)<br><br>"Heart-wrenching history combines with gripping characters and Melanie Dobson's signature gorgeous writing to create a tale you won't be able to put down--and won't want to. Memories of Glass is an amazing, intricately woven story of finding light in the least likely of places." (Roseanna M. White, bestselling author of the Shadows Over England series)<br><br>"With WWII-era and present-day storylines equally enthralling and skillfully entwined, I couldn't stop turning the pages of Melanie Dobson's Memories of Glass. Drawn from history to highlight the Dutch resistance to Hitler's Nazi regime, the story is sweeping in its scope of setting, each vividly alive on the page, and its pace felt like a snowball rolling downhill, gaining in suspense as the life-and-death stakes mounted. Peopled with characters heroic, flawed, and unforgettable, Memories of Glass is sure to please longtime fans of Melanie Dobson's books as well as readers new to her novels."

Anytime winter/Lent rolled around, the only thing we could count on was the house-wide hostility that would mount as we spent several weeks avoiding sweets and desserts in all their overindulgent forms. The colder months, you might recall, make up Girl Scout cookie season. In a unique show of torture, rather than simply not placing an order with the Scouts, our family bought a bunch, tossed them into the freezer, and stored them until Easter--about two months later. This recipe is for all you lifetime gluten-free folks who have never been able to enjoy a winter of Girl Scout Thin Mints--and for all you weak-willed kids who can&#x2019;t help but break the Lenten period of atonement. Bless your hearts! <p></p> <b>Instructions</b><br> <b>1.</b> Preheat the oven to 325�F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. <p></p> <b>2.</b> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, arrowroot, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt.

It is readable and nuanced, a marvelous teaching resource." --<b>Carter Heyward</b>, author of <i>Keep Your Courage: A Radical Christian Feminist Speaks</i> and Professor Emerita of Theology, Episcopal Divinity School<br> <br>"Patrick Cheng's <i>Radical Love</i> is not only an excellent introduction to LGBT theology but an important contribution to the discipline of theology and the life of the church. It is a must read for anyone who cares about the health of the church and theology today." --<b>James H. Cone</b>, Charles A. Briggs Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology, Union Theological Seminary, New York, NY<br> <br>"Thoroughly Christian and thoroughly Queer, Cheng helps readers welcome a theology that leaves no one behind." --<b>Chris Glaser</b>, author of <i>As My Own Soul: The Blessing of Same-Gender Marriage</i> and <i>Coming Out as Sacrament</i><br> <br>"This book is a clear, accessible and exciting analysis of Queer Theology. Cheng perfectly captures both the challenge and the rootedness of Queer Theology." --<b>Elizabeth Stuart</b>, Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Winchester, UK&nbsp;<br> <br>"I would characterize Cheng's notion of 'radical love' as 'wild grace' with which mainstream theology has yet to wrestle. This is a good text for introducing queer theology to undergraduate and graduate students." --<b>Robert Shore-Goss</b>, Senior Pastor/Theologian, Metropolitan Community Church in the Valley, North Hollywood, CA<br> <br>"Radical Love - a love so extreme that it dissolves our existing boundaries! What concept could be more liberating for a culture like ours, where lives are crucified on rigid binaries like male vs. female, us vs. them, straight vs. queer? <i>Radical Love</i> is an excellent introduction for beginners and an excellent synthesis for more advanced readers." --<b>Virginia Ramey Mollenkott</b>, author of <i>Sensuous Spirituality</i> and <i>Omnigender</i>, among many other books<br> <br>"While queer theory could be highly theoretical and off-putting, Cheng's Radical Love summarizes the contributions of queer theology in the last fifty years in an accessible and readable way." --<b>Kwok Pui-lan</b>, William F. Cole Professor of Theology and Spirituality, Episcopal Divinity School<br> <br>"The struggle now is perhaps to get enough courses in theological colleges and seminaries in which we can use this wonderful book." --<b>Lisa Isherwood</b>, Professor and Director of Theological Partnerships, University of Winchester, UK<br> <br>"Cheng covers a lot of territory and does so with clarity and solid interaction with the literature in the field. I would recommend this volume to anyone wanting a quick take on the various dimensions of Queer Theology." --<b>Jeffrey S. Siker</b>, Professor and Chair, Department of Theological Studies, Loyola Marymount University</p><p>Contextual theologies have developed from a number of perspectives - including feminist theology, black theology, womanist theology, Latin American liberation theology, and Asian American theology - and a wide variety of academic and general introductions exist to examine each one. However, Radical Love is the first introductory textbook on the subject of queer theology.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this lucid and compelling introduction, Cheng provides a historical survey of how queer theology has developed from the 1950s to today and then explicates the themes of queer theology using the ecumenical creeds as a general framework. Topics include revelation, God, Trinity, creation, Jesus Christ, atonement, sin, grace, Holy Spirit, church, sacraments, and last things, as seen through the lenses of LGBT theologians.<br>Patrick S.

To gain the hand of his beloved, Tristran rashly vows to fetch the fallen star and embarks upon a lover's quest that will carry him over the ancient wall and into a world beyond his wildest imagingings...<br><br>NEIL GAIMAN AND CHARLES VESS'S STARDUST features the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author (THE SANDMAN) and one of the industry's best illustrators at the height of their creative powers.</p><p><i>Stardust</i> is an utterly charming fairy tale in the tradition of <i>The Princess Bride</i> and <i>The Neverending Story</i>. Neil Gaiman, creator of the darkly elegant Sandman comics and author of <i>The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish</i>, tells the story of young Tristran Thorn and his adventures in the land of Faerie. One fateful night, Tristran promises his beloved that he will retrieve a fallen star for her from beyond the Wall that stands between their rural English town (called, appropriately, Wall) and the Faerie realm. No one ever ventures beyond the Wall except to attend an enchanted flea market that is held every nine years (and during which, unbeknownst to him, Tristran was conceived). But Tristran bravely sets out to fetch the fallen star and thus win the hand of his love. His adventures in the magical land will keep you turning pages as fast as you can--he and the star escape evil old witches, deadly clutching trees, goblin press-gangs, and the scheming sons of the dead Lord of Stormhold. The story is by turns thrillingly scary and very funny. You'll love goofy, earnest Tristran and the talking animals, gnomes, magic trees, and other irresistible denizens of Faerie that he encounters in his travels. <i>Stardust</i> is a perfect read-aloud book, a brand-new fairy tale you'll want to share with a kid, or maybe hoard for yourself.

Adam Petrazelli, 16 years old, is a subject of the clinical trial for ToZaPrex. He is reluctant to engage during therapy sessions. Nonverbal communication only. Not uncommon, given his reluctance to participate in therapy aspect of the drug trial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>August 15, 2012</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My first doctor said it was unusual for the symptoms to manifest in someone so young. Schizophrenic males are more commonly diagnosed in their early to late twenties. I remember thinking, Well, shit, that&#x2019;s awesome. I&#x2019;m unusual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m probably not supposed to swear in these entries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But you did say to treat them as confidential and that they would never be used against me, so I don&#x2019;t see any reason why I shouldn&#x2019;t use whatever language I&#x2019;m comfortable with. I&#x2019;m also not going to worry about ending sentences with a preposition. Or starting sentences with a conjunction. If this is, as you put it, &#x201c;a safe space for me to express myself,&#x201d; then I&#x2019;m going to write what I&#x2019;m thinking exactly as I&#x2019;m thinking it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll answer your questions, but I won&#x2019;t do it during our sessions. I&#x2019;ll do it here, on paper, where I can look at what I write before I hand it over to you. So I can edit what you see, and avoid saying anything that might get me kicked out of the drug trial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t always say the things I mean to say when I talk to someone. It&#x2019;s impossible to swallow words after letting them out, so it&#x2019;s better for me not to speak at all if I can help it. You&#x2019;ll just have to deal with that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I get that you have questions about my illness. Once people find out, it&#x2019;s all they can talk about. You probably know that it&#x2019;s the reason my mom and stepdad picked you. Because you have experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fair enough. I&#x2019;ve got to say you handled it pretty well. There were maybe two minutes of silence before you handed me a notepad and told me to write about our sessions afterward if I didn&#x2019;t want to talk, which I don&#x2019;t. And it&#x2019;s not because I don&#x2019;t want to get better--it&#x2019;s because I don&#x2019;t want to be here. More specifically, I don&#x2019;t want this to be real. I&#x2019;d like to treat therapy the way I treat everything else I&#x2019;d like to ignore. Like it doesn&#x2019;t exist. Because I already know that being here isn&#x2019;t going to fix anything. The drug might, though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You asked me when I first noticed that something was not quite normal. A change of some kind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the beginning I thought it was my glasses. No, not glasses. Spectacles. I like that word better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I got them when I turned twelve because I couldn&#x2019;t stop squinting and it drove my mom nuts. Dr. Leung is the one doctor I actually like, because he fixed a problem by giving me something fairly simple. Spectacles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Problem solved. I could see and my mom was happy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But that was also when I realized I was seeing things other people couldn&#x2019;t see. I was the only one jerking my head or squinting my eyes to get a better look. Everyone else was looking at me, not the birds that flew through the open window or the strange people who just sort of appeared in the living room. So I stopped wearing my spectacles and told my mom I&#x2019;d lost them. For a while that worked and I could pretend, but eventually, she bought so many pairs there was no excuse. I was screwed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t tell her I was seeing things for a long time. She&#x2019;d just married my stepdad and they were happy. When I did finally tell her, it was because I didn&#x2019;t have a choice. The principal called, and when Mom hung up the phone, she looked at me as if she were seeing me for the first time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Brizeno said you looked up in the chemistry lab, started screaming, and fell to the floor.&#x201d; I remember how calm she was. My mom has this Jedi voice that sort of washes over you when she&#x2019;s trying to get information. &#x201c;What did you see?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t answer her right away. I took off my spectacles and tried to pretend she wasn&#x2019;t there, that she had faded out of the room after asking the question. I&#x2019;m good at making myself believe these things, but it was harder this time. She just stood there, waiting for an answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bats,&#x201d; I said, looking down at my shoes. &#x201c;Huge black bats.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t tell her that they were twice the size of regular bats or that they had human eyes or that their tiny fangs hung like needles from their mouths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When she started crying, I wished the bats had been real. That the creepy little bastards had eaten me in the chemistry lab and I&#x2019;d never had to see the way my mom looked at me in that moment: like I was crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I really didn&#x2019;t want to be crazy. Nobody wants to be crazy, but now that I know what&#x2019;s happening to me, now that I understand what&#x2019;s going on in my head, I don&#x2019;t want to think about what it means to know you&#x2019;re crazy. To know that your family knows you&#x2019;re crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My stepdad, Paul, is a nice guy. He&#x2019;s good for my mom. They dated for years before they got married, and he always made the effort to keep up with my life, ask me about school, etc. He&#x2019;s an attorney who can give her the things she&#x2019;s had to do without since my dad left.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now that he knows about me, about the illness, things are different. He doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with me anymore. We&#x2019;ll still sit and watch TV, but I can almost hear him thinking when I&#x2019;m in the room. The weirdest feeling, aside from seeing things that aren&#x2019;t actually there, is sitting on the couch next to a grown man who is suddenly afraid of me. He didn&#x2019;t used to be afraid. It&#x2019;s hard not to take that personally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What am I afraid of? Pass. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll figure it out soon enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The good thing is that he actually does love my mom. And since my mom loves me, he makes an effort. He was the one who suggested the new private school instead of tossing me back into a school where all the kids knew there was something wrong with me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In two weeks, I start my junior year at St. Agatha&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s a K&#x2013;12 school. My mom and Paul made the staff aware of my &#x201c;condition,&#x201d; and because it&#x2019;s Catholic, they can&#x2019;t exactly turn me away. That would be pretty hypocritical. From what I know about the guy, Jesus wouldn&#x2019;t turn me away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul also made sure that my new school knows not to talk about my illness. As a lawyer, he explained that legally they aren&#x2019;t allowed to tell anyone what I have, which I appreciate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s hard starting as a junior in a new school. It&#x2019;s significantly more difficult to make friends when people know you see things you shouldn&#x2019;t be able to see.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dosage: 0.5 mg. Same dosage. Adam still unwilling to speak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>August 22, 2012</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I became an expert on my condition the second I was diagnosed. I can tell anyone who wants to know all the drugs, the most recent studies, the positive and negative symptoms. When I say &#x201c;positive&#x201d; and &#x201c;negative,&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t mean &#x201c;good&#x201d; and &#x201c;bad.&#x201d; It basically all sucks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Positive&#x201d; refers to symptoms caused by the disorder. Like delusions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Negative&#x201d; symptoms are reduced by the disorder. Like lack of initiative and motivation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There really is no clear path for the disease to travel. Some people have visions. Some people hear voices. And some people just get paranoid. My mom would also want me to take a minute to tell you about the huge strides in medicine to help people cope with the side effects. She&#x2019;s a glass-half-full kind of woman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whole seeing and hearing things that other people can&#x2019;t is like something straight out of Harry Potter. Like in The Chamber of Secrets when he heard the voice through the walls. Keeping it a secret made me feel privileged, like waiting for my letter from Hogwarts to arrive. I thought maybe it would mean something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But then Ron ruins that possibility when he says, &#x201c;Hearing voices no one else can hear isn&#x2019;t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.&#x201d; Harry ended up being fine. Nobody sent him to therapy or tried to give him pills. He just got to live in a world where everything he thought he&#x2019;d heard and seen turned out to be real. Lucky bastard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t really complain about pills, though. Things have gotten better since I started the new drug. We won&#x2019;t know how it really affects me until I&#x2019;ve been on the full dosage for a while. They&#x2019;re easing me into it, which you already know. Part of the reason I&#x2019;m required to sit in your office once a week is so you can spot any problems and report back to the clinical trial doctors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You asked what I know about my treatment. So I&#x2019;ll tell you all the stuff you already know. The drug is called ToZaPrex, which, according to the label, can cause, among other things, (1) decreased white blood cell count (which hinders the body&#x2019;s ability to combat disease), (2) seizures, (3) severely low blood pressure, (4) dizziness, (5) trouble breathing, and (6) severe headaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My doctors have assured my mother that the worst side effects are really rare. And not to worry. Ha. Yeah. Don&#x2019;t worry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve experienced some of the side effects. Headaches mostly. The kind that sort of nest in your brain and throb for a while until they get bored and leave you alone. I don&#x2019;t feel compelled to act out everything that runs through my mind, which is nice. But it doesn&#x2019;t make the visions go away. I still see things I know I shouldn&#x2019;t be seeing. The difference is that I know I shouldn&#x2019;t be seeing them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do I see? Well, let&#x2019;s start with who. I see Rebecca. I know now that she isn&#x2019;t real because she never changes. She&#x2019;s beautiful and tall--like Amazon tall--with huge blue eyes and long hair that falls to her waist. And she&#x2019;s sweet and never says a word. As far as hallucinations go, she&#x2019;s completely harmless. I&#x2019;ve only ever seen her cry once, the day my mom found out about me. When it happened, I still thought Rebecca was real. I didn&#x2019;t understand that she was crying because I was crying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And no, Rebecca isn&#x2019;t the only one I see, but I don&#x2019;t like to talk about the others. The more I think about them, the more likely they are to appear, and they . . . ruin things. It&#x2019;s like they wait for my mind to quiet down before they show up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, the visions usually start with something small, something moving out of the corner of my eye or a voice that sounds familiar and then stays with me for hours. And sometimes it&#x2019;s just a feeling that someone somewhere is watching me, which I know is ridiculous. Why would anyone bother, right? But I still keep the blinds drawn. I don&#x2019;t really know why. I guess it&#x2019;s just the need for privacy. I&#x2019;d like to, for once, feel properly alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A month ago, before I started taking ToZaPrex, I couldn&#x2019;t tell when I was slipping out of control. I would be afraid for no reason. Everything I saw was real to me. Once the hallucinations started, there was no switching them off. I could be lost in them for hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, when my mind starts misbehaving, I can at least watch its projections like a movie. Real CGI shit. Sometimes it&#x2019;s actually kind of beautiful. I can watch a whole field of grass erupt into a cloud of butterflies. Sometimes voices serenade me to sleep, and now that I know they&#x2019;re not real, I&#x2019;m not afraid of them. So that&#x2019;s nice. It&#x2019;s the stuff that jumps out at me that makes me look like a spaz.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No, I&#x2019;m not nervous about starting school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I got my new uniform. White polo shirt, red wool vest with school insignia, and butt-ugly navy-blue shorts that flare out from my waist and hang like elephant skin.

I honestly don&#x2019;t get how you can sit there, read my journal entries aloud, and then ask questions for an entire hour while I say nothing. That&#x2019;s weird.

And it&#x2019;s not even over yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have my driver&#x2019;s license, and I have no intention of getting it anytime soon because it just seems like one more thing I have to figure out and be responsible for. And it&#x2019;s just not worth it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At my last school, I usually walked, but my mom insisted on driving me on my first day at St. Agatha&#x2019;s. There was something manic in the way she drove, like she wanted it to be casual but she was way too nervous to actually pull that off. But when we finally got to the line of cars outside school, she just smiled and said, &#x201c;Have a good day.&#x201d; I could tell she wanted to kiss me goodbye, but once, when I was eight, I got mad at her for doing that in front of people, and she&#x2019;s restrained herself ever since. I wish I hadn&#x2019;t done that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty sure I just trudged out of the car with my backpack. I meant to smile at her reassuringly but forgot at the last minute.

Let&#x2019;s focus on those, shall we?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You asked how it was different from my last school. It wasn&#x2019;t, really, aside from the uniforms. Everyone still looked miserable. No one was awake yet. And there was a definite feeling of Why me? So there was some solidarity in that, I suppose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My first mission after finding my locker and putting my stuff down was to meet with my school ambassador, Ian Stone. Apparently, all new kids are assigned a school ambassador who is responsible for showing them the school and walking them to class. He was waiting in the front office when I got there, and I knew immediately that he was a douche. It wasn&#x2019;t the hair or the way he looked me up and down when we shook hands or the fact that he was chewing gum with his mouth open. It was just something about the air around him. It was like he was taking up more space than was strictly necessary. His grin never quite reached his eyes as he scanned the room.</p></p><h2>Woman, Thou Art Loosed!: Healing the Wounds of the Past</h2><p><p><b>You Were Meant to Live Free, Healed, and Whole!</b></p> <p><i>And when Jesus saw her, he called her to Him, and said unto her; Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</i> Luke 13:12 KJV</p> <p>Do you feel imprisoned by past failures&#x2014;like you just can't break free from all the guilt, condemnation, and shame?

An editorial team including his son Kim Stafford, the poet Naomi Shihab Nye, and the poet, translator, and author Robert Bly collaborated on shaping this book of Stafford's pioneering career in modern poetry. The poems in <i>The Way It Is</i> encompass Stafford's rugged domesticity, the political edge of his irony, and his brave starings-off into emptiness.</p></p><p>What we remember about a lyric poet is an extremely small fraction of the total work; time, aided by editors, creates a reputation out of about five great poems. In the case of William Stafford, <i>The Way It Is</i> has considerably expanded the field of candidates. His widely anthologized "Ceremony," "Thinking for Berky," and "Traveling through the Dark" are here, along with other contenders, including "Adults Only," which begins, "Animals own a fur world; / people own worlds that are variously, pleasingly bare." A writer of silence, loss, memory, and conviction, Stafford wrote a poem almost every morning, rising at four to eat toast and compose. This is a part of his myth that the Stafford industry--other poets, workshop leaders, old friends--agrees is admirable, the hard-working farmhand who beats the cows to the dairy barn. Stafford's poem-a-day habit certainly made things difficult for his literary executors Kim Stafford, Naomi Shihab Nye, and Robert Bly. Nonetheless, <i>The Way It Is</i> manages to encompass a pleasingly varied survey of Stafford's 35- book career, from his first collection, <i>West of Your City</i>, published in 1960, to the lyric written on the morning of his death on August 28, 1993. Not every poem is as perfect as "The Farm on the Great Plains"; some of them are embarrassingly sentimental, and the editors have curiously omitted a number of Stafford's better and more complicated poems in favor of more recent unpublished ones that he presumably didn't have time to revise. But all Stafford poems are worth reading at least once, and in the absence of a many-volumed Collected Poems, <i>The Way It Is</i> is a useful compromise, making available poems from his moral, religious, secular, maverick, political, and apolitical modes--all of them wise and at once exquisitely rhetorical and deeply imagistic. <i>--Edward Skoog</i><p><i>So, the world happens twice--</i><br><i>once what we see it as;</i><br><i>second it legends itself</i><br><i>deep, the way it is.</i></p><p>William Stafford filled his life and ours with poetry of challenge and consolation. <i>The Way It Is</i> gathers unpublished poems from his last year, including the poem he wrote the day he died, as well as an essential selection of works from throughout his career.

What emerges here is Stafford's faith in language and the soul, those things that form the base for his artistic gyroscope. This collection reveals the depth and breadth of a poet for whom the art was to make a life richly lived.</p><p>Born in Hutchinson, Kansas, in 1914, William Stafford was one of our most prolific and celebrated poets. He was a witness for peace, and for honesty, recognizing in his writing that "justice will take us millions of intricate moves." Author of over fifty books, and recipient of the National Book Award for <i>Traveling through the Dark</i>, Stafford was a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark College, and a traveling teacher throughout the world. As a conscientious objector during World War II, he began his unswerving habit of writing before dawn each day, and his habitual generosity to other writers and readers. After serving as consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1970, he was named Oregon's Poet Laureate in 1975. He died at his home in Oregon in 1993.</p></p><h2>Jedi Twilight (Star Wars: Coruscant Nights I)</h2><p>With the dark ascension of the Empire, and the Jedi Knights virtually wiped out, one Jedi who escaped the massacre is slated for a date with destiny&#x2013;and a confrontation with Darth Vader.<br><br>Jax Pavan is one of the few Jedi Knights who miraculously survived the slaughter that followed Palpatine&#x2019;s ruthless Order 66.

Sibert Informational Book Honor (Awards))</h2><p>The story of Sequoyah is the tale of an ordinary man with an extraordinary idea&#x2014;to create a writing system for the Cherokee Indians and turn his people into a nation of readers and writers. The task he set for himself was daunting. Sequoyah knew no English and had no idea how to capture speech on paper. But slowly and painstakingly, ignoring the hoots and jibes of his neighbors and friends, he worked out a system that surprised the Cherokee Nation&#x2014;and the world of the 1820s&#x2014;with its beauty and simplicity. James Rumford&#x2019;s Sequoyah is a poem to celebrate literacy, a song of a people&#x2019;s struggle to stand tall and proud.</p><p>Master storyteller James Rumford combines his love for art and history in his picture books. Each of his books is vastly different in its content, design, and illustrations but one aspect remains constant throughout his work: his passion about his subjects. Rumford, a resident of Hawaii, has studied more than a dozen languages and worked in the Peace Corps, where he traveled to Africa, Asia, and Afghanistan. He draws from these experiences and the history of his subject when he is working on a book. His book Sequoyah: The Cherokee Man Who Gave His People Writing was a 2005 Sibert Honor winner.Starred Review. Grade 1-4&#x2013;Fascinated by the Giant Sequoias they see during a California vacation, unnamed children listen to their father tell of the trees' namesake from the opposite side of North America. Thus, in short paragraphs accompanied by richly textured illustrations, Rumford presents the seminal events in Sequoyah's life, culminating in his invention of the Cherokee syllabary. The author writes with a concise eloquence that echoes the oral tradition and makes this one of those rare gems of read-aloud nonfiction. As in his other picture books, the artwork is executed in a style and medium that evoke the period and culture of the subject, in this case creating bold-lined scenes reminiscent of 19th-century woodblock prints. Done in ink, watercolor, pastel, and pencil, the illustrations were adhered to a rough piece of wood, and its textures were highlighted through the use of chalk and colored pencil. The perfect finishing element is the parallel text in Cherokee, which not only demonstrates the product of Sequoyah's genius but also makes this beautiful book readily accessible to Cherokee children in their own language. The end matter includes additional facts and the complete syllabary. <i>Sequoyah</i> is a perfect companion to Rumford's other picture books on important world scholars from history and legend&#x2013;Jean-Fran�ois Champollion, Ibn Battuta, Cadmus&#x2013;whose (mostly linguistic) achievements are comparatively unsung. A must-have for all collections.<i>&#x2013;Sean George, Memphis-Shelby County Public Library &amp; Information Center, Memphis, TN</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book makes the case that the divine image can be seen in not just one or two aspects of human identity but in all of them. The author, a specialist in early Christianity, reveals the light that leading theologians of the early church shed on contemporary discussions of what it means to be human. Each chapter explores a different facet of the divine image and likeness and maps out a path that can lead toward wholeness and holiness. This fresh approach to theological anthropology brings Greek patristic theology to students in a readable fashion.</p><p><b>Early Christian Insights Concerning What It Means to Be Human<br></b><br>"Sister Nonna writes as an expert in the early Christian world and its literature, but she presents the fruits of her learning in a form that is readily accessible to every reader. Her style is simple yet profound, vivid yet never overstated. . . . Here truly is a work that I can recommend with all my heart."--<b>Metropolitan Kallistos (Ware) of Diokleia</b> (from the foreword)<br><br>"A straightforward account of ancient Greek anthropology and spirituality that shows other, non-Augustinian methods for understanding the human condition before God. This side of patristic theological development deserves to be heard."--<b>D. H. Williams</b>, Baylor University<br><br>"Clarity, simplicity, beauty, and depth--these are the gifts offered to the reader in this distillation of all that the Christian tradition has signified by claiming that humanity is created in the image of God and may grow into God-likeness. This book is a model of how to appropriate the church fathers for Christians today."--<b>Frances Young</b>, University of Birmingham, England<br><br>"This book is a gift, written in a voice that is inviting, deeply personal, and generous. Yet the lucidity and accessibility of Harrison's presentation never compromises the profundity and genuineness of its content, which is always true to the early Christian sources on which she draws. This book is also a rarity: comprehensible, practical, embodied theology. It is founded upon the author's decades of study but also reflects a life lived in alertness to the Word of God spoken in a painfully broken world. It deserves, and will richly repay, the wide audience to which it is addressed."--<b>Peter C. Bouteneff</b>, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary<br><br>"This is a wonderful book. Sister Nonna Harrison provides a masterful guide for Christian formation that is based on God's love and care from the very act of creation to the <i>eschaton</i>. She opens for us the Eastern part of early Christianity, providing an alternative to the expected--for Western readers--understanding of postlapsarian 'human nature' as inherently 'bad,' and shows how early Christians, from theologians to desert mothers and fathers, understood the divine image as inherent in who we are."--<b>George Kalantzis</b>, The Wheaton Center for Early Christian Studies, Wheaton College<b>Nonna Verna Harrison</b> (PhD, Graduate Theological Union), an experienced patristics scholar, is the author of <i>Grace and Human Freedom according to St. Gregory of Nyssa</i> and numerous articles and translations.</p><h2>Galapagos: A Natural History, Revised and Expanded</h2><p><p>Twenty thousand copies of the first edition of <em>Gal�pagos</em> were sold.

Now sixteen years later, Bobby&#x2019;s bold and vivacious take on this cuisine has made him a fixture on America&#x2019;s culinary scene and turned Mesa Grill into a veritable institution. In <i>Bobby Flay&#x2019;s Mesa Grill Cookbook</i>, the celebrity chef invites you to join him in the kitchen of his famous restaurant to learn the secrets of his of his signature contemporary Southwestern cuisine. <br><br>Here are 150 recipes for the drinks, appetizers, soups, salads, main dishes, sides, sauces, desserts, and brunch dishes that have earned Bobby his reputation for creating innovative combinations and big, rich flavors, including:<br><br><b>- Grilled Asparagus and Goat Cheese Quesadillas with Tomato Jam and Cilantro Yogurt<br>- Queso Fundido with Roasted Poblano Vinaigrette<br>- Sweet Potato and Roasted Plantain Soup with Smoked Chile Crema<br>- Grilled Shrimp Brushed with Smoked Chile Butter and Tomatillo Salsa<br> - Seared Tuna Tostado with Black Bean Mango Salsa<br>- Coffee-Rubbed Filets Mignons with Ancho-Mushroom Sauce<br>- Spicy Coconut Tapioca with Mango and Blackberries<br></b><br>Complete with a guide no tequila lover should be without, a list of must-haves for the Southwestern pantry, menu suggestions for festive occasions with friends and family, Bobby's pointers on basic cooking techniques, and 100 full-color photographs, <i>Bobby Flay&#x2019;s Mesa Grill Cookbook</i> helps you re-create the fun and flavors of Mesa Grill in your own kitchen.</p><p>You've got to hand it to Bobby Flay. He opened his first restaurant, the inventive "new southwestern" Mesa Grill, in 1991--and he's still celebrating the sweet, hot and spicy at that Manhattan outpost, not to mention on his TV shows and in other cookbooks like <i>Boy Gets Grill</i> and <i>Bobby Flay's Bold American Food</i>. <i>Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill Cookbook</i> offers 140-plus recipes for a wide range of new "signature dishes," such as BBQ Duck Filled Blue Corn Pancakes with Haba�ero Sauce; Chile Rubbed Short Ribs with Creamy Polenta and Cotija Cheese; and Grilled Red Snapper with Tomato-New Mexico Red Chile Sauce.

Even drinks get the Flay treatment. <p> His food (at least in moderation) is difficult not to like. Cooks will find the recipes eminently doable if they're willing to cull the necessary ingredients--there's a fine ingredients glossary--and put aside a bit of time. This is great "occasion cooking" and should appeal to dyed-in-the-grill Flay fans, as well as those whose curiosity has been tickled by his winning culinary hegemony. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Bobby Flay opened his first restaurant, Mesa Grill, in 1991 and quickly developed a following for his innovative Southwestern cuisine. The restaurant continues to get high marks in <i>The Zagat Survey</i> for its regional American cuisine and has spawned two offshoots, Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas and Mesa Grill Atlantis in the Bahamas. Bobby opened Bolo in 1993, Bar American in 2005, and Bobby Flay Steak in 2006.

This compelling account of Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s remarkable testimony&#x2014;combined with historical, theological, and political elements and enhanced with photos&#x2014;brings the story to life. How did Bonhoeffer become someone who would defend God&#x2019;s truth, even when it was a matter of life and death? How did he endure the hardships that came with his faithfulness? How might we respond similarly to injustices today?</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Eric Metaxas vividly portrays the struggles and faith of Bonhoeffer, a man who had the courage to follow his convictions into Nazi Germany and stand up for the truth of God.</p></p><p><p>Eric Metaxas&nbsp;is the #1&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<em>If You Can Keep It</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bonhoeffer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Amazing Grace</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Miracles</em>. His books have been translated into more than twenty-five languages. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>,&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The New Yorker</em>, and Metaxas has appeared as a cultural commentator on CNN, the Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. He is the host of&nbsp;<em>The Eric Metaxas Show</em>, a nationally syndicated daily radio show. Metaxas is also the founder and host of&nbsp;<em>Socrates in the City</em>, the acclaimed series of conversations on &#x201c;life, God, and other small topics,&#x201d; featuring Malcolm Gladwell, Dick Cavett, and Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, among many others. He is a senior fellow and lecturer at large at the King&#x2019;s College in New York City, where he lives with his wife and daughter.</p>Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a devout follower and teacher of Christianity, and it was his strong faith and belief in God that led him to plot and plan the assassination of one of the world's most feared tyrants and dictators, Adolf Hitler. Metaxas, however, doesn't just focus on the religious influences on Bonhoeffer but embraces all of the historical events that helped shape his life. Bonhoeffer, a twin, witnessed his older brothers proudly going off to war and then dying as a result of their allegiance to their country, Germany, so Bonhoeffer was well aware of the political changes in the air as Hitler took over the government. Even though Bonhoeffer studied abroad and worked for a time in Rome, and the United States, he was always cognizant of the struggles that Germans, especially those of Jewish descent, were enduring under Hitler's regime. Chapters in the audiobook are matched with the years chronicled in Bonhoeffer's journals, and writings, so listeners can easily follow the time line of events and correlate them to the events in Germany under Hitler's regime.

Some of her subjects grow in isolation, on remote mountainsides, private estates, or nature preserves; others maintain a proud, though often precarious, existence in the midst of civilization. All, however, share a mysterious beauty perfected by age and the power to connect us to a sense of time and nature much greater than ourselves. It is this beauty, and this power, that Moon captures in her remarkable photographs.<br> <br>This handsome volume presents nearly seventy of Moon&#x2019;s finest tree portraits as full-page duotone plates. The pictured trees include the tangled, hollow-trunked yews some more than a thousand years old that grow in English churchyards; the baobabs of Madagascar, called upside-down trees&#x201d; because of the curious disproportion of their giant trunks and modest branches; and the fantastical dragon&#x2019;s-blood trees, red-sapped and umbrella-shaped, that grow only on the island of Socotra, off the Horn of Africa.<br> <br>Moon&#x2019;s narrative captions describe the natural and cultural history of each individual tree, while Todd Forrest, vice president for horticulture and living collections at The New York Botanical Garden, provides a concise introduction to the biology and preservation of ancient trees. An essay by the critic Steven Brown defines Moon&#x2019;s unique place in a tradition of tree photography extending from William Henry Fox Talbot to Sally Mann, and explores the challenges and potential of the tree as a subject for art.</p><p><b>Beth Moon</b>, a photographer based in San Francisco, makes her exhibition prints exclusively with the platinum/palladium process, which affords the greatest possible permanence and tonal range. Moon&#x2019;s work has been published widely in magazines, and she is represented by galleries in the United States, Italy, Israel, Brazil, and Dubai.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>Beth Moon<br> <br> <i>Time is the shape of an old oak as the winds caress and sculpt the bark, defining hardship and beauty. Time is the trunk that splits apart in great age to accommodate the tempest. Evidence of time is revealed in the furrowed bark of an ancient tree, gnarled, crooked, and beautiful.<br> <br>Portraits of Change,<br>Portraits of Survival,<br>Portraits of Time.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d like to keep a clear picture, so if a tree is destroyed by storm, disease, greed, or lack of concern, I will have a record of its power and beauty for those who were not able to make the journey. I photograph these trees because I know words alone are not enough, and I want their stories to live on. I photograph these trees because they may not be here tomorrow.</i> <br> <br>I began this project while living in England, a country with an affinity for all things arboreal. From the first moment I saw an ancient yew, a love affair ensued. The United Kingdom has a high concentration of old trees, so it seems I was in the right place to start. My children were young at the time, and they often accompanied me on my travels, happy for the chance to explore new places.<br> <br>Early in the project, I photographed the massive Bowthorpe Oak, one of the greatest British oaks. Its full crown of left green foliage was quite a sight to behold. Just six months later, part of the crown was lost when a violent storm tore a major limb to the ground, causing other branches to collapse into the tree&#x2019;s hollow center.<br> <br>Elsewhere I found ancient relics living in a state of neglect or destined for sacrifice by the logger&#x2019;s chainsaw. These trees, taller than most buildings and older than many of our monuments, were often taken for granted. Equally disturbing is the threat of extinction many tree species are facing. For these reasons, I continued my work with a greater sense of purpose and urgency.<br> <br>Why do we need old trees? Beyond the sublime, old trees are biologically critical. They contain superior genes that have enabled them to survive through the ages, resistant to disease and other uncertainties. Their genetic heritage is invaluable for future research and reforestation. Old trees store a significant amount of carbon above and below the ground. They serve as a reservoir for species such as lichen, and contain rich communities of plants, animals, and insects that depend on this unique habitat created only by the passage of time. The disappearance of old-growth forests may be one of the most serious environmental issues today. It is time to embrace a larger view of nature as a network of interwoven relationships.<br> <br>Moving to the West Coast of the United States allowed me the opportunity to explore the ancient bristlecone pines and giant sequoias of California. Print sales allowed the further development of my work and trips to other continents. Planning was extensive. Some places could only be visited at certain times of the year. For example, the Yemeni island of Socotra, home to the remarkable dragon&#x2019;s blood trees, is inaccessible for many months at a time due to strong monsoon winds. I also carefully considered the best season to photograph each particular tree. In the case of the baobabs of Madagascar, I felt they presented better with full crowns of foliage, which meant traveling there during the rainy season. On the other hand, many grand oaks photographed better during the winter months, when they were bare of leaves, allowing their wildly twisted branches and full trunks to be seen clearly.<br> <br>In some countries, I was able to camp right under the trees I photographed, allowing me to take advantage of the last light of the day and the first rays of morning sun. Sleeping in the frankincense forest on Socotra, or in the salt pans of the Kalahari under giant baobab trees, was an experience unlike any other. I have never felt more vibrant and alive than on these occasions, my senses awakening to a landscape filled with birdsong and the light of stars.<br> <br>Many of the trees I photograph would be chosen by botanists as the best example of their species; I chose trees that are unique in their exceptional size, incredible age, heredity, or folklore. Or sometimes it was an unconventional beauty that I found irresistible. Many of them had overcome obstacles in their effort to survive, their very forms a testament to their resiliency. All of them remarkable.<br> <br>Few of these trees have signposts, and many have survived because they are out of reach of civilization, on mountainsides, private estates, remote islands, or protected land. Certain species exist only in a few isolated parts of the world. Wherever possible, I have listed the age of each tree, but this can be hard to determine accurately. Counting rings and carbon dating damages the trunk, and many old trees hollow out or appear to stop growing at certain stages. Moreover, tree growth often slows over time. Experts now agree that the best results are obtained by comparing the measurements of living trees to other examples of the same species that have been cut down already.<br> <br>I have remained loyal to my Pentax 6.7 film camera, using it for the majority of these shots. The many steps involved in creating the final print are just as important to me as capturing the image. The process I use for exhibition prints is platinum/palladium printing. By using the longest-lasting photographic process, I hope to speak about survival not only of man and nature, but of photography as well. For each print, I mix a tincture and I hand-paint onto heavy watercolor paper and expose to light. The metals are actually embedded into the fiber of the paper. A platinum print can last for centuries, drawing on the common theme of time and continuance, pairing photographic subject and process.<br> <br>As I complete my work on this book, I cherish many fond memories. I have since taken other photographs that I am happy with, but these trees hold a very special place in my heart, as they are the sole reason I began to work with a camera in 1999. They were the seeds planted in me, the inspiration that took root and grew.<br></p><h2>Dead Heat: A Jon Bennett Series Political and Military Action Thriller (Book 5)</h2><p><b><i>NYT</i> bestselling conclusion of <i>The Last Jihad</i> series<br>Over 250,000 copies sold</b><br><br>A battle is heating up in the most fiercely contested presidential election in American history.<br>Who will lead this bitterly divided country over the next four years?<br><br><b>&#x201c;One of the most entertaining and thought-provoking novelists of our day.

Its journey was short; it sailed around the southeast corner of England into the quiet harbor of Deal. There at the dock waited the ship&#x2019;s only cargo: a forty-four-year-old Anglican rector named Thomas Gage.<br><br> It was rare in the Royal Navy of the time that a warship would be sent to pick up a single man, and a mere country pastor at that. But Gage was a unique figure in English life: A long-dreamt-of empire was about to be launched in part because of a book he&#x2019;d written fifteen years before; the nation was preparing to send thousands of men to attack its archnemesis inspired by things that Thomas Gage, and he alone, claimed to have seen across the ocean. This mysterious man&#x2014;no portrait survives to this day&#x2014;was, as befits his role in this story, surrounded in life by controversy and black dread. He had ready access to the most powerful man in the country, Oliver Cromwell; indeed, the Fagons had been hastened around the corner of England &#x201c;by order of the Protector&#x201d; himself, and the Venetian ambassador wrote in a letter that Gage &#x201c;had many secret conferences&#x201d; with Cromwell in the months leading up to the ship&#x2019;s arrival. Before and after the mystery man arrived, England&#x2019;s leader had been found studying maps of far-off places, and a globe of the world had appeared, without explanation, on his desk. All because of the humble rector.<br><br> Gage&#x2019;s past was crowded with ghosts; men had perished with his name on their lips. The pastor came from a line of Englishmen who some considered saboteurs and infidels, while others swore they were the souls of Christian fortitude. Whether heroes or villains, the family had long since disowned Thomas; one sibling said he strove to erase every last memory of the man from his mind, while another wrote to a friend about &#x201c;our graceless brother,&#x201d; whose actions &#x201c;our whole family doth blush to behold.&#x201d; Thomas&#x2019;s father had cut off his inheritance years before, warned him never to return to England, even called him a lethal enemy, and Gage claimed that his older brother, a military hero, had made good on his father&#x2019;s threat and actually tried to have him murdered. All this resulted from Thomas Gage&#x2019;s years of religious intrigue: On his word, three men had recently been hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn prison, a procedure whose savagery is not suggested by the surgical description of it. The Fagons&#x2019; crew would not have welcomed Gage aboard the ship regardless of his past; priests on a ship were a bad omen, as it was believed that the great storm maker Satan sent tempests across the oceans to drown them. The black-suited pastor, the man who hanged his own friends, as the sole passenger? It couldn&#x2019;t be good luck.<br><br> As for the pastor, one can only imagine his thoughts as the frigate appeared on the horizon, sunlight sparkling off the surface of its twenty-two new brass guns. His writing life was behind him, and he wouldn&#x2019;t live to record his thoughts on this, the most momentous voyage of his life. But surely he was flooded with memories; the ship was to take him back across the ocean to a place of his youth, a place that had disappointed him terribly and was yet now giving him a second chance at glory. As always when trying to dip into Gage&#x2019;s inner life, one must consider his appetite for power; the black sheep of an illustrious family, he hungered to make his name, and this would be his last shot. In the book that had launched this voyage, he&#x2019;d written insouciantly to the leader of England, &#x201c;To your Excellency I offer a New World.&#x201d; Actually, he meant the New World, and the appearance of the Fagons represented Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s silent acceptance of the offer. As the ship touched the dock, Gage said his good-byes to his wife and three children; he would never see them again.<br><br> The ship headed back to Portsmouth, where a fleet was being fitted out for the expedition, an audacious spear that would be launched from the shores of England aimed at the vitals of a great world empire. No Englishman returned from its destination, or that at least was the legend: The enemy guarded its treasure house closely, and even natives from the nation that had conquered it needed to go through a long vetting process for permission to set foot there. But Gage had lived and explored in the forbidden kingdoms; it was said he was the only Englishman alive who had done so and came back to tell about it. Still, Cromwell was taking an extraordinary risk by trusting his expedition to the pastor&#x2019;s stories: The descriptions of the ports, the fortifications, the soldiers whom the English fleet would soon face all originated within the memory of this singular man. As he sailed into Portsmouth harbor after a quick voyage aboard the Fagons, Gage would have looked at the ships spread across the harbor and the feverish activity&#x2014;the dinghies ferrying men and supplies to the larger ships, the polishing of brass and repairing of rig and sail&#x2014;with deep satisfaction. I have done this, he must have said to himself. This is God&#x2019;s work and mine.<br><br> M M M<br><br> After a century of neglect, Portsmouth was again thriving under the expedition&#x2019;s demands. Its population of a few thousand people had sided with the Puritan Cromwell and his New Model Army against the forces of Charles I in the recent, savage civil war, and now it was being repaid in hard currency. The fleet of sixty ships was being repaired, outfitted, and manned (but not supplied with food, which would soon present a problem) in its docks. This meant a great deal of work in a time when the oceangoing vessel was one of the most technologically advanced machines Western societies produced; even small ships required the wood of hundreds of trees and carried three miles or more of rope. The port swarmed with activity, and the nautical grapevine hummed with a single question: Where are they headed? It was a major fleet; it must have grand ambitions. The most popular rumor held that Cromwell himself would arrive to lead the expedition on a surprise attack against Rome, seat of the pope, known simply to Protestants as &#x201c;the Great Whore.&#x201d;<br><br> But when the signal gun was fired, echoing out from the town across the slate-colored sea, and the expedition&#x2019;s troops began lining up to board the ships, the natives changed their minds. The army of approximately 2,500 men emerged from their lodgings and were judged, and judged harshly: These were not the soldiers of Cromwell&#x2019;s New Model Army, the famous Roundheads, a force whose ferocity was matched by its discipline; to look at them, these men came straight out of the gutter. Cutpurses, drunks, &#x201c;knights of the blade,&#x201d; incipient murderers. &#x201c;I believe they are not to be paralleled in the world,&#x201d; wrote Major Robert Sedgwick, who would later command the men, or try to. &#x201c;People so lazy and idle, as it cannot enter into the heart of any Englishman, that such blood should run in the veins of any born in England; so unworthy, so slothful, and basely secure: and have, out of a strange kind of spirit, desired rather to die than to live.&#x201d; But there was one man on the ships, anonymous as yet to history, who would give the lie to Sedgwick&#x2019;s words. In the space of eight short years, this brilliant leader would turn men like these stumblebums into what were perhaps pound for pound the best fighting men in the world. He&#x2019;d boarded at Portsmouth or would join up later in the islands; the historical record is unclear. Perhaps he even brushed by Gage on the crowded deck as the fleet churned westward. His name was Henry Morgan.<br><br> Young Henry had been born in Wales in 1635 to a lesser branch of the illustrious Morgans, growing up in either the village of Penkarne or in Llanrhymney; Welsh genealogists remain locked in battle over which town can claim him. Henry was certainly kin to the great Morgans of Tredegar, members of the uchelwyr class, roughly translated as &#x201c;the high ones.&#x201d; A family poet made the relationship between the main branch and the other families clear around 1661:<br><br> And so LanRumney yet must bend the knee,<br><br> And from Tredegar fetch their pedigree.<br><br> The only portrait of the young Morgan (now hanging at Tredegar) shows him as a plump-cheeked teenager, his chubby face framed by the rich brown curls of a wig. He looked like a dandy who might chase low-born maids and sponge off his father. Until, that is, you came to the eyes: They look out of the portrait coolly&#x2014;appraising, measuring, uninnocent.<br><br> The place that Morgan came from would not have gotten him instant respect in London. Wales was considered a rustic outback, peopled by farmers and a few squires connected by complex lines of kinship. To the English the Welsh were &#x201c;emotional, excitable people,&#x201d; wrote one historian, &#x201c;whose taste for toasted cheese . . . was matched only by their devotion to their tedious native patois and their even more tedious pedigrees&#x201d;; the clich� Welshman was a bumpkin &#x201c;remote in his mountain fastnesses, surviving on cheese and leeks, surrounded by goats and unpronounceable names.&#x201d; The English had a great deal of fun with the Welsh, most of it related to cheese, but there was at least one area in which they showed respect: warfare. Milton called Wales an &#x201c;old, and haughty nation proud in arms,&#x201d; and the Welsh were known to be crack soldiers. Morgan himself came from warrior stock; his two uncles, Thomas and Edward, were mercenaries who had left home to fight in wars all over Europe. When the Civil War broke out, Henry must have been told that the two brothers had chosen opposite sides to fight on: Thomas enlisted with Cromwell&#x2019;s New Model Army, and Edward pledged allegiance to the Royalists and King Charles I. As Thomas Gage had grown up hearing about martyrs and Scripture, Morgan grew up in a home filled with stories of war.<br><br> Edward Morgan fought close to home, as captain-general of the Royalist forces in South Wales, an important posting. Thomas Morgan was even more successful during the war. This &#x201c;little, shrill-voiced choleric man&#x201d; rose to become the right-hand man of Cromwell&#x2019;s most trusted general, George Monck, and was a key player in the attacks on Scotland and Flanders. He was wounded twice but survived to become one of the heroes of the war. Especially from Edward, who was posted close to Henry Morgan&#x2019;s home, young Henry would have learned the rudiments of siege tactics, artillery, and attack formations.<br><br> Judging from his later life, the young adventurer carried little of Gage&#x2019;s religious obsessions. The New World was for him a chance at riches and respect. He knew he was never going to earn them in the learned professions, as his meager education prevented those careers. &#x201c;I left the schools too young . . . ,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d later say, speaking of the law. &#x201c;And have been more used to the pike than the book.&#x201d; A long wooden stick topped with an iron spike, the pike was a vicious weapon commonly used in the English Civil War, and pikemen were often stationed in the front line of an army formation, ready to bear the brunt of a cavalry charge. Anyone who wielded a pike had undoubtedly seen death up close.<br><br> The young warrior was traveling to the New World hell-bent on making his fortune and advancing the fortunes of his family. His name especially was precious to him; he&#x2019;d later write, &#x201c; &#x2018;God preserve your Honour&#x2019; is and shall be the daily prayer of Henry Morgan,&#x201d; and he was famously tetchy about anyone who did not pay him the proper respect. The chip on his shoulder and the fact that he had so little schooling suggests that Henry Morgan did not grow up rich or coddled in Wales; the early exit from school could also indicate the extent to which normal life of the people there was thrown into chaos by the successive civil wars that engulfed En- gland during his boyhood years. In any case, he&#x2019;d joined the expedition with a burning desire to find the freedom to achieve his ends: adventure, estates, position. The last two were the same things that the lesser Morgans were forced to seek on bended knee from their more illustrious relatives. In the New World, the twenty-year-old Morgan was not going to bend his knee to anyone, unless it was to place it firmly on the neck of a Spanish officer.<br><br> Between these two men, Morgan and Gage&#x2014;one dreaming of a religious empire, the other of gold and vast estates&#x2014;you have rather neatly summed up the race for the New World.<br><br> M M M<br><br> The people of Portsmouth watched as the ships sailed, still mystified as to what change this would bring in their nation&#x2019;s fortunes. In fact, only a chosen few knew the destination. The orders given to the commanders were sealed and not to be opened until the fleet was under sail. Thomas Gage, however, knew that the target lay to the west: on the island of Hispaniola.<br><br> The lands across the Atlantic had fascinated Western societies for centuries. The ancient Greeks believed that the spirits of their heroes left their bodies at the moment of death and traveled to the &#x201c;Blessed Islands&#x201d; that dotted the distant waters, to reside there forever. To the Englishman of the seventeenth century, the New World combined the wonders of Shangri-la with the remoteness of Neptune. It was a place of gobsmacking riches only hinted at by the laundry list of treasure the Spanish had extracted: a gilded ruby eagle, weighing sixty-eight pounds with enormous emeralds for eyes; the two Mayan orbs representing the sun and moon respectively, one made of solid gold, the other of silver, and both &#x201c;as large as carriage wheels,&#x201d; with crisp images of the animals worked into the metal; the emeralds the size of a man&#x2019;s fist. They&#x2019;d even discovered a mountain, Potos�, seemingly made wholly of silver, whose gushing-forth of ore served &#x201c;to chastise the Turk, humble the Moor, make Flanders tremble and terrify England.&#x201d;<br><br> The New World that produced such wonders had been Spain&#x2019;s for many decades, ever since Pope Alexander VI stroked a line down the middle of a map of the world dividing the non-Christianized territories between Spain and Portugal. In 1494 the line of demarcation was shifted to 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, giving Brazil to Portugal and the rest of the lands, known and unknown, to Spain. England, France, and the Netherlands&#x2014;the other players in the great game of empire&#x2014;never agreed to the terms. In Cromwell&#x2019;s justification for his expedition to the New World, the division was called the pope&#x2019;s &#x201c;ridiculous gift,&#x201d; while King Francis I of France remarked acidly, &#x201c;&#x201d;I should like to see the clause in Adam&#x2019;s will that excludes me from a share in the world.&#x201d;<br><br> Spain, however, had the power to enforce its wishes on all comers. It was an unlikely hyperpower, whose lustrous fa�ade hid a faltering ability. But in 1654, as the leaders of the Hispaniola expedition, General Venables and William Penn, set out for the Americas, Spain was still a behemoth, the successor to Rome, and its control of the New World was largely uncontested. For its holdings there, the monarchy had enforced a policy of &#x201c;no peace beyond the line,&#x201d; meaning that all territories beyond Pope Alexander&#x2019;s line of demarcation were not governed by European peace treaties. Spain and its enemies were to be considered in perpetual conflict in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main&#x2014;the mainland of South and Central America. Although the Spanish kings declared this policy, the truth was that events in the West Indies would influence both relations between European nations and the treaties they negotiated.<br><br> Cromwell and his commanders wanted fervently to loosen Spain&#x2019;s grip on the riches of the Americas. Gage was their happy scout; his biography had become the blueprint for the invasion. But it also told a vicious tale all its own.</p><h2>Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder (A Hannah Swensen Mystery)</h2><p><b>Discover The Delicious Mystery That Started It All!</b><br><br>No one cooks up a delectable, suspense-filled mystery quite like Hannah Swensen, Joanne Fluke's dessert-baking, red-haired heroine whose gingersnaps are as tart as her comebacks, and whose penchant for solving crimes--one delicious clue at a time--has made her a bestselling favorite.

Please visit her online at www.JoanneFluke.comHannah Swensen of Lake Eden, Minnesota, has a better excuse than most of fictions lady sleuths to excuse her nosiness: her sister Andreas husband Bill Todd is deputy sheriff for the county and Hannah tirelessly maintains that shes helping him. During her inter-snooping hours, she runs The Cookie Jar, a coffee shop serving and selling the goodies Hannah bakes in the back of the store. Her supplies are delivered daily by Ron LaSalle, whom she often passes on her way to work. On this fateful day, Rons truck is soon parked behind the store, but he fails to reappear. When Hannah finds him seated in the truck, the window open, a bullet through his chest, shes inspired to work her way through the townspeople, looking for a motive for Rons death, even as she manfully resists her widowed mothers attempts to find her a husband. The annual bash given by wealthy Del and Judith Woodley pairs Hannah with pleasant dentist Norman Rhodes, but Hannah is soon caught up by the latest scandal: the disappearance of Nat Turner, owner of the huge Cozy Cow Dairy, who didnt show at the Buttermakers Convention, where he was to make the opening speech. Needless to say, its Hannah who finds Maxs body and evidence of the loan-sharking activities that provide a likely motive for his murder. Hannahs a likable sort despite her bent for taking over; the authors style is easygoing if slowed by too much inane chatter. In all: a modestly entertaining debut with some delectable recipes as a bonus. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He has written four books, including the #1 bestseller <i>Happiness Is a Serious Problem.</i> He has lectured on all seven continents and may be contacted through his website, DennisPrager.com.<b>Question 1</b><br><br><b>Can One Doubt God's Existence and Still Be a Good Jew?</b><br><br><i>God may have His own reasons for denying us certainty with regard to His existence and nature. One reason apparent to us is that man's certainty with regard to anything is poison to his soul. Who knows this better than moderns who have had to cope with dogmatic Fascists, Communists, and even scientists?</i><br><br>Emanuel Rackman, in <i>The Condition of Jewish Belief<br><br>If the believer has his troubles with evil, the atheist has more and graver difficulties to contend with. Reality stumps him altogether, leaving him baffled not by one consideration but by many, from the existence of natural law through the instinctual cunning of the insect to the brain of the genius and heart of the prophet. This then is the intellectual reason for believing in God: That, though this belief is not flee from difficulties, it stands out, head and shoulders, as the best answer to the fiddle of the universe.</i><br><br>Milton steinberg, <i>Anatomy of Faith</i><br><br>DOUBT<br><br><i>Does God exist? This is life's most crucial question.</i> The implications of the conclusion have the most significant consequences for the meaning of human existence.<br><br>Yet, despite its overwhelming importance, serious discussion of Cod is usually confined to theologians and philosophers. The rest of us form simple opinions of belief, agnosticism, or atheism at a relatively early age and are content to retain them without questioning for the rest of our lives.<br><br>We must therefore begin our presentation of Judaism with a discussion about God. First, let us briefly note Judaism's attitude toward a most common contemporary sentiment about God: doubt.<br><br><i>Can you doubt God's existence and still be a good Jew?</i> Yes.<br><br>Belief in God is often difficult. Crises of faith are to be expected, and acknowledging such crises is not an irreligious act for a Jew. There are four significant reasons why doubts about God's existence should not be an obstacle to your being a good Jew.<br><br>1. Judaism emphasizes deed over creed<br><br>Judaism stresses action far more than faith. The Talmud attributes to God a declaration which is probably unique among religious writings: "Better that they [the Jews] abandon Me, but follow My laws" (for, the Talmud adds, by practicing Judaism's laws, the Jews will return to God, <i>Jerusalem Talmud Haggigah</i> 1:7). According to Judaism, one can be a good Jew while doubting God's existence, so long as one acts in accordance with Jewish law. But the converse does not hold true, for a Jew who believes in God but acts contrary to Jewish law cannot be considered a good Jew.<br><br>It is not, of course, our intention to deny the centrality of God in Judaism, but merely to emphasize that Judaism can be appreciated and practiced independently of one's present level of belief in God. You can incorporate Judaism into your daily life through study and practice even while doubting God's existence, because Jewish study and practice in and of themselves are extraordinarily valuable to the individual and society.<br><br>Moreover, our experience has confirmed that once you begin to study and live Judaism, you will find belief in God much more feasible. As the Talmud notes, whereas a man or woman may begin to practice Judaism for reasons unrelated to God (such as rational and ethical conviction), he or she will eventually do so because of God <i>(Pesahim</i> 50b).<br><br>2. Absolute certainty in faith leads to fanaticism<br><br>In the words of Emanuel Rackman, one of the foremost Orthodox rabbis of our time: "Judaism encourages doubt even as it enjoins faith and commitment. A Jew dare not live with absolute certainty, because certainty is the hallmark of the fanatic and Judaism abhors fanaticism, [and] because doubt is good for the human soul, its humility....God may have had His own reasons for denying us certainty. with regard to His existence and nature. One apparent reason is that man's certainty with regard to anything is poison to his soul. Who knows this better than moderns who have had to cope with dogmatic Fascists, Communists, and even scientists?"<br><br>3. If God were known, moral choice would end<br><br>If we <i>knew</i> God existed and would punish us for evil acts, then good acts would be much less freely chosen. An element of unknowability about Cod is necessary so as to allow us to <i>choose</i> good. In order to choose good, we must feel free to do bad, and we would not feel this way if we had definite knowledge that God was present and recording our every action. (How much choice do we have to speed when we know a police car is present?)<br><br>4. Since God's existence is unprovable, doubt is natural<br><br>God cannot be known to exist in the sense that we know a table or a cat exists. Their existences can be physically demonstrated and verified through our senses. But God's existence cannot, since God possesses no physical qualities. <i>One can prove the existence of the natural, the physical, the finite; God, however, is supernatural, metaphysical, infinite.</i> The inability to prove God's existence reflects, then, only on the fact that God has no physical qualities, a position that Judaism has always maintained.<br><br>To have doubts about God is, then, normal, permissible, and consistent with being a good Jew. But a good Jew may not <i>deny God's existence.</i> Indeed, the primary task of the Jewish people since its inception has been to bring the idea of a universal God and morality, or ethical monotheism, to mankind. As we shall see below, the most important values of life are dependent upon positing the existence of God: morality, or good and evil as objective realities that transcend personal and national opinions, and ultimate purpose and meaning to human existence. To put it another way, if there is no God, then there can be no objective good and evil, and no ultimate purpose to our existence. For these reasons, among many others, a committed Jew (a) may not deny God's existence, (b) must struggle with his doubts about God (the name of the Jewish people, Israel, means "struggle with God"), and (c) must advocate ethical monotheism, the ideal of a universal God as the basis of a universal standard of ethical behavior. As Elie Wiesel stated it: "The Jew may love God, or he may fight with God, but he may not ignore God."<br><br>THE NEED TO POSIT GOD'S EXISTENCE<br><br>MORALITY<br><br>The first value whose existence is dependent upon positing God's existence is morality. If there is no God, there are no rights and wrongs that transcend personal preference. Gases and molecules, the laws of nature, are not "good" or "evil," "right" or "wrong." If the natural world is the one objective reality, and there is no moral source beyond nature, good and evil possess no objective reality. Moral judgments then become purely subjective. They are popular or personal opinions which are objectively meaningless and represent no reality. It is self-evident and acknowledged by the foremost atheist philosophers that if a moral God does not exist, neither does a universal morality. Without God, all we can have are <i>opinions</i> about morality, but our opinions about "good" and "evil" behavior are no more valid or binding than our opinions about "good" and "bad" ice cream.<br><br>This is why in secular societies morality is generally considered to be a matter of opinion. Moral relativism is the only possible consequence of the denial of God's existence; morality becomes a euphemism for personal opinion. As this century's most eloquent atheist philosopher, Bertrand Russell, wrote: "I cannot see how to refute the arguments for the subjectivity of ethical values but," Russell conceded, "I find myself incapable of believing that all that is wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don't like it."<br><br>Russell's second point is our whole point. All that can possibly be wrong with wanton cruelty according to atheism and its moral relativism, is that we may personally not like it. <i>Amorality is inherent to atheism.</i><br><br>To illustrate this point, assume there is no God and attempt to explain why Hitler was morally wrong. For the atheist and moral relativist, the only thing wrong with Nazi atrocities, as Russell said, "is that I don't like it."<br><br>One may answer that we know "deep down" that Hitler's mass murder and torture were wrong. But from where does this "deep down" feeling of right and wrong come? If there is no God, such feelings are just feelings, and objective morality must transcend subjective feelings. And if in fact we do possess "deep down" knowledge of good and evil, what source of morality put it within us?<br><br>Or, one may answer that Nazi-type murder is wrong for pragmatic reasons -- citing the argument that "if we kill them, they'll start to kill us and society will fall apart." This is not a moral argument, but merely a pragmatic one, and it is in any event invalid, since committing evil can be regarded as highly practical. In fact, pragmatic arguments usually favor committing the crime. The Nazis, for example, would have correctly dismissed the argument that "if we kill them, then they will kill us" by noting that "they" will not be able to kill "us." As in the rest of nature, only the weak will be destroyed. The pragmatic argument against committing evil is naive. If you can get away with a crime, there is no pragmatic argument against committing it -- only a moral argument, which is often quite impractical.<br><br>Take, for example, the relatively minor crime of tax evasion. The pragmatic argument again argues <i>for,</i> not against, committing the crime. The argument that "if everyone cheated on their tax returns, we would all suffer," understandably dissuades almost no one from cheating. On the contrary, tax evaders are quite certain that nearly everyone else <i>is</i> cheating, and it is precisely this fact that serves as their justification for doing the same. Precisely because one believes nearly everyone else is cheating, he, too, should cheat. Otherwise he loses. Pragmatism dictates immoral behavior at least as often as it dictates moral behavior.<br><br>Or, one may answer that <i>reason</i> tells us that Hitler was wrong, and, that in general, evil is wrong. Reason, according to this common attitude, suffices to lead us to moral behavior without the necessity of positing the existence of God. But is this so?<br><br>Reason often suggests evil behavior<br><br>Reason rarely argues for moral behavior. In fact, reason can nearly always be used to justify immoral behavior -- from supporting Nazism to petty cheating in everyday life. The use of reason to justify what is wrong is so common that we have a special word for it -- <i>rationalization.</i><br><br>Adolph Eichmann and other Nazi murderers acted "reasonably" when they obeyed orders to murder people and thereby furthered their careers. When the average German citizen remained silent while his Jewish neighbors were shipped to concentration camps, he was acting entirely according to reason. Reason suggested preserving one's life and not endangering it by aiding a Jew. It may in fact be argued that among the only people in Nazi Germany who acted against reason were those who acted morally.<br><br>To cite a more mundane example, according to the <i>New York Times,</i> one out of every three hotel guests steals something from his room. Since it is probable that most of these people consider stealing immoral, are we to assume that millions of Americans consider themselves thieves? No. Undoubtedly most will deny that what they have done is thievery; they <i>rationalize</i> their actions by claiming that the hotel overcharges, or that "everyone else" also takes "souvenirs," or that the towel (or ashtray, or painting) will not be missed.<br><br>In sum, <i>reason is amoral.</i> It is a human tool that can be used as easily for evil as for good.<br><br>Reason cannot demand good behavior (even when it suggests it)<br><br>The preceding examples should make it obvious that if reason often does not even suggest good behavior, it cannot possibly be relied upon to demand good behavior. And even when reason does argue for moral behavior, it is not reason that compels a person to act morally. Reason may very well have <i>suggested</i> to many Germans during World War II that they actively oppose Nazism and to many Americans that they not steal from their hotel rooms, but it in no way would <i>compel</i> them to act accordingly. And for the few Germans who did actively oppose Nazism, it was not reason that dictated their moral behavior. It was a recognition of something higher than reason that compelled them to act morally.<br><br>Thus, given these two facts, that reason can suggest evil, and that it cannot compel good behavior even when it suggests it, we can accurately characterize the notion that reason alone can or will produce moral behavior as a dangerous myth.<br><br>To return to our original question: If there is no God whose moral will transcends personal opinion, then we cannot say that Hitler was morally wrong. All we can say is "I don't like it."<br><br>The source of morality must itself be moral, and since reason is amoral, it cannot be the source of morality. That source must be something higher than reason. From the time the Jews stood at Mount Sinai to this day, that higher source has been called God.<br><br>ULTIMATE PURPOSE<br><br>Morality is not the only value whose existence is dependent upon positing the existence of God. If the physical world is the only reality, i.e., if there is no metaphysical source to life, then life is ultimately purposeless. Life is then nothing more than the chance result of innumerable coincidences, and human beings are nothing more than self-aware molecules. We differ from all other molecular combinations only in that we want to believe that our particular combination has some ultimate meaning and purpose. But this desire is mere delusion. We simply cannot bear to awaken each morning and look in the mirror at a molecular coincidence, so we make up a meaning to our lives.<br><br>The purposelessness of life if there is no God is not some argument created by theologians. It is a fact, and it underlies all secular existentialist thought. The argument of secular existentialism develops as follows: Given that God does not exist, life is mere physical coincidence with no meaning. Hence, we must endow our "being and nothingness," to use the well-chosen words of Jean-Paul Sartre, with some arbitrary meaning, or we cannot survive the pain of life.<br><br>For the Jew, the physical world is very real. But it is not the only reality. There is a metaphysical reality as well. The source of this metaphysical reality, God, has created the physical reality and has endowed the human being with a touch of the divine. This element can be called spirituality, or soul, or the image of God, or sanctity. By any name, it means the same: We are not purposeless physical creations of a cruel and apathetic universe, but purposeful spiritual creations of a loving and just God.<br><br>In order, then, to spread a universal standard of good and evil in the world, and because the death of belief in God must lead to moral chaos and a pervasive sense of meaninglessness, the Jew must posit and advance ethical monotheism even when he is in doubt about God. God's existence is demonstrably necessary for a moral world and for ultimate meaning to life.<br><br>Nevertheless, one may conclude that while God's existence is clearly <i>necessary,</i> belief in God's existence is irrational and even perhaps impossible. Let us therefore address ourselves to the question of the <i>probability</i> of God's existence.<br><br>DOES GOD EXIST?<br><br>There are strong arguments on both sides of this question, but in our view the case for the existenc...</p><h2>If the Dead Rise Not: A Bernie Gunther Novel</h2><p><b>Detective Bernie Gunther navigates two corrupt regimes in this&nbsp;&#x201c;richly satisfying mystery...that evokes the noir sensibilities of Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald while breaking new ground of its own&#x201d;(<i>Los Angeles Times</i>).<br></b> <br><i>Berlin, 1934</i>.

Smith examines politics through the lens of liturgy. What if, he asks, citizens are not only thinkers or believers but also lovers? Smith explores how our analysis of political institutions would look different if we viewed them as incubators of love-shaping practices--not merely governing us but forming what we love. How would our political engagement change if we weren't simply looking for permission to express our "views" in the political sphere but actually hoped to shape the ethos of a nation, a state, or a municipality to foster a way of life that bends toward shalom?<br><br>This book offers a well-rounded public theology as an alternative to contemporary debates about politics. Smith explores the religious nature of politics and the political nature of Christian worship, sketching how the worship of the church propels us to be invested in forging the common good. This book creatively merges theological and philosophical reflection with illustrations from film, novels, and music and includes helpful exposition and contemporary commentary on key figures in political theology.</p><p><b>A Political Theology of Culture<br></b><br>"Smith has written an essential guide to social life aimed at his fellow Christians but essential reading for all of his fellow citizens.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Gr. 2^-4. From the series that includes <i>Kites Sail High: A Book about Verbs</i> (1988) and <i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns</i> (1989), this volume explores yet another part of speech: prepositions. Although the rhyming text contorts sentence structure from time to time, it provides many examples of prepositions (printed in large, blue type) as well as some rules of usage. Large, colorful drawings illustrate the words imaginatively. While a child alone might find the text confusing, the many teachers who use the series will probably enjoy reading this book aloud to introduce or illustrate prepositions in their classrooms. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Encounters with Nature Spirits: Co-creating with the Elemental Kingdom (Findhorn Classics)</h2><p>A fascinating, first-hand account of the vast powers and true nature of the Elemental Kingdom <br><br>� Reveals deep wisdom, eloquently shared through the author&#x2019;s encounters with the great God Pan and his elemental subjects <br><br>� Offers a glimpse into the hidden layers of the natural world and the workings of the elemental kingdom <br><br>� Includes chapters by Mike Scott, David Spangler, Dorothy Maclean, and Brian Nobbs as well as beautiful illustrations by fine artist Elise Hurst, who perfectly captures the energy of the natural world and its subjects as we might perceive them <br><br>� Paper with French flaps <br><br><i>&#x201c;To anyone who may have expressed a wish to see and talk to nature spirits . . . remember it took 63 years for my wish to be granted, so don&#x2019;t lose hope.&#x201d;</i> <br><br>Have you ever wished for something with your whole heart? As a child, R. Ogilvie Crombie (Roc) made a wish as he dropped a penny into a wishing well - he asked to be able to see fairies and talk to them. In <i>Encounters with Nature Spirits</i>, we follow Roc&#x2019;s path as, many years later, he meets the faun Kurmos in the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh, discovers the realm of the elementals, and, eventually, meets the great god Pan himself. In his conversations with Pan, elves, and other nature spirits Roc realizes that the elemental realm is vastly more powerful than our human kingdom and possesses an ability to create far beyond our human means. <br><br>Through his experiences Roc becomes closely involved with the Findhorn Community in northeast Scotland where he meets further elementals who give him sound advice as to how the famous Findhorn gardens should be cared for in order to work in harmony with nature. <br><br><i>Encounters with Nature Spirits</i> is a reminder to us all of the importance of our relationship with the nature kingdom. Through his example, Roc places emphasis on connecting and working in harmony with nature spirits. True co-creation with nature, working <i>with</i> rather than <i>against</i> the elemental kingdom, can bring about vital positive change to our endangered eco-system. The elementals are open to working with mankind--the question is, are we humans open to engaging with and respecting them again?</p><p>Trained as a scientist in his early years, R. Ogilvie Crombie (Roc) (1899-1975) was a self-taught mythologist, psychologist, historian, and esotericist. A thespian at heart, he also displayed great interest in the fine arts, music, and theatre. Roc lived in and around Edinburgh and had a close connection to the Findhorn Community, Scotland.<b>Meeting Pan on Iona <br><br>Roc</b> <br><br>The next significant meeting was in early May on Iona, a tiny island of the Inner Hebrides which is considered to be an ancient centre of spiritual power. Peter Caddy and I were standing in the Hermit&#x2019;s Cell, a ring of stones which is all that is left of the place where Saint Columba used to go in retreat. It is about halfway across the island, almost on a level with Iona Abbey. <br><br>In front of us was a gentle grassy slope, and I became aware of a large figure lying in the ground there. I could see him through the grass. It appeared to be a monk in a brown habit with the hood pulled over his head so that his features were concealed. His feet were towards me. <br><br>As I watched, he raised his hands and rolled back the hood. It was Pan. He rose up out of the ground and stood facing us, an immense figure at least twenty-five feet tall. As he did so, the habit fell away. He was smiling and said: &#x2018;I am the servant of Almighty God, and I and my subjects are willing to come to the aid of mankind, in spite of the way it has treated us and abused nature, if it affirms belief in us and asks for our help.&#x2019; <br><br>Through this and other encounters with Pan, I would come to a greater understanding of why Pan and the nature spirits were choosing to communicate with me. Here was a step towards the reconciliation of Pan and the world of the nature spirits with humanity. Because I had been able to respond to him without fear, Pan could communicate with me and use me as a mediator between humanity and nature. This does not make me important in myself--I am simply a channel for his work. <br><br>Vital to this reconciliation is the recognition of Pan&#x2019;s true nature. He is a great being, the god of the whole elemental kingdom as well as of the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms. People may feel uneasy in his presence because of the awe he inspires, but there ought to be no fear. <br><br>&#x2018;All human beings are afraid of me,&#x2019; he had said at our first meeting, not as a threat but with sadness. &#x2018;Did the early Christian church not take me as a model for the devil?&#x2019; That is why Pan is feared--because of the image projected onto him. This stigma must be lifted in order to re-establish the true link between humanity and nature. <br><br>Pan has said to me he would prefer not to be represented in any material form at all. yet, if he must be, he insists on being accepted, in our culture, as the Greek myth depicts him, half human, half animal. There is a fitness about it in its symbolism. The human upper half represents intellect, united with a powerful, mysterious, deep energy represented by the animal lower half--an energy not yet revealed in humanity. <br><br>It is important to consider Pan and the nature spirits in their own right when they take on these human-like forms and not compare them with our own perception of human beauty. Some people assume that Pan must be ugly. This is far from the case. In his own right he is one of the most beautiful beings I have ever seen. Only the horns on the forehead, the cloven hooves and the fine silky hair on the legs suggest the animal part. The legs themselves are human, not animal. <br><br>It is very important to realise that though Pan can appear in such a form, he is not a being restricted to one place. The word &#x2018;pan&#x2019; also means &#x2018;all&#x2019;, &#x2018;everywhere&#x2019;. Pan is a universal energy, a cosmic energy, which is constantly found throughout the whole of nature. He could appear personified in many different places at the same time and should never be thought of as restricted to a corner of the garden or sitting on a hilltop beside a gorse bush. <br><br>It may be helpful to consider why Pan and the nature spirits assume such forms. Their primary state is what may be termed a &#x2018;light body&#x2019;. It is a whirl or vortex of energy in constant motion. Nebulous like a fine mist, it glows with coloured light, sometimes one single colour, sometimes two or more which do not mix but remain separate like the colours of a rainbow. It frequently changes colour and is often covered with a multitude of fine curved lines, which appear to flow like liquid in a pipe, forming continually changing patterns of incredible beauty. <br><br>These light bodies differ from each other in size and brilliancy, varying from pastel shades to strong, bright colours. All are beautiful, pure and luminous, glowing with inner radiance. They may be regarded as whirls of energy, but energy with intelligence. It is possible to see and to communicate with these light bodies. <br><br>However, the elementals or nature spirits cannot carry out their work with plants in these pure bodies. In this work they use the energies channelled to them by the devas to build up an &#x2018;etheric body&#x2019; or &#x2018;etheric counterpart&#x2019; for each plant, according to its archetypal pattern. The plant grows and develops within this counterpart. In order to fulfil their task, the nature spirits too must take on an etheric body. <br><br>In esoteric knowledge, the etheric plane is made up of a fine energy substance from which is created the mould for every form we see manifest on the physical plane. Each material form has an etheric counterpart. That such a thing exists at all will be questioned by many people. At the moment it cannot be scientifically proven, though no doubt this will be possible in the future. We do know ourselves to be far more than just our physical bodies.</p><h2>MasterLife - Leader Guide</h2><p><p><b>MasterLife</b> is an excellent family of resources to guide both new and experienced believers to develop lifelong, obedient relationships with Jesus Christ.

Mary and her husband, Henry Howard, live in Cliffwood, one of the beautiful antebellum homes for which Natchez is famous.<br> &nbsp;<br> Odd things have been happening in the house for years, and the French Room in particular has become the focal point for spooky sensations. The Ducotes suspect the ghostly goings-on are caused by the living, but when a relative of the Catlins is found dead in the room, An'gel and Dickce must sift through a haunted family history to catch a killer.</p><p><b>Miranda James</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Cat in the Stacks Mysteries and the Southern Ladies Mysteries.Chapter 1<br><br> "Do you mean to sit there and tell me you think Cliffwood really is haunted?" Miss An'gel Ducote regarded her sister with a frown.<br><br> Miss Dickce Ducote shrugged. "There've been stories about that house for decades, Sister. Anyway, you know Natchez is supposed to be one of the most haunted towns in the country."<br><br> "Yes, I know," An'gel replied with a sniff. "I just don't ever recall hearing that Cliffwood was riddled with ghosts as you put it." Her brow wrinkled as she paused to think. "At least I don't remember hearing Jessamine or her husband, Marshall, ever talk about it."<br><br> Dickce snorted. "That old goat. He was too busy running around after women to notice ghosts. How Jessy put up with him for all those years, I'll never know."<br><br> "Fifty years ago, women thought they had to put up with it for the sake of their sons," An'gel said. "Not to mention that Jessy would have starved if Marshall had left her for another woman. She was one of the sweetest girls I ever knew, but she could get lost in her own closet. She'd never have kept a job."<br><br> "That's a terrible thing to say about an old sorority sister." Dickce snorted with laughter. "Even if it's true." She laughed again.<br><br> "At least Marshall had the good sense to die before he threw away all his money; otherwise she'd have had to sell Cliffwood."<br><br> "We've wandered away from the subject." Dickce pointed to the letter An'gel held. "Mary Turner and Henry Howard Catlin are asking for our help. Even if we don't quite believe in ghosts, Mary Turner evidently does."<br><br> "I know." An'gel laid the letter aside on her desk. "I suppose we could go spend a few days in Natchez and see what's going on. I suspect there's nothing supernatural about it. Someone's playing tricks on them, I'd say."<br><br> "You're probably right," Dickce replied. "I'm game to go ghost-hunting, and I'll bet Benjy will get a hoot out of the whole thing."<br><br> "No doubt," An'gel said. Their young ward, Benjy Stephens, had a lively intelligence and a healthy curiosity, and he would enjoy seeing the antebellum treasures of Natchez, potential apparitions included. "We can't take that for granted, however, and I wouldn't want him to feel obliged to go if he's uncomfortable with the idea."<br><br> "I don't think the idea of ghosts will faze him all that much. Besides, Peanut and Endora can help, too," Dickce said. "Animals are supposed to be sensitive to ghosts. If there are any supernatural presences at Cliffwood, they'll let us know."<br><br> "Let's hope they don't run across any tortured spirits that need to be laid to rest." An'gel grimaced. "I'll call Mary Turner and tell her we'll come on Monday. That ought to give you enough time to pack."<br><br> Dickce rolled her eyes at her sister. "I'm not the one who has to have a different pair of shoes for every outfit I take."<br><br> "If you wore anything other than dark colors in the autumn months, you might see the need." An'gel reached for her cell phone. "Why don't you go tell Benjy about the trip and see what he thinks of the idea of ghost-hunting?"<br><br> Dickce nodded and walked out of the study.<br><br> An'gel skimmed through Mary Turner's letter again. Given the contents, she wasn't surprised that the young woman had chosen to write a letter, rather than simply calling. An'gel appreciated having the time to think about Mary Turner's story rather than having to respond immediately during a live conversation. She did wonder, however, why Mary Turner hadn't e-mailed her after all. She decided she would ask during the call.<br><br> She picked up her cell phone and tapped out the number. After three rings, a high, light voice said, "Hello, Mary Turner Catlin speaking."<br><br> An'gel identified herself. "Sister and I were discussing your letter, and of course we'd be happy to help you in any way we can."<br><br> Before An'gel could continue, Mary Turner broke in. "Oh, Miss An'gel, bless you and Miss Dickce. Henry Howard and I are about to go stark raving mad, and we didn't know whom else to turn to. Grandmother always said the Ducote sisters never lost their heads in a crisis, no matter what." She paused for a moment. "And if this isn't a crisis, I don't know what is. We're completely booked for Thanksgiving in two weeks, and if word gets out about this, we stand to lose a substantial amount."<br><br> An'gel heard a strangled sob. "Your grandmother was a dear friend, and Sister and I will do our best to live up to her confidence in us. I'm sorry that you and Henry Howard are so upset by all this. There's got to be a perfectly rational explanation behind what's happening there."<br><br> Mary Turner sobbed again, then choked it off. "I pray every day and night that there is, but we . . ." Her voice trailed off.<br><br> An'gel frowned. Had Mary Turner hung up? Or had her darn cell phone dropped the call? She waited a moment for Mary Turner to come back on the line, but when she didn't, An'gel ended the call. After about ten seconds she called again. Mary Turner answered immediately.<br><br> "I'm so sorry," the young woman said. "But that's the kind of thing that's always happening. Phone calls get cut off, our e-mails don't go anywhere, all kinds of odd things. That's why I wrote you an actual letter instead of e-mailing you."<br><br> "Heavens, this really is a mess," An'gel said, shocked by Mary Turner's words. "I wondered why you chose a letter. I can't remember when I last received an actual handwritten letter from anyone."<br><br> Mary Turner sounded grim when she responded. "So far the ghosts haven't been able to stop the post office from working."<br><br> "It's no wonder you and Henry Howard are at your wit's end," An'gel said. "Sister and I will be there around lunchtime on Monday, if that's convenient."<br><br> "That's wonderful," Mary Turner said. "We'll never be able to thank you enough."<br><br> "We're glad to help," An'gel replied. "Now, there is one thing. We'd like to bring our ward, Benjy, with us, along with our dog and cat, Peanut and Endora. Will that be all right?"<br><br> "You bring whomever you want," Mary Turner said. "The more help, the better. I've heard that animals are especially sensitive to the supernatural."<br><br> "You and Sister," An'gel muttered. Then she spoke so Mary Turner could hear properly. "Thank you, my dear. Help is on the way."<br><br> "See you on Monday."<br><br> As An'gel laid the phone aside, she reflected that, by the end of the call, Mary Turner had a new note in her voice. She sounded hopeful, An'gel decided.<br><br> She was glad she'd managed to make Mary Turner feel better, but she wondered whether she and Dickce had committed themselves to solving a problem that would turn out to be more than they could handle. She figured a real live human being was playing tricks on the Catlins for some unknown purpose, but Cliffwood was an old house. Many sad and unpleasant things had happened there, particularly before, during, and right after the Civil War.<br><br> An'gel didn't believe in ghosts-not really-but there had been odd things that happened at Riverhill over the years. Doors closing on their own, the occasional cold spot in a room, small objects moved from their accustomed spots-nothing all that frightening, An'gel reflected, but odd. Definitely odd.<br><br> She and Dickce, along with Benjy, would have to keep their wits about them at Cliffwood, she decided. She wouldn't let odd things frighten her away.<br><br> The moment Dickce mentioned the word ghosts to Benjy, he grinned.<br><br> "Awesome." He looked down at the Labradoodle at his feet. "What do you think of that, Peanut? Are you ready to track down some ghosts?"<br><br> The dog gazed adoringly into the young man's face and barked twice. Benjy patted his head. "That means yes."<br><br> Dickce smiled and continued to stroke the Abyssinian she held in her arms. "What about you, Endora?"<br><br> The reddish-brown feline yawned and stretched, then began to purr.<br><br> "Sounds like they're both in," Benjy said. "How long do you think we'll be there?"<br><br> "I hope it won't take more than a week to get to the bottom of what's going on," Dickce replied.<br><br> A snort sounded from the direction of the stove. Dickce looked over to see the housekeeper, Clementine Sprayberry, arms folded over her chest, frowning at her.<br><br> "You and Miss An'gel don't need to go hunting ghosts anywhere," Clementine said. "Especially Natchez. I reckon you've heard how haunted it is. You're just asking for trouble if you go and stir things up."<br><br> "That's even more awesome." Benjy laughed. "A whole town that's haunted."<br><br> "You laugh all you want to," Clementine said. "I bet you'll be the first one out the door ten seconds after some horrible thing wakes you up in the middle of the night and tries to get you."<br><br> "What kind of horrible thing?" Dickce felt a chill at the conviction in the housekeeper's voice. She knew Clementine believed in spirits, and she herself had never made up her mind about them.<br><br> "No telling." Clementine shook her head. "Terrible things happened all over that town for three hundred years, and you don't know what might still be lurking."<br><br> Benjy's expression of amusement faded, Dickce noticed, in the face of Clementine's unrelenting certainty. He turned to Dickce. "How bad can it really be? I don't know anything about Natchez."<br><br> "There are a few books on Natchez in An'gel's study," Dickce said. "The town has a fascinating history, and you might want to do some reading before we go. Terrible things happened during the Civil War when the Union Army took over the town, and Natchez was a violent place in its early days. The books will give you all the details that I can't remember."<br><br> Benjy brightened. "Would Miss An'gel mind if I went in there right now to look for the books? If she's really busy, I don't want to disturb her."<br><br> "I'm sure she wouldn't mind, even if she is busy." Dickce knew her sister was as pleased about Benjy's interest in reading as she was. They had high hopes for him when he started Athena College the coming spring semester.<br><br> "Awesome." Benjy rose from his chair, his sang-froid seemingly restored. "Come on, Peanut, you know Miss An'gel always likes to see you." The dog loped after the young man as Benjy headed out of the kitchen.<br><br> "Whereas you, Missy," Dickce said to the cat still nestled in her arms, "are another story. An'gel can't get over the fact that you prefer me." She chuckled.<br><br> "Gracious, the way y'all talk to those animals." Clementine laughed.<br><br> Dickce shot the housekeeper a pointed glance. "I've heard you talk to them both plenty of times yourself."<br><br> "Well, I reckon so." Clementine turned her attention back to the stove and picked the lid up from a pot of chicken and dumplings. "If y'all are going to treat 'em like people, I guess there's no reason I shouldn't do it, too." She stirred the pot for a moment. "Lunch is just about ready. Ten more minutes."<br><br> Dickce sniffed appreciatively. "The perfect thing for a cool fall day."<br><br> Clementine looked up from the stove. "Miss Dickce, y'all ever told Benjy about the things that go on here sometimes?"<br><br> Dickce stiffened, and Endora squeaked a protest. Dickce forced herself to relax. "What do mean, the things that go on here?"<br><br> "You know what I mean," Clementine said. "Doors closing all by themselves, things moving around after I've dusted, and you know I know to put things right back in the exact same place they've been the last hundred years." She sniffed. "Unless you and Miss An'gel are going around behind my back, trying to play tricks on me, you know ain't no earthly thing doing that."<br><br> "An'gel and I would certainly never play that kind of trick on you, and you know it." Dickce shook her head at the housekeeper. "I don't have any better explanation for it than you do, and to answer your original question, no, I haven't said anything to Benjy. I don't imagine An'gel has either. Since he has his own quarters above the garage, he probably might not ever notice anything here in the house."<br><br> "Maybe so." Clementine focused her attention on the stove again. "Still, y'all might better tell that boy, 'specially before y'all go hunting spirits in Natchez."<br><br> "You might be right. I'll discuss it with An'gel." Dickce set the cat on the floor. "Come on, Endora. After I wash my hands, we're going to set the table." To her amusement, the cat, after a yawn and a stretch, padded after her to the powder room under the stairs and waited until Dickce finished her ablutions.<br><br> While Dickce set the table, Endora sat in the doorway and watched. After a couple of minutes, apparently bored, she disappeared down the hall. Dickce figured she had gone in search of Peanut and Benjy.<br><br> Dickce performed her task without giving much thought to what she was doing. Her thoughts focused on the upcoming trip to Natchez, and their reason for going. She hated to admit it-and she doubted she would admit it to An'gel-but Clementine's dire warning had spooked her a little. As had the housekeeper's reminder about the occasional unsettling experience here at Riverhill. She and An'gel really should tell Benjy, she decided. He ought to know, because someday he would most likely be the owner of the house, since she and An'gel had no blood descendants to inherit from them.<br><br> The last piece of cutlery in place, Dickce gazed at the table. Had she forgotten anything?<br><br> "Looks fine to me," she murmured.<br><br> As she continued to think about the housekeeper's words, Dickce felt a prickle on the back of her neck.<br><br> What if Clementine is right? What if we stir up something in that house we can't handle?<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> Benjy braked the car gently to a halt, shifted into Park, and switched off the ignition. His shoulders ached lightly from the long drive, as did his head, but he figured a little pain was a small price to pay for having arrived at Cliffwood in one piece. Miss Dickce had pouted for a few minutes when Miss An'gel asked him to drive them all the way to Natchez. Miss An'gel refused to budge over her sister's protests. Miss Dickce acted like a good sport and hadn't sulked for long.<br><br> If Miss Dickce had driven them, Benjy reckoned, she would have received several tickets coming down the Natchez Trace. The speed limit was only fifty miles an hour, and Miss Dickce had trouble driving less than eighty no matter where she was going. He enjoyed the more leisurely pace because it afforded him the opportunity to appreciate the hues of the fall foliage-rich golds and yellows, vibrant reds, browns, and greens. Where he grew up in Southern California, there was nothing like this panoply of autumn colors.</p><h2>Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right</h2><p><p><b>Harness the power of a nutrient-rich diet to ensure a lifetime free of illness and full of health!</b></p><p>In his private practice, Joel Fuhrman, M.D. helps families transform their eating habits and recover their health.

These beloved creators of countless children's favorites outdo themselves with this 1963 Caldecott Honor-winning classic about a little girl in need of assistance. Finding a birthday present for her mother is no easy task for our heroine. Luckily, she happens upon the avuncular Mr. Rabbit, whose heart is in the right place, even if he doesn't always have the best ideas. Ultimately, his suggestions do come in handy, and between the two of them they determine the ideal birthday tribute: the gift of color. Children will join the protagonists in contemplating how to make the abstract tangible, and all readers will be delighted to see yellow translate to bananas, as green is given in pears, and blue takes the shape of grapes. <p>The soft, muted colors of Sendak's illustrations are reminiscent of a Monet landscape--utterly appealing and dreamy. And the reflective, sing-song dialogue between Mr. Rabbit and the girl is as deliciously lulling as a shady swing in a hammock. This quiet, peaceful book is a treasure for any shelf. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>The heroine of their book has a problem. And at first it does not look as though Mr. Rabbit is going to be much help in solving it. For everyone knows you cannot give your mother a red roof, a yellow taxi-cab, a green caterpillar, or a blue lake for her birthday. But then all the little girl had said was that her mother liked red, yellow, green, and blue--and so Mr. Rabbit was trying.</p><h2>The Villages of England Notebook</h2><p><p>Brian Cook's illustrations of Britain, its cottages, churches, villages, and landscapes, are now iconic and highlight the best of Britain.

And it sends us on a lifelong search for answers, both to the practical questions and the deepest question of all: Why? In this definitive guide book, Michael F. Myers, MD, a leading psychiatrist, and Carla Fine, author of the acclaimed <b>No Time to Say Goodbye: Surviving the Suicide of a Loved One</b>, combine their perspectives as a physician and a survivor to offer compassionate and practical advice to anyone affected by suicide.</p><p><b>Advance Praise for <i>Touched by Suicide</i>:</b><br> "Each year suicide claims tens of thousands of lives, but its victims extend far beyond the annual statistical sum. It is the living, those loved ones left behind to answer the unanswerable and move on with life, who surely are the victims as well. To them, <i>Touched by Suicide</i> will prove a resource of very great worth."<br> &#x2014;Gordon H. Smith, United States Senator <br><br> "A rich resource of guidance and support written by survivors with candor and compassion intended for those who have been touched by suicide. This book will be invaluable for those who must face the tragedy of suicide in their lives and those who are in a position to support the healing journey of survivors."<br> &#x2014;Jerry Reed, Executive Director, Suicide Prevention Action Network (SPAN USA) <br><br> "This is a remarkable step-by-step manual for living through the profound chaos that suicide leaves in its wake. This compelling, comprehensive, and inspirational book is written not just for survivors, but for all of us who strive to understand and prevent suicide. .. This is a worthy contribution to the literature of suicide and survival."<br> &#x2014;Morton M. Silverman, M.D., Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry, The University of Chicago; Editor-in-Chief, <i>Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior</i> <br><br> "<i>Touched by Suicide</i> is a floodlit pathway for those tragically thrust into the dark forest of having to survive a loved one&#x2019;s suicide. It is loaded with straight talk and practical insights, compassion and understanding. Myers and Fine deftly meld their personal and professional experiences, aided by compelling first-person accounts, to translate unfathomable pain into hope.

Across the Wide Missouri tells the compelling story of the climax and decline of the Rocky Mountain fur trade during the 1830s. More than a history, it portrays the mountain fur trade as a way of business and a way of life, vividly illustrating how it shaped the expansion of the American West.</p><p>Like many U.S. historians, cultural critic Bernard DeVoto believed that the American character was rooted in the experience of westward expansion. Unlike those who championed the civilizing graces of the agrarian frontier, however, DeVoto drew inspiration from the mercenary, imperial designs of the fur trade. Originally published in 1947, <i>Across the Wide Missouri</i>is arguably the best known of his studies in American history, examining the rise and fall of the U.S. fur dynasties in the 1830s. The book chronicles the competition between John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, an "opposition" group of trappers (including Jim Bridger and Kit Carson) descended from the earlier entrepreneurial activities of General William H. Ashley. Devoto specifically narrates the major expeditions and the daily experiences of the Western divisions of these companies, which scoured the northernmost regions of the Rocky Mountains for beaver. He contends that, by exploring the recently charted Northern plateau, fighting off interlopers, and setting up trade networks, the loose confederation of trappers, traders, and Native Americans shaped the materialism that typifies modern American society. In his densely detailed description of the company "rendezvous," DeVoto shows how the activities of trading, partying, and resource pooling created a shared experience for competing cultural and economic parties on the frontier. While the centrality of the fur trade in the development of the American character may strike some readers as overemphasized, DeVoto's thesis still carries much relevance for modern American studies. <i>--John M. Anderson</i>Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a renowned scholar-historian of the American West and one of the country&#39;s greatest men of letters.</p><h2>Murder Game (GhostWalkers, Book 7)</h2><p><b>Be seduced by the world of the GhostWalkers as #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author ChristineFeehan raises the stakes in the ultimate game of love and death...</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Games should be fun, but for two expert teams across the country, they&#x2019;re murder&#x2014;because the winning team is the one that gets the most kills.

Here we are, boxed in between this wall of eighteen wheelers on our left and right, in front and behind, in this little pocket of flying road, racing down I-95 at seventy-six miles an hour. My daughters are asleep beside me and in the backseat. I don&#x2019;t care that it&#x2019;s pouring rain. I don&#x2019;t care that it&#x2019;s dark. On another night, I would be terrified out of my skin by the blasting of horns. But not tonight. Let me tell you something. These trucks are like huge guardian angels rushing us to safety and the rain is washing us clean. Life has been a little rough around the edges and it was time to break out. Yeah. A little rough would be one way of understating it.</p><p>Oh, eventually you&#x2019;ll hear the whole story, because this is a long ride and there ain&#x2019;t much to do besides tell secrets and think about life. Thinking about life is what I had been doing for one very long time. I finally decided to quit the thinking nonsense and do something. I mean, I was even driving myself crazy from my own whining. Then I came to this conclusion. You don&#x2019;t like your life? Go get another one and shut the heck up already, right?</p><p>Look, I know I&#x2019;m not the only single parent in the world. And I know I&#x2019;m not the only one who&#x2019;s tight for money all the time, okay? And, I might not be the biggest gambler you ever met, but I know when it&#x2019;s time to change the scenery and if you don&#x2019;t do it when you feel the urge, you might be blowing off the last life raft that ever floats your way. It&#x2019;s probably worth noting that I waited to change the scenery until I went digging for my mascara in Gracie&#x2019;s makeup bag (my fifteen year-old daughter, thank you), and I found birth control pills, some other unidentifiable pills, and a baggie of pot. Then, I hemmed and hawed around until I found Lindsey weeping over her weight&#x2014;she&#x2019;s five feet five inches tall and weighs one hundred and twenty pounds, the same as Gracie. She doesn&#x2019;t even have a freckle. Her date for the prom told her he couldn&#x2019;t go with her, that she was too fat. She was standing naked in front of the full-length mirror, sobbing and reading Sylvia Plath aloud&#x2014;remember her? She&#x2019;s the poet who stuck her head in the oven and killed herself. The final straw was the romantic dinner I had with Louie Provost at Epernay when his wife, Cherry, showed up to introduce herself. Um, didn&#x2019;t know there was a wife? Thanks, Louie. Can&#x2019;t have dinner there anymore.</p><p>I said to myself, Linda? You can definitely do better than this. All of a sudden it was clear to me that I had a stupid job and we had a very stupid life. So I called my sister and she said, Honey chile? You put yourself and your girls in your car and come on down to me!</p><p>So, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing out here in the middle of the night in Virginia, traveling under the wing of all these trucks. But can you keep a secret? I quit my job. We&#x2019;re moving to Mount Pleasant and no one knows it except you and me. I know it seems slightly sneaky and a little impetuous but you know what? It&#x2019;s not. Look, if New Jersey has wanted us, it would have given us a reason to stay. It didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I have to find a job. And that, my friend, should be the easiest part. I could get hired as a grave digger and make myself believe that I was working at Mardi Gras. But hey, brighter days and better days are coming. I can feel it in my bones! I really can. I am absolutely going to make this work.</p><p></p><p>Prologue</p><p>My mother always used to say that if a man could count his real friends on just one hand that he was a wealthy man indeed. My mother was right. I&#x2019;m going to tell you a story about heaven and hell and how I got out of one and found the other&#x2014;both with the help of a true-blue friend. Hell was being married to Loretta and working for her father. Heaven is our restaurant on Shem Creek, which we would never have had, except for the generosity and ingenuity of my best friend and partner, Robert. We call it Jackson Hole because my last name is Jackson and I guess you can say it is a hole in the wall. Yeah, it&#x2019;s definitely a hole in the wall. And, Robert like to ski guess where. I know. It&#x2019;s a less than nimble play on words, but let&#x2019;s get this on the record right now&#x2014;when the whole world conspires against you, a healthy sense of humor can be a very valuable tool. And, up until eight months ago, the world conspired. Worse, I was thrashing around in my quagmire of self-deception watching it happen and didn&#x2019;t do a thing about it.</p><p>I used to come down here all the time, in between deals, and I guess I&#x2019;ve been fishing the waters around Charleston for fifteen years. There isn&#x2019;t a creek in this whole area that hasn&#x2019;t seen the bottom of my boat, but that said, every time I dropped a hook in the salty creeks and rivets, it always seemed like the first time. The landscape and the light&#x2014;well, it was always a little different. Quiet but vibrant. You could have made yourself believe that the good Lord Himself was somewhere in the thicket, waiting patiently for you to remember that He was still there. It finally got to the point where I just left my boat in South Carolina. And my heart? Well, looking back, it seems now that the only time I ever thought about it was when I was floating on the Lowcountry waters.</p><p>We should discuss this heaven and hell thing, which all begins with my newly-acquired-at-great-personal-loss philosophy. Here it is in a nutshell. When you choose the wrong partner at the dance (whether it&#x2019;s marriage or profession), you will surely bust you ass.</p><p>Women seem to know this by instinct. Men don&#x2019;t. men are conditioned from birth to be providers and basically, our success is measured by how well we do that job. This somehow neatly translates to how much we earn and how many trophies we can accumulate over a lifetime. Cars, second houses, antiques, jewelry for the wife...;this list goes on and on. We have to graduate from the rights schools, become a partner in the right firm, marry the right girl, be invited to join the right club and develop a decent game of golf and tennis.</p><p>Right? Wrong! That entire unholy plan, my friends, is a truckload of manure.</p><p>Isn&#x2019;t it? I swear, I laugh now when I think about the years I spent chasing the almighty buck. Money, money, money. And, chasing the almighty buck with my wife, Loretta, who always was and continues to be a misery. Well, I can laugh now, but a few months ago, it was not funny at all.</p><p>Overall, daughters are so much luckier than sons. Their mothers tell them to follow their hearts, right? They say, Darlin&#x2019;? If you want to go study history, you go right ahead. Honey? If you want to be a chemist, go right ahead! Sure enough, women will graduate and can usually earn a decent living with their degree, doing something they love. Of course, women get screwed left and right because they don&#x2019;t earn the same money that their male colleagues do for performing the same jobs and for a whole variety of other reasons, but for the most part, I think women are happier in their professional lives. And yes, I guess you could say that I am kind of a male feminist.</p><p>But, sons are another matter entirely. When I look at the number of kids coming out of graduate school with business degrees, I am absolutely astonished. I mean, where are they all going to find the fortunes that they think are waiting for them? The ones they think they are entitled to? And law school? Don&#x2019;t get me started! Do we really need more lawyers?</p><p>What has happened to humanity is this. The world has become vicious, because the devil&#x2019;s real name is greed. Our ability to justify our greed is staggering. If you believe what you read, see and hear around you, our children&#x2019;s future will be all about heeding the call and joining the detestable clamor for money and power. It breaks your heart.</p><p>When I think about how I used to run my life, I am sure I must have been completely out of my mind. Besides working seventy-hour weeks, I used to read three newspapers every day&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. No more. Now I read the front page of the Post &amp; Courier and guess what? It&#x2019;s as much as I want to know about what&#x2019;s going on &#x201c;out there&#x201d;. And, I check the weather and the tide tables.</p><p>Let me ask you something. Have you ever been to Italy? Did you know that Italy has the sixth largest economy in the world? But when you go there, you see shops closed for hours in the middle of the day, everyone seems to be drinking wine and espresso, smoking Marlboro Reds, and it looks like no one&#x2019;s working! What is going on in Italy? Ahen. They are really living. And, guess what? Their lives last just as long as ours do. But! They&#x2019;re enjoying their lives one helluva lost more than we are. So, I said to myself, Brad? One day, you&#x2019;re gonna be dead and buried. That&#x2019;s when I decided to become Italian.</p><p>I want to have a romance with life! I want to love women and children and savor all the beauty and good to be found in the world. I was missing everything. So hitting rock bottom was a good thing. Otherwise, I&#x2019;d still be a hamster, running on a worthless, pointless wheel, racing to the grave.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Brad? Your appointment is here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll be right there. Thanks!&#x201d;</p><p>That was Louise Waring. Who&#x2019;s she? Well, Louise is the greatest woman in the world, that&#x2019;s all. She runs the kitchen, everybody and everything. She&#x2019;s the chef when Duane takes days off, and the assistant chef when he&#x2019;s here. She is capable of almost anything, thank God. Shoot, just last week she stopped a knife fight in the kitchen between a busboy and a dishwasher. Seems one guy made a slanderous remark about the dubious nature of the other&#x2019;s birth, which was followed by a reference to the other fellow&#x2019;s lewd preference for his mother. Well, after that, the conversation switched to Spanish and could have escalated to life-threatening situation, but Louise stepped in and threatened to call the police. It&#x2019;s a good thing our customers don&#x2019;t know what goes on in the kitchen. It&#x2019;s bad enough what goes on in the dining room!</p><p>Rock bottom? It&#x2019;s almost embarrassing to tell you how I got there, but I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it a lot. I figure that if I can save some other poor son of a gun from the hell I went through then it&#x2019;s worth it to put my pride aside. No, I&#x2019;ve come to some very new conclusions and it all began with becoming separated from Loretta and going broke. I was forty-two, a smart fellow (or so I thought) with a platinum resume and suddenly I didn&#x2019;t have a pot to pee in or a window to throw it out of, like my grandfather used to say. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.</p><p>Look, you&#x2019;ll have to excuse me for just a few minutes. This interview shouldn&#x2019;t take very long. And, when I get back, I&#x2019;ll tell you why simplifying life is such a beautiful thing. Yep, think like an Indian and keep it simple. Just hold that thought.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Second-Worst Restaurant in France: A Paul Stuart Novel (2) (Paul Stuart Series)</h2><p><b><b>In this delightful sequel to the best-selling comedic novel <i>My Italian Bulldozer</i>, Paul Stuart's travels take him to a French village, where the local restaurant's haute cuisine leaves a lot to be desired.</b></b><br><br>Renowned Scottish cookbook writer Paul Stuart is hard at work on his new book, <i>The Philosophy of Food, </i>but complicated domestic circumstances, and two clingy cats, are making that difficult.<br><br>So when Paul's eccentric cousin Chloe suggests that he join her at the house she's rented in the French countryside, he jumps at the chance.

His works have been translated into more than forty languages and have been best sellers throughout the world. He lives in Scotland.<b><i>1 </i></b><br><b><i> Remarkable Cousin Chloe </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> It was one of Paul Stuart&#x2019;s friends who said to him, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stress this enough, you know: breathing is important. Really important.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d already worked that out,&#x201d; Paul replied. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, I know it sounds obvious . . .&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>It does, </i>thought Paul. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But people forget. And they just breathe&#x2014;you know, like this.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Paul waited. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whereas,&#x201d; his friend continued, &#x201c;you should breathe like this.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>In, out . . . </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought I already was,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;In, out. Like that?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Deeper. And hold the breath in for a while. Like this.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> There was silence. Then the friend said, &#x201c;And while you hold it in, think. That&#x2019;s the important thing. Concentrate your thoughts. Think of the <i>present, </i>Paul. The right now. The actual.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good. You need to be mindful, Paul. Mindful. In. Think. Out. Still thinking.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> And he should also close his eyes from time to time, the friend said, and think about where he was and what he was doing, rather than about where he was going to be, and what he was going to be doing. And it was for this reason then that Paul, well-known food writer, celebrated cook, and a kind but slightly accident-prone man, now closed his eyes and took a deep breath.<br> &nbsp;<br> He smelled coffee, and this was, he thought, a mindful sort of smell. In front of him, in the real world, was a freshly made, piping-hot cup of Brazilian coffee, its aroma drifting up to him on little wisps of steam. He loved the smell of that; a dark smell, a chocolate smell, but without chocolate&#x2019;s note of sweetness. The smell of coffee, really; that, he decided, was the way he would describe it. He opened his eyes and gazed out of the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> He thought&#x2014;as he took a deep breath&#x2014;<i>Should I go? </i>He knew that was not mindful. He needed to think again, not about what he should do in the future, but about what he was doing now. But still the same question came back. <i>Should I go to France? Should I call Chloe right now and tell her: no France?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> He exhaled. He could still smell the coffee, which was now.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> It was late spring in Scotland and life was undoubtedly good&#x2014;as was the view. From where he was sitting, in the kitchen of his flat, Paul could see in the distance, kissed by sunlight, the castle that dominated the city. Beneath it, the roofs and spires of the Old Town, with, here and there, those odd architectural spikes for which Edinburgh was so well known, sticking up as if to proclaim Scotland&#x2019;s ancient motto <i>Nemo me impune lacessit&#x2014;Nobody challenges me with impunity. </i>Spikes placed on the tops of buildings, prickly thistles, the sharp-tipped antlers of Highland deer: these all played a major part in the iconography of Scotland, Paul thought; but so did the hills, those gentle, feminine hills; so did the waterfalls, and the light, and the cold blue sea; so did this city, that was like an opera set, on which at any moment somebody might fling open a window and start to sing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul lived&#x2014;in a part-time way, as he put it&#x2014;with his girl�friend, Gloria, who was also the editor of his books, and with her two Siamese cats. It was living with somebody in a part-time way because Gloria kept her own flat on the other side of town, and still spent much of the day there. That was where her office was, where her mail was delivered, and where most of her clothes&#x2014;a disorganised wardrobe, a riot of colour&#x2014;were kept. It would have been easier, of course, if they had co-habited fully, but Gloria simply could not face sorting out the detritus of the years she had spent in that particular flat. It was just all too complicated; much sim�pler to leave things as they were. Besides, the arrangement gave both of them space, and space, she felt, was what every relationship&#x2014;with anyone at all&#x2014;required.<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul and Gloria got on well. It had never been one of those passionate affairs, in which two people, in mutual intoxication, filled their waking moments with thoughts of one another. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like that, with us,&#x201d; Gloria had said to a friend. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s different with Paul; it really is. We&#x2019;re not like two love-struck kids, gazing into one another&#x2019;s eyes. We&#x2019;re . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mature adults?&#x201d; supplied her friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; said the friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had its moments, though, and neither Paul or Gloria wanted or expected much more out of it. They were friends, as well as lovers, and that, they had both decided, was a good state to be in. To be a lover was easy enough; to be a friend required rather more. To be both was something not given to everyone. <br> &nbsp;<br> There were disagreements, though&#x2014;areas where a differ�ent view was taken of something that might not have been of great importance in itself, but was capable of disturbing the otherwise tranquil waters of their domestic relationship. Such as cats, and it was of these cats that Paul was thinking as he looked out from his kitchen window that morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria was the owner of two Siamese cats, Hamish and Mrs. Macdonald. They were sleek, self-satisfied creatures, cut�tingly arrogant and effortlessly handsome in a way in which lesser cats were not. They had light blue eyes that stared at you with a somewhat off-putting intensity. They had silky coats of a shade that a Belgian chocolatier might have taken years to perfect. They were vocal in a way that only Siamese cats can be, voicing their opinion in long-drawn-out cat-sounds that seemed to demand an instant response. They had sev�eral recognisable yowls: what Paul called an <i>asking yowl; </i>what he described as a <i>complaining yowl; </i>and finally, and more seri�ously, a <i>warning yowl. </i>The cats lived in Gloria&#x2019;s flat, amongst the books, papers, and colourful clothing. They had cat beds hooked onto radiators, and timed, battery-operated cat feed�ers that opened at set hours to reveal supplies of salmon and tuna within. They had everything, it seemed to Paul, that any cat could possibly want. And yet they always seemed to expect more. These cats, he said to himself, would never understand the virtue of moderation. <i>Do not want too much </i>did not apply to cats.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How fond are you of those cats of yours?&#x201d; he asked Glo�ria one evening.<br> &nbsp;<br> This brought a surprised response. &#x201c;What a question. Really, Paul! It&#x2019;s like asking a parent if she likes her children . . . or almost.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul did his best to explain. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t take this the wrong way, but those cats seem almost indifferent to you&#x2014;or so it seems to me. The way they look at you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He now realised just how far he had strayed into sensi�tive territory. &#x201c;Indifferent?&#x201d; said Gloria, her tone now one of decided reproof. &#x201c;Hamish and Mrs. Macdonald are <i>not </i>indif�ferent to me. How could you say such a thing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, it&#x2019;s just the way they . . . Maybe that&#x2019;s the way cats are. I don&#x2019;t know much about these creatures&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Again, he was cut short. &#x201c;Hamish and Mrs. Macdonald are both very fond of me,&#x201d; said Gloria firmly. &#x201c;In fact, they love me&#x2014;actually love me.&#x201d; She intercepted Paul&#x2019;s look of incre�dulity. &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t be cynical. I&#x2019;m absolutely sure of that. In fact, I positively bask in the love of my cats.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul had thought she might be speaking ironically, but now realised his mistake. Discretion might have prompted him to leave the matter there, but he persisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure that cats love humans,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;Dogs do, of course.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria shook her head. &#x201c;Dogs . . . ,&#x201d; she began.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right then, dogs,&#x201d; Paul interjected. &#x201c;How about dogs? Dogs will sacrifice their lives for their owners, if necessary. You know how it is&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll jump into rivers to save a drown�ing child, tackle an armed burglar, that sort of thing. Whereas cats . . .&#x201d; He looked up at the ceiling. &#x201c;Is there any recorded instance of a cat doing anything unselfish? Feline altruism?&#x201d; This, he felt, was the clinching argument. &#x201c;An oxymoron?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria stared at him reproachfully.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You see,&#x201d; Paul went on, &#x201c;I have a theory that cats are per�fect psychopaths.&#x201d; He had just thought of it, but it seemed to make sense.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria looked doubtful. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re making this up, Paul.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He smiled. She was right&#x2014;but so, he felt, was his theory. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you want to understand the psychopathic personality, look at a cat. They never experience guilt&#x2014;unlike dogs, who look so guilty if they do anything wrong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria sniffed. &#x201c;It might be that you don&#x2019;t understand cats, Paul. Cats are not . . .&#x201d; She searched for the right word. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not <i>obvious.</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Obvious?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. You mentioned dogs, so let&#x2019;s go back to them. They wear their hearts on their sleeves. All that grinning and bark�ing and slobbering.&#x201d; She gave a shudder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whereas cats?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria was in no doubt. &#x201c;Cats are effortlessly cool. Cats, one might say, have <i>it.</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul knew that <i>it </i>existed, but was uncertain as to what <i>it </i>was. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re going to have to disagree,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps the world is divided into dog and cat factions, just as it is into those who like chocolate and those who like strawberries.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria laughed. &#x201c;Really? There are many&#x2014;millions, I suspect&#x2014;who adore both chocolates <i>and </i>strawberries. There are people who eat those strawberries covered with chocolate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul thought about the taste wheel in one of his kitchen encyclopaedias; chocolate was earthy while strawberries were fruity, and he was sure that they were on different segments of the wheel. &#x201c;Let me tell you, Gloria, strawberry and choco�late do <i>not </i>go together. They just don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, they do,&#x201d; said Gloria. &#x201c;I like them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t argue,&#x201d; said Paul.<br> &nbsp;<br> She brightened. &#x201c;Which reminds me . . . Taste, aesthet�ics, philosophy . . . The offer for the new book: Have you decided yet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As Paul&#x2019;s freelance editor, Gloria&#x2019;s job was to edit the highly successful books that he wrote on a wide range of culinary subjects. She had nothing to do with contractual matters, but she had an obvious interest in his keeping up the sup-ply of the manuscripts she would read and knock into shape. Paul wrote well but tended to use long sentences that Gloria would have to chop into two, or sometimes even three, parts. She also arranged his illustrations, consulting picture librar-ians or engaging food photographers to ensure that Paul&#x2019;s reputation for lusciously presented books be preserved. Paul was happy to abandon the subject of cats. He felt that he had somehow argued himself into an unwanted corner. He was not anti- cat&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;he was just being realistic about them. Cats were fine, but there was no getting away from their fundamental attitude. That was it, he thought: cats had <i>attitude, </i>whereas dogs . . . He stopped himself. It was time to address the offer for the new book. He found that it was unnecessary to think for very long. Of course, he would accept. It was an extremely generous offer by any standards, the only drawback being that they wanted him to have the book ready within six months. Yet that was not impossible: he had already worked out what he wanted to say, and it would be refreshing to move away from his usual series&#x2014;<i>Paul Stuart&#x2019;s Tuscan Table </i>being the latest title&#x2014;and deal with something as broad and exciting as the philosophy of food. Paul had taken a philosophy course at university, but it was an introductory course that had spent far too much time on Hume, he felt, and had left many other philosophers untouched. Yet there was a clear role for the enthusiastic amateur, presumably even in philosophy, which was, after all, about things of concern to ordinary people as much as to experts. If he were to write about the philosophy of food it would be a personal statement, written from the heart as much as from the mind. The writing of it would not be a chore; rather, it would be a celebration, a meditation, an act of homage to a subject&#x2014;food and its preparation&#x2014;that had engaged him from the age of twelve. Unlike some of the chefs he wrote about, Paul was modest, but he felt that this book would be a good one. All he had to do, of course, was to write it.</p><h2>Birds of America: Stories</h2><p>A long-awaited collection of stories--twelve in all--by one of the most exciting writers at work today, the acclaimed author of <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> and <i>Self-Help.</i> Stories remarkable in their range, emotional force, and dark laughter, and in the sheer beauty and power of their language.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the opening story, "Willing"--about a second-rate movie actress in her thirties who has moved back to Chicago, where she makes a seedy motel room her home and becomes involved with a mechanic who has not the least idea of who she is as a human being--<i>Birds of America</i> unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the unhinged, the lost, the unsettled of our America. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the story "Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People" ("There is nothing as complex in the world--no flower or stone--as a single hello from a human being"), a woman newly separated from her husband is on a long-planned trip through Ireland with her mother. When they set out on an expedition to kiss the Blarney Stone, the image of wisdom and success that her mother has always put forth slips away to reveal the panicky woman she really is. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In "Charades," a family game at Christmas is transformed into a hilarious and insightful (and fundamentally upsetting) revelation of crumbling family ties. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In "Community Life,"a shy, almost reclusive, librarian, Transylvania-born and Vermont-bred, moves in with her boyfriend, the local anarchist in a small university town, and all hell breaks loose. And in "Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens," a woman who goes through the stages of grief as she mourns the death of her cat (Anger, Denial, Bargaining, H�agen Dazs, Rage) is seen by her friends as really mourning other issues: the impending death of her parents, the son she never had, Bosnia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what may be her most stunning book yet, Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal, the idiosyncratic and the mundane, with all the wit, brio, and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.</p><p>Lorrie Moore made her debut in 1985 with <i>Self-Help</i>, which proved that she could write about sadness, sex, and the single girl with as much tenderness--and with considerably more wit--than almost any of her contemporaries. She followed this story collection with another, <i>Like Life</i>, as well as two fine novels, <i>Anagrams</i> and <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> Yet Moore's rapid-fire alternation of mirth and deep melancholy is so perfectly suited to the short form that readers will greet <i>Birds of America</i> with an audible sigh of relief--and delight. In "Willing," for example, a second-rate Hollywood starlet retreats into a first-rate depression, taking shelter in a Chicago-area Days Inn. The author's eye for the small comic detail is intact: her juice-bar-loving heroine initially drowns her sorrows in "places called I Love Juicy or Orange-U-Sweet." Yet Moore seldom satisfies herself with mere pop-cultural mockery. She's too interested in the small and large devastations of life, which her actress is experiencing in spades. "Walter leaned her against his parked car," Moore relates. "His mouth was slightly lopsided, paisley-shaped, his lips anneloid and full, and he kissed her hard. There was something numb and on hold in her. There were small dark pits of annihilation she discovered in her heart, in the loosening fist of it, and she threw herself into them, falling." Elsewhere, the author serves up a similar mixture of one-liners and contemporary grief, lamenting the death of a housecat in "Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens" and the death of a marriage in "Which Is More Than I Can Say About That." And her hilarious account of a nuclear family undergoing a meltdown in "Charades" will make you want to avoid parlor games for the rest of your natural life. <i>--James Marcus</i>"Lorrie Moore soars with <i>Birds of America</i>...a marvelous, fiercely funny book." --Jeff Giles, <i>Newsweek</i><p> "Fluid, cracked, mordant, colloquial, Moore's sentences hold, even startle.... Her most potent work so far...[it] will stand by itself as one of our funniest, most telling anatomies of human love and vulnerability." --James McManus, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "A marvelous collection, deeper than anything Moore has written and yet underscored by that trademark humor in the face of familiar awfulness. Her stories are tough, lean, funny, and metaphysical.... Birds of America has about it a wild beauty that simply makes one feel more connected to life." --Gail Caldwell, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p> "At once sad, funny, lyrical and prickly, <i>Birds of America</i> attests to the deepening emotional chiaroscuro of her wise and beguiling work." --Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>The Kingfisher History Encyclopedia</h2><p>Packed with intriguing facts and invaluable information, this fully revised and updated edition is the key to the past.

The boys live in a gang-plagued war zone on Chicago's West Side, literally learning how to dodge bullets the way kids in the suburbs learn to chase baseballs. "If I grow up, I'd like to be a bus driver," says Lafeyette at one point. That's <i>if</i>, not <i>when</i>--spoken with the complete innocence of a child. The book's title comes from a comment made by the brothers' mother as she and author Alex Kotlowitz contemplate the challenges of living in such a hostile environment: "There are no children here," she says. "They've seen too much to be children." This book humanizes the problem of inner-city pathology, makes readers care about Lafeyette and Pharoah more than they may expect to, and offers a sliver of hope buried deep within a world of chaos.The best-selling, heartbreaking yet inspiring story of two young brothers in Chicago&#39;s inner city--a searing look at the other America, where drugs, despair, and death are challenged daily by the resilient courage of youth.</p><h2>The Gift of the Magi</h2><p>A husband and wife sacrifice treasured possessions in order to buy each other Christmas presents.</p><p>Born William Sydney Porter in 1862, O.

Henry's classic story has been embellished in this adaptation performed by the St. Charles Players. In this production, Della is rummaging through the attic on a Christmas Eve with her granddaughter. This brings back memories of a Christmas Eve many years before, and she tells the story of how she and Jim Dillingham met and courted, leading to the story we know so well. All of the performers in this work are splendid. Della, young and not so young, is vivacious and full of spunk. Jim is a confident, ambitious young man who is smitten by Della. Granddaughter cannot get enough of the story. While not faithful to the story in many respects (the setting, for example), this delightful and entertaining production is faithful to its spirit.

I shall recount thirteen and a half of them in this book but keep quiet about the rest," says the narrator of Walter Moers&#x2019;s epic adventure. "What about the Minipirates? What about the Hobgoblins, the Spiderwitch, the Babbling Billows, the Troglotroll, the Mountain Maggot...Mine is a tale of mortal danger and eternal love, of hair&#x2019;s breadth, last-minute escapes." Welcome to the fantastic world of Zamonia, populated by all manner of extraordinary characters. It&#x2019;s a land of imaginative lunacy and supreme adventure, wicked satire and epic fantasy, all mixed together, turned on its head, and lavishly illustrated by the author.</p><p>A cult-classic wherever it has been published, the epic adventure of fantasy, science fiction, myth, and fairy-tale about a bluebear with 27 lives.Captain Bluebear is a bear with blue fur, a creature as unique as the fantastic adventures he undergoes. Unlike cats, which have only nine lives, bluebears have twenty-seven. This is fortunate, because our hero is forever avoiding disaster by a paw&#39;s breadth. In this remarkable book, Captain Bluebear tells the story of his first thirteen-and-a-half lives spent on the mysterious continent of Zamonia, where intelligence is an infectious disease and water flows uphill, where headless giants roam deserts made of sugar, and where only Captain Bluebear&#39;s courage and ingenuity enable him to escape the dangers that lie in wait for him around every corner. In company with our indomitable hero, we enter a realm of the imagination that combines the fantasy of &#34;Lord of the Rings and &#34;The Neverending Story with the humour of Baron Munchausen - a wonderland where anything can exist except boredom.</p><h2>Dorothy Day: The World Will Be Saved by Beauty: An Intimate Portrait of My Grandmother</h2><p>The life and work of Dorothy Day&#x2014;the iconic, celebrated, and controversial Catholic whom Pope Francis called a &#x201c;great American&#x201d;&#x2014;told with illuminating detail by her granddaughter.<br><br>Dorothy Day (1897-1980) was a prominent Catholic, writer, social activist, and co-founder of a movement dedicated to serving the poorest of the poor. Her life has been revealed through her own writings as well as the work of historians, theologians, and academics. What has been missing until now is a more personal account from the point of view of someone who knew her well. <i>Dorothy Day:</i> <i>The World Will Be Saved by Beauty </i>is a frank and reflective, heartfelt and humorous portrayal as written by her granddaughter, Kate Hennessy.<br> <br><i>Dorothy Day: The World Will Be Saved by Beauty </i>challenges ideas of plaster saints and of saintly women. Day is an unusual candidate for sainthood. Before her conversion, she lived what she called a &#x201c;disorderly life,&#x201d; during which she had an abortion and then gave birth to a child out of wedlock. After her conversion, she was both an obedient servant and a rigorous challenger of the Church. She was a prolific writer whose books are still in print and widely read. While tenderly rendered, this account will show her as driven to do good but dogmatic, loving but judgmental, in particular with regards to her only daughter, Tamar. She was also full of humor and laughter, and could light up any room she entered.<br> <br>An undisputed radical heroine, called &#x201c;a saint for the occupy era&#x201d; by <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i>, Day&#x2019;s story unfolds against a backdrop of New York City from the 1910s to the 1980s and world events spanning from World War I to Vietnam.

The first lady appeared one day unannounced, behind the wheel of her car, her secretary and a Secret Service agent her passengers. To Murray, then aged twenty-three, Roosevelt&#x2019;s self-assurance was a symbol of women&#x2019;s independence, a symbol that endured throughout Murray&#x2019;s life.&nbsp; <br><br> Five years later, Pauli Murray, a twenty-eight-year-old aspiring writer, wrote a letter to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt protesting racial segregation in the South. The president&#x2019;s staff forwarded Murray&#x2019;s letter to the federal Office of Education. The first lady wrote back.<br><br>Murray&#x2019;s letter was prompted by a speech the president had given at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, praising the school for its commitment to social progress. Pauli Murray had been denied admission to the Chapel Hill graduate school because of her race.&nbsp; <br><br> She wrote in her letter of 1938:<br><br> &#x201c;Does it mean that Negro students in the South will be allowed to sit down with white students and study a problem which is fundamental and mutual to both groups? Does it mean that the University of North Carolina is ready to open its doors to Negro students . . . ? Or does it mean, that everything you said has no meaning for us as Negroes, that again we are to be set aside and passed over . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to Murray: &#x201c;I have read the copy of the letter you sent me and I understand perfectly, but great changes come slowly . . . The South is changing, but don&#x2019;t push too fast.&#x201d;<br><br> So began a friendship between Pauli Murray (poet, intellectual rebel, principal strategist in the fight to preserve Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, cofounder of the National Organization for Women, and the first African American female Episcopal priest) and Eleanor Roosevelt (first lady of the United States, later first chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and chair of the President&#x2019;s Commission on the Status of Women) that would last for a quarter of a century.<br><br>Drawing on letters, journals, diaries, published and unpublished manuscripts, and interviews, Patricia Bell-Scott gives us the first close-up portrait of this evolving friendship and how it was sustained over time, what each gave to the other, and how their friendship changed the cause of American social justice.</p><p><p><b>PATRICIA BELL-SCOTT</b>&nbsp;is professor emerita of women&#x2019;s studies and human development and family science at the University of Georgia.

She lives in Athens, Georgia, with her husband, Charles V. Underwood Jr.</p>1<br><br>&#x201c;It Is the Problem of My People&#x201d;<br><br>The clatter of Pauli Murray&#x2019;s old typewriter bounced off the walls of her one-room Harlem apartment on December 6, 1938. Working at breakneck speed, she stopped only to look over a line in her letter or take a drag from her ever-present cigarette. Although she was only five-foot-two and weighed 105 pounds, she hammered the keys with the focus of a prizefighter. She had been forced to move three times because neighbors found the noise intolerable.<br><br>The catalyst for Murray&#x2019;s current agitation was Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s speech at the University of North Carolina the day before. It was his first address since the 1938 midterm elections and the fourth visit to the university by an incumbent president. The reports of his isolation at his vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia, and the arrangements for radio broadcasts to Europe and Latin America had sparked international interest in his speech.<br><br>Thousands lined the motorcade path to UNC in the drenching rain, holding handmade signs and flags, hoping to catch a glimpse of the fifty-six-year-old president in his open car. When it became apparent that there would be no break in the downpour, organizers moved the festivities from Kenan Stadium to the brand-new Woollen Gymnasium. There, in an over-capacity crowd of ten thousand, a man fainted from the swelter. Many people went to other campus buildings to listen to the broadcast. Countless numbers stood outside the gym in the rain. Before FDR spoke, the university band played &#x201c;Hail to the Chief,&#x201d; school officials awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree, and an African American choir sang spirituals.<br><br>Under the glare of klieg lights, the warmth of his academic regalia, and the weight of his steel leg braces, the president made his way to the flag-draped platform. He paused often during his twenty-five-minute address for roaring applause, wiping his face with the handkerchief he slipped in and out of his pocket, gripping the lectern to maintain his balance. He praised the university for its &#x201c;liberal teaching&#x201d; and commitment to social progress. He declared his faith in youth and democracy. He urged Americans to embrace &#x201c;the kind of change&#x201d; necessary &#x201c;to meet new social and economic needs.&#x201d;<br><br>Having listened to the broadcast the day before, Murray underlined passages in the speech from the New York Times front-page story &#x201c;Roosevelt Urges Nation to Continue Liberalism.&#x201d; The &#x201c;contradiction&#x201d; between the president&#x2019;s rhetoric and her experience of the South made her boil. She would never forget the day a bus driver told her to &#x201c;relieve&#x201d; herself in &#x201c;an open field&#x201d; because the public toilets were for whites only. Insulted, she rode in agony for two hours, not knowing if there would be toilet facilities for blacks at the next stop.<br><br>Murray wondered if it mattered to the president that the &#x201c;liberal institution&#x201d; that had just granted him an honorary doctorate, and of which he claimed to be a &#x201c;proud and happy&#x201d; alumnus, barred black students from its hallowed halls and confined those blacks who came to hear him to a segregated section. Did he understand the psychological wounds or the economic costs of segregation? And how could he rationally or morally associate a whites-only admissions policy with liberalism or social progress? Having applied to UNC&#x2019;s graduate program in sociology a month before FDR&#x2019;s visit, Murray aimed to see just how liberal the school was.<br><br>...<br><br>exacerbating murray&#x2019;s frustration with the president was his previous condemnation of lynching as &#x201c;a vile form of collective murder&#x201d; and his recent silence during a thirty-day Senate filibuster of the Wagner&#x2013;Van Nuys bill that would have made lynching a federal offense. After the bill died, FDR proposed that a standing committee of Congress or the attorney general investigate &#x201c;lynchings and incidents of mob violence.&#x201d;<br><br>The black press lashed out against his political maneuvering. The New York Amsterdam News condemned him for keeping &#x201c;his tongue in his cheek!&#x201d; The Chicago Defender called him &#x201c;an artful dodger.&#x201d; The Louisiana Weekly, predicting that blacks would abandon the Democratic Party, declared, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too late, Mr. President, and what you say is NOTHING.&#x201d;<br><br>Murray understood that FDR&#x2019;s reticence on anti-lynching legislation was an attempt to placate conservative politicians from the South, where whites lynched blacks with impunity. Her introduction to politics had begun as a preschooler, reading newspaper headlines to her grandfather Robert Fitzgerald, a Union army veteran whose injury in the Civil War cost him his vision in his old age. Robert, originally from Pennsylvania, settled in North Carolina after the war to teach ex-slaves. He had also nurtured his granddaughter&#x2019;s intellect and her love of African American literature and history. That this year marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation made the president&#x2019;s inaction even more objectionable to Murray. Since 1863, more than three thousand blacks had been lynched, and at least seventy of these murders had taken place during FDR&#x2019;s presidency.<br><br>Murray&#x2019;s indignation was rooted in bone-chilling stories she had heard as a child of racial brutality and the Klansmen who circled her grandfather&#x2019;s property nightly on horseback, threatening to shut down his school for blacks. Ever brave, Robert had kept &#x201c;his musket loaded&#x201d; and the school door open. Murray had her own stories, too.<br><br>When she was six years old and on her way to fetch water from a community well, she and a neighbor came upon a group of blacks gathered around the body of young John Henry Corniggins, sprawled near a patch of thorny shrubs. Murray saw &#x201c;his feet first, the white soles sticking out of the grass and caked with mud, then his scratched brown legs.&#x201d; His eyes were open. Blood seeped through a bullet hole in his shirt near his heart. John Henry lay motionless as large green flies wandered over his face and into his mouth. Nearby, a solitary &#x201c;buzzard circled.&#x201d; Murray raced home, trembling in a cold sweat. The word among blacks was that a white man had assumed John Henry was stealing watermelons and shot him. No evidence of theft was found near the boy&#x2019;s body. No one was arrested for his murder.<br><br>Six years later, violence touched Murray&#x2019;s family when a white guard at Maryland&#x2019;s Hospital for the Negro Insane murdered her father. At the funeral, she could hardly believe that the &#x201c;purple&#x201d; bloated body in the gray casket was her once proud father. She was horrified by the sight of his mangled head, which had been &#x201c;split open like a melon&#x201d; during an autopsy &#x201c;and sewed together loosely with jagged stitches crisscrossing the blood-clotted line of severance.&#x201d;<br><br>...<br><br>the fight over anti-lynching legislation was but one of Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s worries. His attempt to purge Congress of his enemies had failed, and a coalition of anti&#x2013;New Deal Republicans and Democrats had emerged. Despite the continuing economic depression, important legislation remained deadlocked. Frightening developments loomed on the world stage, as well. Under Adolf Hitler, Germany&#x2019;s aggression in Europe escalated with the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. During Kristallnacht, hundreds of synagogues were destroyed. Thousands of Jews were stripped of their citizenship, property, and business rights and sent to concentration camps.<br><br>As Murray pounded out her letter to the president, she recalled Eleanor Roosevelt&#x2019;s visit to Camp Tera. Murray had been following reports about the first lady, listening to her radio broadcast, and reading her syndicated newspaper column, &#x201c;My Day,&#x201d; since it had begun publication, on December 30, 1935. In it, ER chronicled get-togethers with family and friends, meetings with public figures, impressions of what she saw during her travels, and her opinions on a range of cultural and political matters. Writing the column six days a week and meeting her duties as first lady, which frequently went past midnight, required her to compose on the go. After one day-long visit to Camp Jane Addams (as Camp Tera had been renamed, in 1936, in honor of the first American woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize), Tommy sat her typewriter on a rock near the Bear Mountain Bridge so that ER could dictate her copy and meet her deadline.<br><br>Southern segregation made ER uncomfortable, and she did not enjoy going to FDR&#x2019;s Warm Springs cottage, despite the delight he took in the place. She did not accompany the president to UNC, but two weeks earlier, she had attended the Southern Conference for Human Welfare in Birmingham, Alabama, on her own. SCHW was an interracial gathering of liberals who met to discuss health, economics, housing, labor, race relations, voting rights, opportunities for young people, and agricultural issues affecting the region. The conferees included a mix of labor, religious, youth, and civil rights activists, politicians, government administrators, journalists, educators, and representatives from organizations affiliated with the socialist and Communist movements.<br><br>ER was the most celebrated attendee, and her presence drew the national press. Of her whirlwind schedule, a New York Times reporter noted, &#x201c;Mrs. Roosevelt arrived at 5 o&#x2019;clock this morning . . . and rested until 8 o&#x2019;clock and thereafter in rapid succession held a press conference, visited several institutions, spoke informally to an afternoon session meeting on youth problems and tonight gave an address on &#x2018;Democracy in Education.&#x2019; &#x201d; Seven thousand people, nearly half of them black, jammed into the city auditorium to hear her speak about the importance of &#x201c;universal education&#x201d; and the contribution each citizen makes to the nation, &#x201c;regardless of nationality or race.&#x201d; She fielded questions for the better part of an hour.<br><br>The first lady&#x2019;s participation at the SCHW was historic. However, her skillful circumvention of a local ordinance requiring segregated seating was what interested Murray most. When city officials learned that conferees were mingling freely during sessions, without regard to race, the police came and directed everyone to obey local law. Having walked into a session late, ER sat down in the black section near her friend Mary McLeod Bethune, who was now director of the Negro Affairs Division in the National Youth Administration. When the police ordered ER to move, she had her chair placed between the white and black delegations. And it was there she sat, symbolically outside of racial strictures, for the remainder of the conference.<br><br>The first lady&#x2019;s deft reaction warmed the hearts of conferees, angered segregationists, and thrilled the black press. The influential Afro-American newspaper, of which Murray was a devoted reader, underscored the significance of ER&#x2019;s aisle-straddling tactic by proclaiming, &#x201c;Sometimes actions speak louder than words.&#x201d;<br><br>...<br><br>after camp tera, Murray got a job with the Works Progress Administration, initially as a remedial reading teacher, then with the Workers&#x2019; Education Project. Now that the WPA was in jeopardy, she planned to return to North Carolina, where she could do graduate work at UNC and look after her adoptive mother, Aunt Pauline. The thought of living in the South again filled Murray with dread. On the other hand, it seemed worth the sacrifice to further her education and be with family.<br><br>In no mood for armchair liberalism, Murray counted herself among a group of young radicals incensed by FDR&#x2019;s &#x201c;coziness with white supremacy in the South.&#x201d; She reasoned that if UNC were half the institution the president said it was, its administration would find a way to accommodate her. Murray knew of only one way to challenge his roundly praised address. She typed a bold missive, spelling out what the South was like for blacks, daring him to take a stand as a fellow Christian for democracy and the liberal principles he espoused.<br><br>December 6, 1938<br><br>Dear President Roosevelt:<br><br>I pray that this letter will get past your secretaries and reach your personal consideration.<br><br>Have you time to listen to the problem of one of your millions of fellow-citizens, which will illustrate most clearly one of the problems of democracy in America. I speak not only for myself but for 12,000,000 other citizens.<br><br>Briefly, the facts are these:<br><br>I am a Negro, the most oppressed, most misunderstood and most neglected section of your population.<br><br>I am also a WPA worker, another insecure and often misrepresented group of citizens. I teach on the Workers&#x2019; Education Project of New York City, a field which has received the constant and devoted support of your wife, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.<br><br>My main interest, the tradition of my family for three generations, is education, which, I believe, is the basic requirement for the maintenance and extension of democracy.<br><br>At present, in order to do a competent teaching job, a job comparable to the work of established educational institutions, like all other professional WPA workers, I feel the need of more training. To understand the knotty economic and social problems of our country and to interpret these problems clearly and simply to workers makes it imperative that we continue our studies. Our wage standards are such that we are unable to further our education. Those of us who do not have degrees are unable to get them because of the general WPA arrangements. Those of us who have degrees, and yet feel an inadequacy of information and formal training, find it impossible to go further and obtain our Master&#x2019;s Degree.<br><br>Sometime ago I applied to the University of North Carolina for admission to their graduate school. They sent me an application blank, on the bottom of which was asked, &#x201c;Race and Religion.&#x201d; (For your information, I am a confirmed Protestant Episcopalian.) As you know, no Negro has ever been admitted to the University of North Carolina. You may wonder then, why I, a Negro knowing this fact, did make application.<br><br>My grandfather, a Union Army soldier, gave his eye for the liberation of his race. As soon as the war was over, he went to North Carolina under the Freedmen&#x2019;s Bureau to establish schools and educate the newly freed Negroes. From that time on my entire family has been engaged in educational work in that state. My own father was a principal of one of the Baltimore City schools and my sisters and brothers are also teachers. You passed through Durham, where my family lived and worked, and where my aunt now a woman of sixty-eight years, still plods back and forth to her school training future citizens of America. This aunt has been teaching since she was fifteen years old, and for more than thirty years in the Durham Public Schools, and yet if she were to become disabled tomorrow, there is no school pension system which would take care of her, neither does she qualify for the Old Age Pension system which excludes teachers.<br><br>12,000,000 of your citizens have to endure insults, injustices, and such degradation of spirit that you would believe impossible as a human being and a Christian. We are forced to ride in prescribed places in the busses and street cars of those very cities you passed through in our beloved Southland. When your party reached the station at Durham yesterday, you must have noticed a sign which said &#x201c;White,&#x201d; and then a fence, then another sign which said &#x201c;Colored.&#x201d; Can you, for one moment, put yourself in our place and imagine the feelings of resentment, the protest, the indignation, the outrage that would rise within you to realize that you, a human being, with the keen sensitivities of other human beings were being set off in a corner, marked apart from your fellow human beings?</p><h2>As Consciousness Is Harnessed to Flesh: Journals and Notebooks, 1964-1980</h2><p><p>This, the second of three volumes of Susan Sontag's journals and notebooks, begins where the first volume left off, in the middle of the 1960s.

Today, when American "exceptionalism," as it is called, has become the subject of academic study, the United States, except in wealth and military power, is less exceptional than it was in the years when it was to be reached only by sailing ship across the Atlantic. Then, before American culture had been universalised by Hollywood, the technology of television, and the international music industry, America really was a different place and society from the Old World, which had given it birth. Europeans who made the voyage noted differences of every sort, not only political and economic, but human and social as well. Americans were bigger than Europeans&#x2014;even their slaves were bigger than their African forebears&#x2014;thanks to the superabundance of food that American farms produced. American parents allowed their children a freedom not known in Europe; they shrank from punishing their sons and daughters in the ways European fathers and mothers did. Ulysses S. Grant, the future general in chief of the Union armies and president of the United States, recalled in his memoirs that there was "never any scolding or punishment by my parents, no objection to rational enjoyments such as fishing, going to the creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting my grandparents in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on the ice in winter, taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the ground." It was a description of childhood as experienced in most prosperous country-dwelling families of the period. The Grants were modestly well-to-do, Jesse Grant, the future president's father, having a tanning business and also working an extensive property of arable land and forest. But then most established American families, and the Grants had come to the New World in 1630, were prosperous. It was prosperity that underlay their easy way with their offspring, since they were not obliged to please neighbours by constraining their children. The children of the prosperous were nevertheless well-behaved because they were schooled and churchgoing. The two went together, though not in lockstep. Lincoln was a notably indulgent father though he was not a doctrinal Christian. Churchgoing America, overwhelmingly Protestant before 1850, needed to read the Bible, and north of the Mason-Dixon line, which informally divided North from South, four-fifths of Americans could read and write. Almost all American children in the North, and effectively all in New England, went to school, a far higher proportion than in Europe, where literacy even in Britain, France, and Germany lay around two-thirds. America was also becoming college-going, with the seats of higher education, Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, the College of William and Mary, established and flourishing. America could afford to fund and run colleges because it was already visibly richer than Europe, rich agriculturally, though it was not yet a food-exporting economy, and increasingly rich industrially. It was a newspaper country with a vast newspaper-reading public and a large number of local and some widely distributed city newspapers. Its medical profession was large and skilful, and the inventiveness and mechanical aptitude of its population was remarked upon by all visitors. So too was the vibrant and passionate nature of its politics. America was already a country of ideas and movements, highly conscious of its birth in freedom and its legacy of revolution; anti-imperialism had been its founding principle. During the decades before the Civil War, America was experiencing an industrial boom and its own distinctive industrial revolution. England's industrial revolution had taken its impetus from the development of steam power, fuelled by the island's abundant deposits of coal and directed to the exploitation of its large deposits of metal ores. Early-nineteenth-century America was also beginning to dig coal and iron ore, of which its soil contained enormous quantities, but at the outset it was two other sources of power which drove its proliferating factories and workshops: waterpower and wood. The rivers of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania were harnessed to turn waterwheels and its extensive forests to supply timber for burning. In Europe the days were long gone when forests could be cut down to supply heat. The Continent, outside Scandinavia and the Russian interior, was highly deforested. In America, trees were still an encumbrance which had to be felled to provide land for farming, but which also, when sawn, provided the raw material for every sort of building and manufactured item. America needed deforestation if its soils were to be farmed in the future, and in that process industrialisation and land clearing went hand in hand. During the 1830s and later, New York City consumed several million loads of wood every year, cut and stripped from Maine and New Jersey. It was only gradually that mines were dug and extended, originally by immigrants from the English coalfields and Welsh valleys, but by 1860 production in the Pennsylvanian anthracite fields had increased fortyfold in thirty years. By that date a distinctive economic geography of the United States could be discerned, with expanding industrial regions centred on New York and Philadelphia, exploited coalfields in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Allegheny region of the Appalachians, a developing industrial region around Pittsburgh, and a thriving textile and engineering zone in southern New England. In the North the proportion of farmworkers in the labour force had fallen below 40 percent, while it remained above 80 percent in the South. An economic map would show that there was no industrial centre south of a line drawn from St. Louis to Louisville to Baltimore; in the South nine-tenths of the population lived in the countryside, but in the North only a quarter. Timber also provided the steam power for paddleboats, which by 1850 were to be seen on every navigable waterway, and the railway locomotives, which were becoming familiar on the tracks which were stretching out to link all the more important cities to one another and to the seaboard ports. By 1850 there were 9,000 miles of track in the United States; by 1860, 30,000. Rivers and then canals had been the means of transportation and distribution in the early stages of the boom. Canal boats and river steamers were rapidly overtaken in importance by the railroad. By 1850, America had surpassed Britain, home of the railroad revolution, in miles of operating track; indeed, American track mileage exceeded that of the rest of the world put together.<br><br>The United States was still an industrial client of Europe, particularly Britain, from which most manufactured goods came, but that was due to Britain's head start in the industrial revolution. By the end of the century this would no longer be the case. In the meantime, America was ceasing to be a predominately rural country and becoming an urban one. At the outbreak of the Civil War, America had more country-dwellers than town-dwellers, many more in the South, but the trend was for town-dwellers to outnumber country-dwellers. Cities were being founded at a breakneck rate and growing at exponential speed. The old cities of colonial settlement, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, retained their importance, but new cities were appearing and expanding, particularly beyond the Appalachian chain and even beyond the Mississippi; for a time Cincinnati promised to be the most important of the new metropolises, but it was rapidly overtaken by Chicago, which grew from a population of 5,000 in 1840 to 109,000 in 1860. It might be said that Chicago was only keeping pace with the United States itself, whose population increased from 5,306,000 in 1800 to 23,192,000 in 1850. Part of the increase came from migration, though the decades of mass immigration lay in the future; most of it was the result of a high birthrate. The astonishing productivity of the United States furnished work for all who chose to stay in the towns, while the abundant availability of land for settlement in the new states beyond the Appalachians and the Mississippi attracted would-be farmers, or employed farmers seeking better land, in large numbers. In whichever direction a visitor to the United States looked, the country was growing. <br><br>It was not that America was giving up the land. On the contrary: in the twenty years before 1860 enormous areas of the subcontinent were put under the plough; but the work was done by internal migrants who abandoned their homes on the thin, worked-out soils of New England, Virginia, and the Carolinas to trek westward into the new land in and beyond the Mississippi and Missouri valleys. Federal land policy encouraged the migrants. In 1800 public land was sold at $2 an acre, with a quarter to be paid down and four years to pay off the residue. By 1820 the price had gone down to $1.25 an acre. Land was sold in subdivisions of a section of 640 acres. By 1832 the government accepted bids for a quarter of a quarter section, 40 acres. In 1862 Congress passed the Homestead Act, which allowed a settler free possession of 160 acres if farmed for five years. The legislation effectively transferred eighty million acres of public land into private hands, and accommodated half a million people. American land policy was the making of such states as Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, the Middle West proper. As settlement moved on to the more distant lands of the prairies in Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska, the first comers got the best of the deal. The prairies were settled during an uncharacteristic era of moist climate, which conferred bountiful crops on the hardworking. By the twentieth century, desiccation had set in and many farms joined the dust bowl.<br><br>Settlement was not exclusively by free men. Cotton profits pulled plantation owners westward into new lands during the period 1830&#x2013;50, particularly onto the dark, rich soils of the "black belt" of Alabama and Mississippi, but even as far away as the river lands of Texas. It is calculated that 800,000 slaves were mo...</p><h2>A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)</h2><p>Murder in the twelfth century is no different from murder today.

This book brings together a vast selection of images by Chinese photographers since 1949, giving readers a visual journey across the great People&#39;s Republic; edited by esteemed photojournalist Liu Heung Shing, longtime Associated Press correspondent and Time magazine contributor. In post-Mao China, late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping urged his one billion countrymen to &#34;&#34;seek truth from facts.&#34;&#34; Taking its cue from Deng&#39;s overture, China today is the leading economic story of the 21st century. The process by which China navigated the path from periphery to a central position in world affairs dominates the debate about Asia and China&#39;s relationship to the western world. Pulitzer-winning photojournalist Liu Heung Shing charts the visual history of sixty years of the People&#39;s Republic (1949 to 2008), and along the way aims to illustrate the humanistic course.</p><p>Liu Heung Shing&#39;s journalistic involvement with China runs parallel with the development of the People&#39;s Republic. Following the 1979 China-U.S. diplomatic normalization, Liu was Time Magazine&#39;s first photojournalist based in Beijing. His first story was on the death of Mao Zedong. He has worked as a foreign correspondent for the The Associated Press in Beijing (1979-1983), Los Angeles (1983-85), New Delhi (19851-89), Seoul (1989-1990) and Moscow (1990-1993). Liu is the author of China After Mao (Penguin 1982), and USSR: Collapse of an Empire (Associated Press 1992).

Most children will skip the foreword by Lewis' stepson and the brief sketch of Lewis' childhood (although both are accessible to young readers) and go straight to the letters themselvesa selection arranged chronologically, with some deletions to promote clarity and eliminate repetition. Most of the letters concern Narnia, but there are also touching letters to Lewis' godchild. Some letters offer encouragement and advice to young writers. Often correspondence was carried on with the same children over a number of years, and the letters answer questions that children might still have. Some letters are preceded by explanations in brackets, and there are plenty of explanatory footnotes. Lewis' few theological discussions are not overwhelming and, except for a few instances, are quite clear. The bibliography includes books and other media and is divided into two sections, one of interest to children, the other for advanced readers, parents and teachers.

Eating this responsibly is certainly an admirable pursuit, but home cooking of this caliber can be intimidating, requiring much more energy than it would to pull up to the drive-through and order a burger and fries. In <i>The Healthy Kitchen</i>, Weil successfully teams up with Rosie Daley, formerly chef at the ritzy Cal-a-Vie Spa, to show how to cook with confidence within these dietary guidelines, creating dishes that are not only good for you, but are also fun to prepare, beautiful to look at, and delectable.<p> For those of you predicting a tofu-fest, have no fear: Weil stresses he's "unwilling to eat food that is boring, artless, and devoid of pleasure even if it's somebody else's idea of healthful." Indeed, the gorgeous color photography in <i>The Healthy Kitchen</i> will get you drooling over healthy entr�es like Warm Chicken and Asparagus Salad and desserts like Lemon Yogurt Sorbet. You can be proud to serve these recipes to your family and friends--many of the appetizers and entr�es are perfect party foods, sized to feed a dozen. Some recipes are notably more complicated than others--Cold Vegetable Pasta Primavera involves grilling five different veggies; baked Vegetable Wontons are time-consuming if you're not familiar with the folding process. However, Daley and Weil advise working your way up to these more complex dishes.</p><p> Sprinkled throughout the book are witty and wise health tips from Weil and cooking shortcuts from Daley. The two admit they don't agree on all cooking matters; Weil would substitute cashew milk for coconut milk and adds his two cents on making the Thai Shrimp and Papaya Salad spicier, for example. <i>The Healthy Kitchen</i> seems to be influenced a bit by Martha Stewart's <i>Healthy Quick Cook</i>, with Weil's text shaded in that unmistakably Martha sage-green, and Daley's in what Stewart might call bisque. Both books emphasize seasonal fresh foods and boast sumptuous photography and tempting menu suggestions. However, Weil and Daley outdo her with calorie and nutritional breakdowns for each dish, shopping guides for easy meal planning, and tips on encouraging children to help out in the kitchen (and develop lifelong healthy eating habits in the process). <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p><b>Andrew Weil, M.D.</b>, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School, is Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of Arizona.

He tilted his head back and gazed up into the immense vault of the sky, feeling wonderfully alone.<br>To the youngest child of a large and brawling family, privacy is a rare thing. Brian always seemed to be walking in someone else's shadow. He had sought this hill because, at the moment, no one else claimed it, and he held his occupancy uncontested.<br>In a tentative voice he addressed the darkening gray sky. "I am the king," he said, tasting the words. He heard no argument, so he repeated it. Louder. Standing up. "I am the king of all the kings!" he cried, throwing wide his arms to embrace as much as possible of his domain.<br>* * *<br>The tireless wind swept across the green land. It came driving inland from the sea, herding a flock of rain clouds before it and releasing them at last above the wooded hills and granite mountains.<br>Even before the rain fell the air was saturated, heavy and rich with a wetness like the moist breath of babies. Ferns in their dark hollows burned with an emerald flame; the curving flanks of the mountains glistened, polished; the air smelled of life and death and growing things.<br>Under the cairns and dolmens, within the ruined ring forts and passage graves, deep in the mossy, haunted earth, ghosts stirred. Giants and heroes and cowards slept their thousand year death in the ancient soil and were aware in their powdered bones of the coming of another spring.<br>* * *<br>Brigid came to find him, of course. Even the littlest boy had tasks to perform, and Brian was assigned to guard the flock of tame geese that nibbled grass along the banks of the Shannon. Cennedi had no small daughters to be goose-girls.<br>"Aha, here you are!" Brigid crowed as he came up over the breast of the hill. "Never where you're supposed to be, are you? Your mother's geese could be in a wolf's belly by now for all the good you've been to them." She reached out to pinch his shoulder and give him a shaking, but Brian backed away. He was not about to accept punishment from a girl who was merely the daughter of his father's herdsman.<br>"The geese are all right," he told her confidently, trying to shade his boyish treble so that she would recognize it as a kingly voice. "I can protect them; I can protect <i>all</i> this!" He gestured expansively to indicate his kingdom.<br>But Brigid was a hard-working girl with chores of her own, resentful at being summoned from them to fetch an errant child, and she had no interest in a little boy's pretend world. She stood before him with her hands on her hips, her tangled chestnut hair whipped about her face by the rising wind. "And how would you be knowing they're all right, when you probably haven't laid eyes on them all afternoon? You come with me right now, and we'll try to get them back to Boruma before this storm blows them away."<br>She extended a red-knuckled hand to him and, after a brief hesitation, he took it. The two of them started down the hill as the first drops of rain splattered about them. Brigid checked her stride and looked at the little boy.<br>"And did you come out with no warm clothes? What have you done with your bratt?"<br>Brian stared blankly up into her stern face, then looked around him. A few yards distant, crumpled and forgotten, lay his bratt, the heavy cloak that was a necessity in the damp climate. Until Brigid mentioned it he had been unaware of the cold, but suddenly the red wool looked inviting.<br>He retrieved it quickly and handed it to her to pin around him with the silver brooch that was his only personal wealth. The wind, which seemed to have been waiting until the child was snugly wrapped, responded with a rising howl that sent Brian and Brigid plunging headlong down the slope together, anxious to get the geese to their pen and themselves under a roof.<br>They trotted hand in hand through the rain until they caught up with the scattered flock, grazing in the marshy grass at the river's edge. Brigid, twice Brian's age and size, moved after them with the dogged persistence of one who knows a task will get done somehow. Brian darted about like quicksilver, second-guessing the nimble geese, turning and maneuvering them with a skill beyond his years.<br>To Brigid his antics were annoying; she was afraid he would scatter the birds and delay them both in the increasingly chill rain. But Brian was not herding geese; in the well-lit inner landscape of his mind he was a general, marshaling his troops, wheeling and driving them with the expertise of a battlefield veteran. His imagination quickly reduced Brigid to the role of second in command, so that he was angered when she guided the geese according to some plan of her own.<br>"Not that way!" he shouted to her. "Take them up the path through the trees!" Open country was not safe, his army could be spotted too easily by enemy scouts!<br>"And lose half of them in the woods before we get them home?" Brigid countered indignantly. "Your mother would have my hide for the pot! Do come along, Brian, and quit playing around; the both of us will be soaked before we get these stupid birds penned!"<br>Actually, Brian was right. The path through the trees was shorter and more direct, and once the geese were headed home, their awakening memory of grain was sufficient to keep them going in the right direction. But Brigid had never seen them taken by any course but across the meadow, so that was the way they must go. Flapping her sodden skirt at them, clucking and shooing, she drove them before her as Brian watched in frustration.<br>"She thinks I don't know anything," he fumed to himself, wiping a lock of dripping red hair from his freckled forehead. "Nobody ever listens to me." He kicked at a small stone that lay invitingly near his foot, then turned to gaze once more at his chosen line of march; he shrugged his shoulders and set off in the wake of Brigid and the flock. "Next time," he promised himself under his breath, "I'll bring them my own way."<br>The thatched roofs of home glowed golden through the rain. Set in a magnificent grove of oak and pine, Boruma had been built by the princes of the Dal Cais on the ruins of an old ring fort, or <i>dun</i>, utilizing its earthen wall and deep ditch as the perimeter of their personal compound. In keeping with his status as tribal king, Cennedi's round timber-and-wattle dwelling was the largest of the buildings. It occupied a central position opposite the gate, surrounded by the homes of his noble kinsmen and domestic buildings and pens for stock. Beyond the wall were the farming lands of the Dal Cais and the cottages of the plowmen. Boruma was--almost--a town, and as large a concentration of people as one could find outside the monasteries and the port cities built by the Norsemen from the distant shores of the place they called Lochlann.<br>The geese broke into a waddling run as they drew near the gate of the compound. All winter Brian's mother had fattened them in a brush-and-timber pen, feeding them on sprouted grain and bread soaked in barley water. That memory called strongly to them now.<br>"You feed those birds better than you feed me," Cennedi liked to complain to his wife; but she always had the same smiling answer: "You will get it all eventually, and bad grain and stale bread are much improved by being converted into fat gooseflesh."<br>"Practical," Cennedi sighed to himself, "she's so practical." Left to his own devices, the chieftain of the tribe was inclined to daydreaming and grandiose visions. It was his wife who saw that nothing was wasted, that food was stored in the souterrains each autumn, and that mattresses were replaced and weapons sharpened in the spring.<br>Today she was busy in the miller's shed, grinding flour in the communal stone quern. A handsome woman who had not outgrown her beauty, Bebinn looked at the World through calm gray eyes, set in large sockets beneath arching brows. She lifted one feathery brow even higher as the commotion outside announced the arrival of Brian, Brigid, and the geese.<br>Pouring through the gate, the geese headed straight for their feeding pen, just in time to encounter Cennedi's brace of shaggy wolfhounds returning from some adventure of their own. Forgetting their usual discipline, the dogs flung themselves joyously into the flock, yapping and snapping in mock attack and setting off a cacophony of squawks that brought faces peering from doorways throughout the compound.<br>Within a matter of moments all was chaos. Bebinn remained at the quern, an amused smile curving her lips. She expected, with justification, that the commotion would become a war and she would be called upon to pacify it.<br>Soon enough her husband came storming into the miller's hut, waving his fists and complaining bitterly about the amount of peace a man could expect in his own household.<br>"Your son is out there now, woman, running the feathers off the geese and exciting my hounds so much they'll be no good for hunting for a fortnight! Can't you control that child?"<br>"I am controlling him," Bebinn responded evenly, not lifting her eyes from her work. "I gave him the job of minding the fowl, to teach him discipline and responsibility."<br>"Discipline! Responsibility! I tell you, he's out there playing with them, like a wolf harrying lambs! Is that how you want your geese tended?" A massive man with graying hair that had once been the same bright copper as Brian's, Cennedi had a tendency to turn crimson in the face when he was excited. The more he blustered and waved his hands, the calmer his wife became.<br>"He will always have to make mistakes and suffer for them, if he is to learn," she replied. "If some of the geese are damaged we will cook and eat them, and he shall watch us do it while he goes hungry. And he will learn. But there is nothing to be gained if you go out there yelling and adding to the upset."<br>"It might not do him any good," Cennedi retorted, "but it will give me a mighty amount of comfort!" He boiled out of the hut, intent on catching his smallest son and rendering him incapable of further mischief.<br>Bebinn released the handle of the quern and wiped her hands on her skirt. She peered out through the slanting rain, watching as her husband flung himself into the melee. Her eyes were warm with the tolerance of a woman who has borne and raised a dozen sons.<br>She pulled her shawl over her silver-threaded dark hair and walked briskly across the compound to her house. At the door she turned to look again at the seething mass, to which a new element of confusion had been added as the other Dal Cais menfolk returned from field and pasture. Men were picking their way among flapping geese and darting dogs, and the earth was churned into a sticky sea of mud.<br>The air rang with imaginative profanity.<br>Bebinn ran her fingers in an unconscious, loving gesture over the elaborately carved doorposts of her home, the gleaming wood polished by her frequent caress. "Come and eat, Cennedi!" she cried between the gusts of wind, her deep voice booming out from her full bosom. "Come and eat, or I shall use it to fatten the hogs in the forest!"<br>Faces turned toward her, activity lessened for a moment. Satisfied, she went indoors, and soon the cessation of noise from outside assured her the geese had been penned at last. Brian came trudging home, covered with mud, and was followed almost immediately by the vast troop of his brothers, returning from the hilly pasturage where they tended the cattle, the "walking gold" of the Dal Cais.<br>They came in one by one and two by two, tall young men and stripling boys, peeling off their wet bratts and shaking water everywhere as they hung the dripping cloaks close to the fire to dry. They lined up at the hearth, where Bebinn bent over her cauldron, so that each might kiss his mother after his own fashion. Lachtna and Niall and Echtigern. Donncuan, who was to replace Brigid's father one day as chief herdsman. Dermott and Muiredach and Conn the Quarrelsome. Benin and Marcan and Anluan, with his perpetual cough.<br>Sitting on his little three-legged stool by the fire, reveling in the smells of his mother's cooking, Brian watched the doorway eagerly until Mahon's broad shoulders filled it. He knew that sometime during the evening he could expect a tongue-lashing from his father; but that would be all right, he could bear it, if he could look up and see Mahon's slight smile and subtle wink.<br>His other brothers did not notice him sitting there in smallness. Even Anluan, nearest him in age, only paid him the attention of sticking out his tongue as he shoved past to salute Bebinn.<br>Cennedi would not come in to his own hearth and dinner until the men of Boruma were home and the day's business ended. Bebinn believed in discipline and self-restraint for her sons, but she did not expect the imposible; as soon as Mahon arrived she began handing out the crusty loaves of bread, and ladling thick chunks of meat from the pot.<br>Every edible that came to her hand was simmering in that pot: beef and fowl, with grain and herbs and mushrooms from the woods beyond the compound. Niall had even devised a little tray that his mother could put beneath roasting meat, so that the drippings could be caught and saved for her fragrant stews.<br>The meal was not a quiet one. Each boy customarily strove to outdo the others in his ability to talk with his mouth full.<br>"There will be too many cows of breeding age this spring; the red bull can never cover them all."<br>"Nonsense! You're just saying that because you want to try that gangly brown calf of yours on some of the cows. But he's no good for breeding; you've spoiled him rotten and ruined his temper."<br>"I have not! I raised him myself because he was orphaned, but I never spoiled him. He's the best young bull we've ever had, and he'll be given the entire herd someday. Just ask Mahon, if you don't believe me!"<br>The two boys--neither of whom had any say over the policies of breeding--turned to Mahon as the final arbiter of their dispute. Mahon helped himself to a steaming gobbet of meat, chewed it reflectively, winked down the table at Brian, and began wiping out his bowl with his bread.<br>"It seems to me," he said at last, "that there is something to be said for both bulls. We must observe Liam and our father closely and see what they decide. Perhaps they will use the red one on the majority of the herd, and try the brown on those cows who need more vigor in their calves. But we'll wait and see, and I'm certain we'll all learn something."<br>The air grew thick with the smell of food, and smoke, and damp clothes drying on warm young bodies. One of the tribeswomen arrived to help Bebinn just as Cennedi himself appeared at last in the doorway, followed by a stooped gray-beard wearing a silk-lined bratt.<br>"Welcome, Fiacaid!" Bebinn hailed the oldster in the nightly ritual. "Will you do us the honor of sharing our evening meal?"<br>The old man bowed his acceptance and took the seat of honor at Cennedi's right hand, the place that was his from long custom. He was old, and frail, the nobly sculptured bones of his face hidden behind a network of lines like the creases in parchment, yellow and dead. Only his bright eyes were alive, glittering wetly beneath his tangled brows. The years of his maturity had been given in service to the Dal Cais as their <i>seanchai</i>, their historian and storyteller, and on a night such as this he often congratulated himself for having a talent that earned him a place at the table and a dry bed.<br>Bebinn selected the choicest contents of the pot for his bowl, and poured his mead herself, rather than entrust it to the serving woman.<br>"Will he tell a tale tonight?" the woman asked eagerly, almost treading on Bebinn's heels.<br>"How can I tell? The physician lives with your family...</p><h2>Stalin&#39;s Daughter: The Extraordinary and Tumultuous Life of Svetlana Alliluyeva</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the Plutarch Award for Best Biography</strong></p><p><strong>PEN Literary Award Finalist</strong></p><p><strong>National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist</strong></p><p><strong><em>New York Times </em>Notable Book</strong></p><p><strong><em>Washington Post </em>Notable Book</strong></p><p><strong><em>Boston Globe</em> Best Book of the Year</strong></p><p>The award-winning author of <em>Villa Air-Bel</em> returns with a painstakingly researched, revelatory biography of Svetlana Stalin, a woman fated to live her life in the shadow of one of history&#x2019;s most monstrous dictators&#x2014;her father, Josef Stalin.</p><p>Born in the early years of the Soviet Union, Svetlana Stalin spent her youth inside the walls of the Kremlin.

Eighty-five years later, she died alone and penniless in rural Wisconsin as Lana Peters. Revealed here for the first time, the many lives of Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s daughter form a riveting portrait of a woman who fled halfway around the world to escape her birthright. </p><p>Svetlana was protected from the mass starvation and murder that her father inflicted upon Soviet citizens, but she was not immune to tragedy. She lost almost everyone she loved, including her mother, who committed suicide, and her father&#x2019;s merciless purges claimed the lives of aunts and uncles, and her lover, who was exiled to Siberia.</p><p>After her father&#x2019;s death, Svetlana discovered the extent of his cruelty. Balking at the control the Kremlin still exerted over her life, she shocked the world by defecting to the United States at the height of the Cold War&#x2014;leaving behind two children. However, in America Svetlana found only more heartbreak. For a time, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s Taliesin community, overseen by his controversial third wife, Olgivanna, formed a second family for her; Svetlana married Wesley Peters, a member of the inner circle, and they had a child. But Olgivanna manipulated their friendship for financial gain, and the marriage disintegrated. No matter how much distance she put between her past and her present, she could not undo the emotional and psychological damage her father had wrought. </p>With access to FBI, CIA, and Russian State Archives, and with the close cooperation of Svetlana&#x2019;s daughter, Rosemary Sullivan has created a masterly biography that is epic in scope yet narrated with remarkable intimacy. <em>Stalin&#x2019;s Daughter </em>deftly places Svetlana in a broader context of time and place, without losing sight of her powerfully human story. In the process, this multifaceted narrative reveals the heart of a brutal world and offers an unprecedented look at its mastermind.<p>Rosemary Sullivan has written poetry, short fiction, biography, literary criticism, reviews, and articles. Her recent books include the critically acclaimed <em>Villa Air-Bel</em> and <em>Labyrinth of Desire</em>.

By turns witty, sardonic, and always insightful, Glenn O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s advice column has been a must-read for several generations of men (and their spouses and girlfriends). Having cut his teeth as a contributor at Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Interview in its heyday, O&#x2019;Brien sharpened them as the creative director of advertising at the hip department store Barneys New York for ten years before starting his advice column at Details magazine in 1996. Eventually his column, "The Style Guy," migrated to its permanent home at GQ magazine, where O&#x2019;Brien dispenses well-honed knowledge on matters ranging from how to throw a cocktail party (a diverse guest list is a must), putting together a wardrobe for a trip to Bermuda (pack more clothes for less dressing), or when it is appropriate to wear flip-flops in public (never). How To Be a Man is the culmination of O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s thirty years of accumulated style and etiquette wisdom, distilled through his gimlet eye and droll prose. With over forty chapters on style and fashion (and the difference), on dandies and dudes, grooming and decorating, on how to dress age-appropriately and how to age gracefully, this guide is the new essential read for men of all ages.</p><p>Glenn O&#x2019;Brien is a famous author, essayist, and bon vivant.

Then that&#x2019;s pretty much what I was offered, so I ended up going trillions of kilometers out of my way instead. A great many trillions of kilometers, and quite a few years&#x2014;which turns out to be much the greater distance.<br>&nbsp;<br>It began this way:<br>&nbsp;<br>Jinny Hamilton and I were dancing.<br>&nbsp;<br>This was something of an accomplishment for me, in and of itself&#x2014;I was born on Ganymede, and I had only been Earthside a few years, then. If you&#x2019;ve never experienced three times the gravity you consider normal, imagine doing your favorite dance . . . with somebody your own weight sitting on each of your shoulders, on a pedestal a few meters above concrete. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and concussions are hazards you simply learn to accept.<br>&nbsp;<br>But some people play water polo, voluntarily. Jinny and I had been going out together for most of a year, and dancing was one of her favorite recreations, so by now I had not only made myself learn how to dance, I&#x2019;d actually become halfway decent at it. Enough to dimly understand how someone with muscles of steel and infinite wind might consider it fun, anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>But that night was something else.<br>&nbsp;<br>Part of it was the setting, I guess. Your prom is supposed to be a magical time. It was still quite early in the evening, but the Hotel Vancouver ballroom was appropriately decorated and lit, and the band was excellent, especially the singer. Jinny was both the most beautiful and the most interesting person I had ever met. She and I were both finally done with Fermi Junior College, in Surrey, British Columbia. Class of 2286 (Restored Gregorian), huzzah&#x2014;go, Leptons! In the fall we&#x2019;d be going off to university together at Stony Brook, on the opposite coast of North America&#x2014;if my scholarship came through, anyway&#x2014;and in the meantime we were young, healthy, and hetero. The song being played was one I liked a lot, an ancient old ballad called &#x201c;On the Road to the Stars,&#x201d; that always brought a lump to my throat because it was one of my father&#x2019;s favorites.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s the reason we came from the mud, don&#x2019;t you know<br>&#x2019;cause we wanted to climb to the stars,<br>&nbsp;<br>In our flesh and our bone and our blood we all know<br>we were meant to return to the stars,<br>&nbsp;<br>Ask anyone which way is God, and you know<br>he will probably point to the stars . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>None of that explained the way Jinny danced that night. I knew her as a good dancer, but that night it was almost as if she were possessed by the ghost of Gillis. It wasn&#x2019;t even just her own dancing, though that was inspired. She did some moves that startled me, phrases so impressive she started to draw attention even on a crowded dance floor. Couples around us kept dancing, but began watching her. Her long red hair swirled through the room like the cape of an inspired toreador, and for a while I could only follow like a mesmerized bull. But then her eyes met mine, and flashed, and the next thing I knew I was attempting a combination I had never even thought of before; one that I knew as I began, was way beyond my abilities&#x2014;and I nailed it. She sent me a grin that felt like it started a sunburn, and offered me an intriguing move, and I thought of something to do with it, and she lobbed it back with a twist, and we got through five fairly complex phrases without a train wreck and out the other side as smoothly as if we&#x2019;d been rehearsing for weeks. Some people had stopped dancing to watch, now.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the way to the stars&#x2014;<br>every molecule in you was born in the heart of a star.<br>On the way to the stars&#x2014;<br>in the dead of the night they&#x2019;re the light that&#x2019;ll show<br>where you are<br>yes they are<br>from so far . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>In the back of my head were a few half-formed, half-baked layman&#x2019;s ideas for dance steps that I wasn&#x2019;t even sure were physically possible in a one-gee field. I&#x2019;d never had the nerve to actually try any of them with a partner, in any gravity; I really hate looking ridiculous. But Jinny lifted an eyebrow&#x2014;what have you got?&#x2014;and before I knew it I was trying one, even though there was no way she could know what her response was supposed to be. Only she did, somehow, and made it&#x2014;or rather, an improved variation of what I&#x2019;d thought of&#x2014;and not only was the result successful enough to draw applause, by luck it happened to offer a perfect lead-in to another of my ideas, which also turned out to work, and suggested something to her&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>We flew.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#x2019;ll be through if the day ever comes when we no<br>longer yearn to return to the stars.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can&#x2019;t prove it&#x2019;s so, but I&#x2019;m certain: I know<br>that our ancestors came from the stars.<br>&nbsp;<br>It would not be so lonely to die if I knew<br>I had died on the way to the stars.<br>&nbsp;<br>Talking about dance is as silly as dancing about architecture. I don&#x2019;t know how to convey exactly how we danced that night, or what was so remarkable about it. I can barely manage to believe we did it. Just let it stand that we deserved the applause we received when the music finally ended and we went into our closing clinch. It was probably the first time since I&#x2019;d come to Terra that I didn&#x2019;t feel heavy and weak and fragile. I felt strong . . . graceful . . . manly. . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;After dancing like that, Stinky, a couple really ought to get married,&#x201d; Jinny said about two hundred millimeters below my ear.<br>&nbsp;<br>I felt fourteen. &#x201c;Damn it, Jinny&#x2014;&#x201d; I said, and pulled away from her. I reached down for her hands, trying to make it into a dance move, but she eluded me. Instead she curtsied, blew me a kiss, turned on her heel, and left at high speed, to spirited applause.<br>&nbsp;<br>It increased when I ran after her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jinny was 178 centimeters tall, not especially tall for a Terran, and I was a Ganymedean beanpole two full meters high, so her legs were considerably shorter than mine. But they were also adapted from birth to a one-gee field&#x2014;to sports in a one-gee field. I didn&#x2019;t catch up with her until we&#x2019;d reached the parking lot, and then only because she decided to let me.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we&#x2019;d each had time to work on our lines.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ginny went with, &#x201c;Joel Johnston, if you don&#x2019;t want to marry me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Jinny, you know perfectly well I&#x2019;m going to marry you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In five more frimpin&#x2019; years! My God, Stinky, I&#x2019;ll be an old, old woman by then&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Skinny, you&#x2019;ll never be an old woman,&#x201d; I said, and that shut her up for a second. Every so often a good one comes to me like that. Not often enough. &#x201c;Look, don&#x2019;t be like this. I can&#x2019;t marry you right now. You know I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything of the sort. I know you won&#x2019;t. But I see nothing preventing you. You don&#x2019;t even have to worry about parental consent.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What does that have to do with it? Neither do you. And we wouldn&#x2019;t let parental disapproval stand in our way if we did want to get married.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You see? I was right&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t want to!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was becoming alarmed. I had always thought of Jinny as unusually rational, for a girl. Could this be one of those hormonal storms I had read about? I hoped not&#x2014;all authorities seemed to agree the only thing a man could do in such weather was lash himself to the mast and pray. I made a last stubborn attempt to pour logic on the troubled waters. &#x201c;Jinny, please&#x2014;be reasonable! I am not going to let you marry a dole bludger. Not even if he&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I intend to be a composer. You know that. That means it&#x2019;s going to take me at least a few years to even start to get established. You knew that when we started dating. If, I say &#x2018;if,&#x2019; all those bullocks I sacrificed to Zeus pay off and I actually win a Kallikanzaros Scholarship, it will be my great privilege to spend the next four years living on dishrag soup and scraped fridge, too poor to support a cat. If, and I say &#x2018;if,&#x2019; I am as smart as I think I am, and luckier than I usually am, I&#x2019;ll come out the other end with credentials that might, in only another year or two, leave me in a position to offer you something more than half of a motel cubicle. Meanwhile, you have your own scholarships and your law degree to worry about, so that once my music starts making serious money, nobody will weasel it away from us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Stinky, do you think I care about money?&#x201d; She said that last word as if it were a synonym for stale excrement.<br>&nbsp;<br>I sighed. Definitely a hormonal storm. &#x201c;Reboot and start over. What is the purpose of getting married?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What a romantic question!&#x201d; She turned away and quested for her car. I didn&#x2019;t move.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Quit dodging, I&#x2019;m serious. Why don&#x2019;t we just live together if we want to be romantic? What is marriage for?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The car told her she was heading the wrong way; she reversed direction and came back past me toward its voice and pulsing beacon. &#x201c;Babies, obviously.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I followed her. &#x201c;Bingo. Marriage is for making jolly babies, raising them up into successful predators, and then admiring them until they&#x2019;re old enough to reward you with grandchildren to spoil.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#x2019;d acquired the car by now; she safed and unlocked it. &#x201c;My baby-making equipment is at its peak right now,&#x201d; she said, and got in the car. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to start declining any minute.&#x201d; She closed, but did not slam, the door.<br>&nbsp;<br>I got in my side and strapped in. &#x201c;And the decline will take decades to become significant,&#x201d; I pointed out logically. &#x201c;Your baby-making gear may be at its hypothetical optimum efficiency today&#x2014;but my baby-raising equipment isn&#x2019;t even operational yet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Jinny, are you seriously proposing that we raise a child as extraordinary and gifted as ours on credit?&#x201d; We both shared a most uncommon aversion to being in debt. Orphans spend too much of their childhood in debt to others&#x2014;debt that cannot be repaid.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nobody seems to be seriously proposing around here,&#x201d; she said bitterly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hormonal hurricane, maybe. A long time ago they used to name all hurricanes after women. On Ganymede, we still named all groundquakes after them. &#x201c;Look&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She interrupted, &#x201c;Silver: my home, no hurry.&#x201d; The car said, &#x201c;Yes, Jinny,&#x201d; and came alive, preparing for takeoff.<br>&nbsp;<br>I wondered as always why she&#x2019;d named her car that&#x2014;if you were going to pick an element, I thought, why not hydrogen? I failed to notice the slight change in address protocol. Despite our low priority, we didn&#x2019;t have to wait long, since nobody else had left the prom yet and the system was between rush hours; Silver rose nearly at once and entered the system with minimal huhu. That early in the evening, most of the traffic was still in the other direction, into Greater Vancouver. Once our speed steadied, Jinny opaqued the windows, swiveled her seat to face me, and folded her arms. I&#x2019;m sure it was quite coincidental that this drew my attention to the area immediately above them. I believe in the Tooth Fairy, too. &#x201c;Pardon me for interrupting you,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked awfully good. Her prom dress was more of a spell than a garment. The soft warm interior lighting was very good to her. Of course, it was her car.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the hell of it. I wanted to marry her at least as much as she wanted to marry me. Just looking at her made my breath catch in my throat. I wished with all my heart, and not for the first time, that we lived back when unmarried people could live together openly. They said a stable society was impossible, back then. But even if they were right, what&#x2019;s so great about a stable society?<br>&nbsp;<br>My pop used to say, &#x201c;Joel, never pass up a chance to shut up.&#x201d; Well, some men learn by listening, some read, some observe and analyze&#x2014;and some of us just have to pee on the electric fence. &#x201c;Jinny, you know I&#x2019;m a backward colonial when it comes to debt.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And you know I feel the same way about it that you do!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I blinked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s true. We&#x2019;ve talked about it. I don&#x2019;t care what anybody says; becoming the indentured servant of something as compassionate and merciful as a bank or credit union simply isn&#x2019;t rational.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I spread my hands. &#x201c;What am I missing? Raising a child takes money&#x2014;packets and crates of the stuff. I haven&#x2019;t got it. I can&#x2019;t earn it. I won&#x2019;t borrow it. And I&#x2019;m too chicken to steal it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She broke eye contact. &#x201c;Those aren&#x2019;t the only ways to get it,&#x201d; she muttered. Silver gave its vector-change warning peep, slowed slightly, and banked left to follow the Second Narrows Bridge across Burrard Inlet.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So? I suppose I could go to Vegas and turn a two-credit bit into a megasolar at the roulette wheel.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Blackjack,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The other games are for suckers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My tenants back home on the Rock might strike ice. In the next ten minutes I could get an idea for a faster-than-light star drive that can be demonstrated without capital. I can always stand at stud, but that would kick me up a couple of tax brackets. Nothing else comes to mind.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She said nothing, very loudly. Silver peeped, turned left again, and increased speed, heading for the coast.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Look, Spice,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you know I don&#x2019;t share contemporary Terran prejudices any more than you do&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t insist that I be the one to support us. But somebody has to. If you can find a part-time job for either of us that pays well enough to support a family, we&#x2019;ll get married tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>No response. We both knew the suggestion was rhetorical. Two full-time jobs would barely support a growing family in the present economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;we already had this conversation once. Remember? That night on Luckout Hill?&#x201d; The official name is Lookout Hill, because it looks out over the ocean, but it&#x2019;s such a romantic spot, many a young man has indeed lucked out there. Not me, unfortunately. &#x201c;We said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I remember what we said!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, then, maybe I didn&#x2019;t. To settle it, I summoned that conversation up in my mind&#x2014;or at least fast-forwarded through the storyboard version in the master index. And partway through, I began to grow excited. There was indeed one contingency we had discussed that night on Luckout Hill, one that I hadn&#x2019;t really thought of again, since I couldn&#x2019;t really picture Jinny opting for it. I wasn&#x2019;t sure she was suggesting it now . . . but if she wasn&#x2019;t, I would.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;See here, Skinny, you really want to change your name from Hamilton to Johnston right away? Then let&#x2019;s do it tomorrow morning&#x2014;and ship out on the Sheffield!&#x201d; Her jaw dropped; I pressed on. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;re going to start our marriage broke, then let&#x2019;s do it somewhere where being broke isn&#x2019;t a handicap, or even a stigma&#x2014;out there around a new star, on some new world eighty light-years away, not here on Terra. What do you say? You say you&#x2019;re an old-fashioned girl&#x2014;will you homestead with me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A look passed across her face I&#x2019;d seen only once before&#x2014;on Aunt Tula&#x2019;s face, when they told us my father was gone. Sadness unspeakable. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Joel.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>How had I screwed...</p><h2>Rogue Warrior: Blood Lies (Rogue Warrior, 16)</h2><p><p>When the daughter of a retired Navy SEAL is kidnapped and held for ransom in Mexico, the Rogue Warrior and his band of Red Cell International warriors head south of the border to rescue her.

Walk down the wrong street, flash some cash, act a little tipsy&#x2014;before you know it, you&#x2019;ve got a crowd lining up behind you, fighting over who has dibs.<br>Getting kidnapped is harder. First of all, it pays to be choosey. You don&#x2019;t want to be kidnapped by just anyone. Or let me say, you don&#x2019;t want to be kidnapped by the <i>wrong</i> anyone. The crime has to be seen as a business transaction, not one of passion. Passion will quickly get you killed, not just in Juarez but anywhere.<br>It also has to be the right kind of business transaction. You don&#x2019;t want it to be part of a merger and acquisition. The latter is pretty common in Juarez, where drug cartels and their various factions are constantly jostling for position. If your kidnappers grab you as part of a hostile takeover, your chances of emerging with significant limbs intact is small.<br>You want to be kidnapped by someone who doesn&#x2019;t see you as competition, who expects a good ransom, and who knows that damaged goods are bad for business. He should be fairly adept at it, too&#x2014;the last thing you want is a nervous finger on the 1911 Model knockoff when it&#x2019;s pushed against your ribs. (Most kidnappers in general are male, and this is especially true in Mexico. I&#x2019;m not sure why they gravitate toward inexpensive versions of the venerable Colt automatic; maybe they get a bulk discount. Or maybe they missed out on our ATF royally fucked-up scam&#x2014;excuse me, <i>sting</i> operation&#x2014;&#x201c;designed&#x201d; to trace U.S. illegal gun sales throughout the Southwest, Midwest, and dead West. It was your typical cocked-up brain-dead government operation, helped along by some greedy cock breaths on the U.S. side of the border.)<br>If you want to be grabbed by higher-end thugs, you have to position yourself just right. Attractive and available alone won&#x2019;t cut it. Your cover story has to fall close to the profile of people they like to snatch. You also have to present yourself as easy, but not such a patsy that lesser villains try to pick you off the street.<br>Becoming functional bait isn&#x2019;t just a difficult business, it&#x2019;s an art form.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>My interest in kidnapping was sincere and honorable. I wanted to be grabbed as part of a plan to free a legitimate kidnap victim, the twenty-two-year-old, tactfully blond and delicately curvaceous daughter of a fellow SEAL.<br>There were ulterior motives as well, the most important of which had to do with Hezbollah1 and a reported terror camp in the border area. But that part of the story is best saved for a moment when things are a little calmer. Because at the moment this book begins, I&#x2019;m east of Juarez being chased by a pair of pickup trucks filled with gun-toting banditos. My foot is to the floor and the big Cadillac is fishtailing across a sandy Mexican road parallel to the border.<br>The car responded by pulling to the left, the torque steer nearly jerking her out of my hands. Careful not to overcorrect, I muscled the vehicle onto the pavement, holding the nose steady as the speedometer stretched toward triple digits.<br>I&#x2019;m not ordinarily a Cadillac guy; if I were going to choose a car from Government Motors at all it would probably be more in the Chevy line. But this Caddy had a lot going for it&#x2014;most especially the ceramic plate inserts throughout the chassis and body designed to withstand anything short of a 120 mm armor-piercing shell. The glass&#x2014;front, back, and sides&#x2014;had been replaced with thick bulletproof material, all of which added a shitpot of extra weight to this lead sled. In exchange, the armor could ward off slugs from a .300 Win mag.<br>Unfortunately, the bastards behind me opened fire with a pair of fifties&#x2014;as in 50 mm machine guns. The bullets, heavier and designed to act like frickin&#x2019; can openers, peppered the back of the car. A dozen shattered the window, embedding themselves in the ceramic plates in the driver&#x2019;s seat behind me.<br>I ducked as low as I could, trying to hide behind what was left of the seat as bullets splattered through the interior of the car, smashing the burled walnut interior accents and adding random vents to the automatic climate control. The front windshield spiderwebbed with bullet holes, and the radio, which had been playing an old Willie Nelson tune about cowboys, gave up the ghost.<br>That was pretty much the last straw. I veered right, then reached for the flasher button.<br>The button was preset to send a radio signal to my trail team; roughly translated, the signal meant &#x201c;Get your fucking butts over here and rescue my ass.&#x201d; Only not as polite.<br>In theory, I didn&#x2019;t need the signal: we had a small UAV overhead watching, sending signals to a temporary command post and the trail team. But theory and reality had already separated: in <i>theory</i> the gang I was enticing as a kidnap victim didn&#x2019;t fire at its victims. In reality, the bastards behind me were about to fry me alive.<br>I swung left and right, onto the shoulders, then back to the highway. As I came up over a rise, I spotted a tractor-trailer headed in my direction and moving at a good clip. I waited until he had pulled almost even, then swerved my car, sliding off the road behind him but managing to regain the pavement in the opposite direction of my pursuers.2<br>Somewhere between the bullets and the hard turn, two of my four tires blew out. That didn&#x2019;t slow me down too much, since they were run-flats (or more accurately &#x201c;run while shot to shit&#x201d; flats), but I strongly suspect there was a connection between the blowouts and the stench of burning rubber that began filling the cabin.<br>At least I didn&#x2019;t have to worry about ventilation. I kept my foot firmly on the floor, heading in the direction of the pickup truck with the first half of my trail team, Shotgun and Mongoose, aka Paul &#x201c;Shotgun&#x201d; Fox and Thomas &#x201c;Mongoose&#x201d; Yamya. Somewhere to the east, behind me now, was another vehicle with two more of my shooters, Trace Dahlgren and Tommy &#x201c;Tex&#x201d; Reeves. Both halves were undoubtedly heading at high speed to my rescue. I thought <i>eventually</i> they were going to converge and help get me the hell out of this mess.3<br>Unfortunately, it didn&#x2019;t look like I was going to reach <i>eventually</i>. As I approached the back of the tractor-trailer, the tailgate rolled up, revealing another machine gun.<br>It began peppering the pavement in front of my car with bullets. I pulled the wheel hard right, taking the car off-road. The Caddy&#x2019;s front end had been carefully reinforced, but even a Bradley Fighting Vehicle would have buckled under the strain. What was left of the windshield disintegrated; steam started shooting from the hood area. I lost the rest of the tires and struggled to keep the car moving, wrestling with it as it wove and bucked in a drunken, smoky swirl.<br>Flames flicked from the floor. I had two options:<br>a) get the hell out of the car or<br>b) start a second career as a burn-center test dummy.<br>I chose a).<br>The car, against all common sense and probably the laws of physics and motion, was still moving at a very good pace; jumping would have been even more suicidal than staying. We careened back toward the road, then swirled sideways and slid down a washboard gully flanking the macadam. Sparks flew as the rims and chassis hit the asphalt, rebounded across the highway, then spun onto the soft desert sand and came to a stop.<br>I wish I could have said the same for my head, which was turning revolutions so fast it felt like it was trying to unscrew itself. By the time I managed to get my seat belt undone and the door open, I was engulfed in a thick, inky fog of smoke and fire. I coughed like a three-pack-a-day smoker, falling to my knees on the ground. I started crawling toward daylight.<br>The tractor-trailer stopped catty-corner across the road about seventy-five yards ahead. The machine-gun fire had stopped. For a moment I thought the smoke might give me enough cover so I could hide in the desert until my people arrived; surely they&#x2019;d be along any second now.<br>Then something flew out of the back of the trailer. It looked like a fastball thrown by Nolan Ryan during his heyday, but it was even more explosive&#x2014;a 40 mm grenade.<br>It sailed well off the mark, a good seventy yards or more over my head: right into one of the kidnappers&#x2019; pickup trucks. The driver tried veering at the last moment, but all he succeeded in doing was tipping the vehicle as the grenade hit. It toppled over impressively.<br>I scrambled to my feet and began running to the south, trying to get behind as much of the drifting cloud of haze and smoke as I could. A second grenade flashed overhead, exploding a little closer than the other.<br>Murphy,4 or his close cousin, Dumb Luck, smiled on me at that moment, sending a tourist bus down the highway. The bus driver, driving like the attentive, cautious man most are, was doing close to ninety and didn&#x2019;t realize the truck wasn&#x2019;t going to get out of the way until he was too close to stop. He hit the horn, slammed on the brakes, and then power-steered off the road, trying to swerve around it. He nearly made it&nbsp;... until the rear quarter panel of the bus came back and clipped the front fender of the truck.<br>The bus tumbled and the trailer slammed sideways just as the grenadier fired another round. I jumped up and ran, heading toward a wide ditch a hundred or so yards off the road. Sliding in, I took as long a breath as I dared, then started down it to the east, trying to put as much distance between me and the artillery as possible.<br>Unfortunately, the plan to have myself kidnapped had left me without a personal weapon; even businesslike kidnappers tend to think the worst when they spot a gun. There was a small radio device in my belt transmitting my location, and I also had a special phone imbedded in the heel of my boot.5 But aside from my fists and my...</p><h2>Power Down (A Dewey Andreas Novel)</h2><p><p><i>Introducing a major new thriller writer--in the vein of Vince Flynn and Brad Thor--and an electrifying character, Dewey Andreas.</i></p><p>A major North American hydroelectric dam is blown up and the largest off-shore oil field in this hemisphere is destroyed in a brutal, coordinated terrorist attack.

Mann's social history of gay Hollywood, a treasure trove of fresh anecdotes and observations of a period and place in which homosexuals enjoyed tremendous freedom and influence--within certain obvious limits. In choosing subjects for his study, Mann cast his net widely, hauling in a great number of uncelebrated but essential workers in the "queer" areas of the film industry--mainly costume design and props, but also writing, directing and acting. This is not principally a look at famous figures, in other words, but at a subculture as a whole, in which Dorothy Arzner, George Cukor, and Charles Laughton are just part of larger circles of gay life and work. Certain to become essential to gay film studies, <i>Behind the Scenes</i> provides a rich, accessible history of pre-Stonewall Hollywood. <i>--Regina Marler</i>William J.

The early sections deal with his upbringing as a slave and his efforts to get an education. Washington details his transition from student to teacher, and outlines his own development as an educator and founder of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. In the final chapters of <b>Up From Slavery</b>, Washington describes his career as a public speaker and civil rights activist.</p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

He shows how spirituality today combines the enlightenment of the East, which excels at cultivating higher states of consciousness, with the enlightenment of the West, which offers developmental and psychodynamic psychology. Each contributes key components to a more integral spirituality. </p><p> <br>On the basis of this integral framework, a radically new role for the world&#x2019;s religions is proposed. Because these religions have such a tremendous influence on the worldview of the majority of the earth&#x2019;s population, they are in a privileged position to address some of the biggest conflicts we face. By adopting a more integral view, the great religions can act as facilitators of human development: from magic to mythic to rational to pluralistic to integral&#x2014;and to a global society that honors and includes all the stations of life along the way.</p></p><p><p>Ken Wilber is the author of over twenty books. He is the founder of Integral Institute, a think-tank for studying integral theory and practice, with outreach through local and online communities such as Integral Education Network, Integral Training, and Integral Spiritual Center.</p>"Even the timid first-timer can penetrate and be rewarded by <i>Integral Spirituality</i>."&#x2014;<i>Shambhala Sun</i> <p> &#x201c;Ken Wilber&#x2019;s <i>Integral Spirituality </i>is possibly the most important spiritual book in postmodern times.

Reprint.</p><p>The descent by a group of egocentric, flamboyant filmmakers on a small town has been the setup for a number of novels and a few movies. Rhys Bowen takes her crack at it with a tidy little story about a group of documentarians who invade a small village in Wales to capture the raising of a sunken German bomber on film. Llanfair is surrounded by abandoned mineshafts, and when the bombastic producer Grantley Smith is found murdered in one of them, Constable Evan Evans, Bowen's series hero, stumbles down more than a few dead ends before he uncovers the motive. Finding evidence of a stash of paintings from the National Gallery that were hidden at the scene of the murder, Evan uncovers a decades-old plot involving art forgery that doesn't really have much to do with the murder except coincidence. It does, however, keep the narrative moving, as does a love affair between the constable and the schoolteacher, who turns out to have been married to one of the filmmakers. All's well that ends well--except, probably, for the unfortunate title punning to which Bowen (<i>Evan Help Us</i>, <i>Evanly Choirs</i>, and so forth) seems addicted. <i>--Jane Adams</i>With Evan Can Wait I wanted to write a book that showed more depth and breadth than the previous books in the series. I wanted to reveal Evan&#39;s emotions and to spread the tale onto a broader canvas. What started off as a brief interview with old Trefor Thomas, who worked in the slate mine during the war, became one of the main threads of the book. Trefor just took over the story and wouldn&#39;t go away. When I had finished I realized that I had two parallel tales--fifty years apart--the stories mirror images of each other to an alarming degree. Very satisfying--for my readers too, I hope.</p><h2>A Fairy Friend</h2><p><p>Soar into an enchanting miniature world full of fairies.

Because the Jewish New Testament expresses its original and essential Jewishness. <p>The New Testament is a Jewish book--by Jews, mostly about Jews, and for Jews as well as Gentiles. Its central figure, the Messiah Yeshua (Jesus), was and is a Jew. Vicarious atonement, salvation, immersion (baptism), the new covenant and the very concept of a Messiah are all Jewish. In sum, the New Testament is built upon and completes the Hebrew Scriptures. </p><p>The Jewish New Testament brings out Jewishness in three ways: </p><p>- Cosmetically--by using neutral terms and Hebrew names: "execution-stake," not "cross"; "Ya'akov," not "James." <br>- Culturally and Religiously--by highlighting Jewish features: "Chanukkah," not "the feast of dedication"; "tzitzit," not "fringe." <br>- Theologically--by correcting mistranslations resulting from anti-Jewish theological bias; for example, at Romans 10:4 the Messiah is "the goal at which the Torah aims," not "the end of the law." </p><p>Freshly rendered from the original Greek into enjoyable modern English by a Messianic Jew (a Jew who honors Yeshua as the Messiah of Israel), the "Jewish New Testament" challenges Jews to understand that Yeshua is a friend to every Jewish heart and the New Testament a Jewish book filled with truths to be accepted and acted upon. At the same time, while reaffirming the equality of Gentiles and Jews in the Messianic Community, it challenges Christians to acknowledge the Jewishness of their faith and their oneness with the Jewish people.</p></p><p>David H.

He played arenas and stadiums, he had platinum records and made his fortune, but he was never magnificently cool like Lennon, darkly beautiful like Elvis, implacably enigmatic like Dylan, or three-quarters crazy like a hundred others. Style, roguishness, bad behavior, self-conscious unpredictability were never his tools. Modest in manner, he did not boast a mysterious background or invent one for himself. He came with less rock and roll packaging and tiresome self-invention than anyone in the business. And one effect of time has been to show how little the absence of theatricality mattered. Paul Simon's songs have become a part of life's fabric, an inner walking-around music. You stroll around New York and hear the echoes of his loneliness, his comedy, his passion, his ache, and his growing older. Even now, as he writes new songs and immerses himself in yet another song form and rhythmic realm, he has secured his place in musical history. Simon stands with both the unpretentious masters of his own youth -- the Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson -- and his greatest predecessors: Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, Rodgers &amp; Hart, the Gershwins, Johnny Mercer, and Cole Porter. As you browse through this book, the enormous (and unfinished) catalog of Paul Simon's art, you will see just how many songs he's written that rate with "How Deep Is the Ocean" and "Stormy Weather."</p> <p>You undoubtedly know the story: Simon was born in Newark in 1941. He was raised in Kew Garden Hills, a middle-class area of Queens. His mother was an English teacher. His father was a professional bassist, but for a long time Paul had a limited interest in music. At a school production of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> he became friends with Art Garfunkel -- Paul was the White Rabbit, Art the Cheshire Cat -- and, together with two sisters, Angel and Ida Pelligrini, they formed an a cappella group and sang doo-wop songs. Dispensing with the Pelligrinis, the two boys performed as Tom &amp; Jerry and wrote an ebullient pop song called "Hey Schoolgirl," which became a hit in 1957 for Big Records. As teenagers they were famous, appearing on a bill with Jerry Lee Lewis on Dick Clark's <i>American Bandstand</i>. In 1964, with Dylan and The Beatles now in full flower, and with college and years of apprentice work now behind them, the two young men re�??formed in full ethnic name (a rarity at the time) as Simon &amp; Garfunkel, with Paul providing the songs and melodies and Art the harmonies. Their first LP, <i>Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.</i> featured "The Sound of Silence," a number one hit on the American charts.</p> <p>Many of Simon's earliest songs were the songs of a very young man, full of longing and self-exploration. The best of them -- "The Sound of Silence," "Homeward Bound," "America" -- are tender, anthemic, and inventive, but there was also a quality in Simon's early work, often overlooked, of New York wit. It was not the scornful and scabrous finger-pointing style of "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" and "It Ain't Me, Babe," but a wry, gentler species of social comedy. In "The Dangling Conversation," Simon parodies a certain kind of wised-up Manhattan conversation in rapid quotation even as he expresses his sense of lost love:</p> <blockquote> Yes, we speak of things that matter <br>With words that must be said <br>"Can analysis be worthwhile?" <br>"Is the theater really dead?" <br>And how the room has softly faded <br>And I only kiss your shadow <br>I cannot feel your hand <br>You're a stranger now unto me <br>Lost in the dangling conversation <br>And the superficial sighs <br>In the borders of our lives </blockquote> <p>What a book like this neglects, unless you have a particularly acute memory and encyclopedic ear, is the musicality of the songs. The danger of such a book is that it seems to ask the reader to consider the lyrics as verse, written for the page. But even the best songs, Simon's included, are utterly linked to the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic qualities that go along with them. Simon was always a voracious consumer of songs and varieties of music -- he would eventually combine forces with forms and players from New Orleans, Jamaica, Africa, Brazil, and elsewhere -- but he was also a reader of English verse: W.B. Yeats, Wallace Stevens, Seamus Heaney, Philip Larkin, and, of course, his collaborator on <i>The Capeman</i>, Derek Walcott. He does not pretend to imitate those poets, but it is clear that he learned from them -- their imagery and economy -- as surely as he did from his musical forebears.</p> <p>Take a song like "Duncan." Simon constructs a complicated narrative with incredible speed. Right away we get an autoportrait of the self-pitying boy in a cheap hotel room whose misery is compounded by the insatiably athletic couple in the next room ("Bound to win a prize"). We get his backstory in a few lines: the son of a fisherman and a "a fisherman's friend" ("And I was born in the boredom/And the chowder"). Penniless and on his own, he meets a preacher-girl, and, after the service, he creeps into her tent: "And my long years of innocence ended." Now, as an older man, he remembers that awakening with pleasure and gratitude as he plays his guitar under the stars: "Just thanking the Lord/For my fingers." </p> <p>Although Simon first started writing hit songs in an era that had a tendency to mistake portentousness for meaning, his songs valued patient construction and a clear-as-gin transparency. This seems to be a conscious way of working for Simon. In 1990, when he was old enough to look back on his working method, he told an interviewer, Paul Zollo, "The easier it is for people to understand, the better it is, I think. As long as you're not sacrificing intelligence or insight or feeling in order to make it easier. If you can capture something that you feel is real and express it in a way that a lot of people can understand, that's rare and there's something about that that makes a piece have a certain kind of life. And if it enters into popular culture and it's not just about popular culture, then from a writer's point of view, that's a satisfying achievement."</p> <p>Even as Simon's musical and rhythmical goals became increasingly complex, particularly with the <i>Graceland</i> album, his lyrical strategy retained its determined patience. "You Can Call Me Al" begins like a "three-guys-walk-into-a-bar" gambit: "A man walks down the street." And he begins to ask himself why he is "soft in the middle" when the rest of his life is so hard. Simple as that: a man in the throes.</p> <p>"You have to be a good host to people's attention span," Simon explained. "They're not going to come in there and work real hard right away. Too many things are coming: the music is coming, the rhythm is coming, all kinds of information that the brain is sorting out." In this song and many others, the more abstract or ornate images come later, but the listener is prepared because by now "those abstract images, they will just come down and fall into one of the slots that the mind has already made up about the structure of the song." A similar thing, with a different tactic, happens in the title song, "Graceland," which opens with a clear simile: "The Mississippi Delta/Was shining like a National guitar." A National guitar, of course, is a steel-topped instrument that gleams like water. Two quick lines and we have entered a new world.</p> <p>With time, many songs and their performers grow dated, as faintly ridiculous as an old fashion, a preposterous hat. We wonder, How could we have ever loved that? Simon's restless searching into himself, into forms of music undreamed of by the Everly Brothers, has been ambitious but always honest and unprepossessing. Maybe that is why Simon's best songs, whether sung by himself or by his most distinguished interpreters (think of Aretha Franklin on "Bridge Over Troubled Water"), do not date.</p> <p>In the last pages of this book, you will encounter the songs of a writer no longer young, no longer at the top of the Billboard charts, but whose capacity for feeling and thought compressed into song has only deepened. In his maturity, he considers even the hardest thing with the serenity of the psalm writers. In "Quiet," Paul Simon is decades past youth, yet eager for the next chapter:</p> <blockquote> I am heading for a time of quiet <br>When my restlessness is past <br>And I can lie down on my blanket <br>And release my fists at last... <br>And I am heading for a place of quiet <br>Where the sage and sweet grass grow <br>By a lake of sacred water <br>From the mountain's melted snow. </blockquote> <p> -- David Remnick<br>New York, New YorkIntroduction copyright � 2008 by David Remnick</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b>FOREWORD</b></p> <p>If the experiences of people like me, who grew up in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, had been the subject of a movie, Paul Simon would have written the soundtrack of our lives. In fact, for the forty-plus years of my professional life as an artist, every single painting that I have executed has been painted with Paul's music playing in the background.</p> <p>His music is appreciated by me, and probably the majority of his fans, just by letting his words and music wash over us as an experience -- and what a powerful, rich, and varied experience that can be. Musicians, however, tell me that for those who share his musical craft, their appreciation is special. No less a composer than Philip Glass has called Paul the greatest songwriter of our time. Other musicians comment on his innovative rhythmic shifts, which are often abrupt and unexpected, and his unique use of chord changes and melodic transitions. He is universally admired by musicians of every stripe and every generation.</p> <p>Artists are by nature generous in sharing their interest in and passion for the work of other artists of different generations and cultures. Think of Van Gogh and Japanese woodblock prints, Picasso and African tribal art, de Kooning and cubism, Warhol and advertising and pop culture.

The simple fact that cloth tightly compressed into wrinkles or folds resists the penetration of dye is an opportunity-an opportunity to let the pliancy of textiles speak in making designs and patterns. <br><br>People around the world have recognized this opportunity, producing resist designs in textiles by shaping and then securing cloth in various ways before dyeing. Yet in no other country has the creative potential of this basic principle been understood and applied as it has in Japan. Here, in fact, it has been expanded into a whole family of traditional resist techniques, involving first shaping the cloth by plucking, pinching, twisting, stitching, folding, pleating, and wrapping it, and then securing the shapes thus made by binding, looping, knotting, clamping, and the like. This entire family of techniques is called shibori. <br><br>Designs created with shibori processes all share a softness of outline and spontaneity of effect. Spontaneity is shibori's special magic, made possible by exploiting the beauty of the fortuitous things that happen when dye enters shaped cloth. <br><br>Usually it is in response to the fact that a craft is being lost that the need for preserving and documenting it arises. The motivation behind this book is no exception, but the authors have gone far beyond simple documentation. Extensive research and experimentation have led to the revival here of shibori techniques that were once well known but have now been largely forgotten in Japan. In addition to more conventional techniques, the work of contemporary fiber artists in Japan and abroad in shibori textile art and wearable art is presented, to suggest the extent of the creative innovation possible. <br><br>The 104 color and 298 black-and-white plates include a photographic Gallery of Shibori Examples, based on Japan's largest collection of traditional shibori fabrics. Included also are a detailed guide to basic natural dyes used in Japan, the making and care of an indigo vat, and a list of suppliers in North America, as well as a glossary and bibliography. Now available in paperback, this full documentation of one of the world's most inventive and exciting dyeing techniques continues as a classic in the textile field.</p><p>An artist, author, exhibition curator, textile researcher, and film producer, <b>Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada</b> has long been a proponent of traditional and sustainable practices in fashion and textile production.

The Alabama Leaves Fernando De Noronha For A Cruise On The Coast Of Brazil -- Enters The Great Highway And Begins To Overhaul The Travellers -- Capture Of The Whaler Nye; Of The Dorcas Prince; Of The Union Jack; Of The Sea Lark -- A Reverend Consul Taken Prisoner Alabama Goes Into Bahia -- What Occurred There -- Arrival Of The Georgia Alabama ProCeeds To Sea Again Captures The Following Ships: The Gilderslieve; The Justina; The JaBez Snow; The Amazonian, And The Talisman. THE 22d of April having arrived, we gave up all further hopes of the Agrippina, and went to sea. As we passed out of the roadstead, we cut adrift the four whale-boats which we had brought in from the captured whalers, rather than destroy them. They would be valuable, to the islanders, who had treated us kindly, and it was amusing to see the struggle which took place for the possession of them. The good people seemed to have some anticipation of what was to take place, and all the boatmen of the island had assembled to contest the prizes, in every description of craft that would float, from the dug-out to the tidy cutter. The boatmen stripped themselves like athletes for the fray, and as whale-boat after boat was cut adrift, there was a pulling and splashing, a paddling and a screaming that defy all description; the victors waving their hats, and shouting their victory and their good-bye to us, in the same breath. We steamed due east from the island some forty miles, when we let our steam go down, raised the propeller, and put the ship under sail. The Alabama, with full coal-bunkers and a refreshed crew, was again in pursuit of the enemy&#39;s commerce I had at last accomplished my cherished design -- which had been frustrated in the Sumter--of a cruise on the coast of Brazil....</p><p></p><h2>The House of God</h2><p>Humor, honesty, a little intrigue, human interest.</p><p></p><h2>Route 66: EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers - 3RD EDITION</h2><p>This third edition updates almost every page.

An excellent companion to this third edition is the publisher's Route 66 Dining &amp; Lodging Guide.</p><p>Noted Route 66 author, artist and historian, Jerry McClanahan has been mapping Route 66 since his family vacations during the 1960s, when he sat in the back seat of the family Ford, trying to draw his own crude map of the road. Born in Oklahoma in 1957, Jerry s family moved out to sunny Southern California in 1959 (sadly, they did NOT take Route 66). Then there followed a decade of wonderful journeys down the Mother Road, from California thru Oklahoma City. These back seat travels left an indelible mark on him, one that eventually came to color the whole fabric of his creativity. Jerry rediscovered Route 66 in 1981, when he and his father made a trip out west, stopping at everything this time. Since then, every year has found Jerry making numerous expeditions along the route, mapping, photographing and collecting information. In the early 1990s, Jerry began painting and writing about the Mother Road full time, enjoying a long stint as staff artist and a staff writer for Route 66 Magazine before moving on to write for the Federation News and American Road (where he is a department editor). In 1994, he collaborated with OK 66 expert Jim Ross on the best-selling Route 66 Map Series (which features his unofficial Route 66 mascot Rootie ), as well as the acclaimed Bones of the Old Road video (with Kathy Anderson). Jerry s photographs have appeared in numerous books and periodicals, while his paintings of old cars on Route 66 hang in private collections across the country and overseas. In 2008, Jerry moved to Chandler, Oklahoma, where he welcomes visitors to his art gallery, just a stone&#39;s throw off Route 66.</p><h2>FACE IT: A MEMOIR (HARDBACK)</h2><p><p><strong>A MULTILAYERED MEMOIR FROM A MULTIFACETED ARTIST</strong></p><p>As a musician, an actor, a muse, an icon, the breadth of Debbie Harry&#x2019;s impact on our culture has been matched by her almost Sphinx-like reticence about her inner life. Through it all &#x2013; while being acclaimed as one of the most beautiful women in the world, prized by a galaxy of leading photographers and fashion designers, beloved by legions of fans for her relentless, high-octane performances, selling 50 million albums or being painted by Andy Warhol &#x2013; Debbie Harry has infused her perennial Blondie persona with a heady mix of raw sexuality and sophisticated punk cool.</p><p>In <em>Face It</em>, Debbie Harry invites us into the complexity of who she is and how her life and career have played out over the last seven decades. Upending the standard music memoir, with a cutting-edge style keeping with the distinctive qualities of her multi-disciplined artistry, <em>Face It</em> includes a thoughtful introduction by Chris Stein, rare personal photos, original illustrations, fan artwork installations and more.</p><p>Peppered with colourful characters, <em>Face It</em> features everyone from bands Blondie came up with on the 1970s music scene &#x2013; The Ramones, Television, Talking Heads, Iggy Pop and David Bowie &#x2013; to artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Marina Abramovi&#x107; and H.R. Giger of <em>Alien</em> fame. It explores her successful acting career (she has starred in over 30 film roles, including David Cronenberg&#x2019;s <em>Videodrome</em> and John Waters&#x2019;s <em>Hairspray</em>), her weekends with William S. Burroughs and her attempted abduction by serial killer Ted Bundy. Ranging from the hardscrabble grit and grime of the early New York City years to times of glorious commercial success, interrupted by a plunge into heroin addiction, the near-death of partner Chris Stein, a heart-wrenching bankruptcy and Blondie&#x2019;s break-up as a band, an amazing solo career and then a stunning return with Blondie, this is a cinematic story of an artist who has always set her own path.</p><p>Inspirational, entertaining, shocking, humorous and eye-opening, <em>Face It</em> is a memoir as dynamic as its subject.</p></p><p></p><h2>Goosebumps #56: The Curse of Camp Cold Lake</h2><p>They're baa-ack!

At mealtimes he is seated at the &#x201c;cat&#x2019;s table&#x201d;&#x2014;as far from the Captain&#x2019;s Table as can be&#x2014;with a ragtag group of &#x201c;insignificant&#x201d; adults and two other boys, Cassius and Ramadhin. As the ship makes its way across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal, into the Mediterranean, the boys tumble from one adventure to another, bursting all over the place like freed mercury. But there are other diversions as well: One man talks with them about jazz and women, another opens the door to the world of literature. The narrator&#x2019;s elusive, beautiful cousin Emily becomes his confidante, allowing him to see himself &#x201c;with a distant eye&#x201d; for the first time, and to feel the first stirring of desire. Another cat&#x2019;s table denizen, the shadowy Miss Lasqueti, is perhaps more than what she seems. And very late every night, the boys spy on a shackled prisoner, his crime and his fate a galvanizing mystery that will haunt them forever. <br> &nbsp;<br> As the narrative moves between the decks and holds of the ship and the boy&#x2019;s adult years, it tells a spellbinding story&#x2014;by turns poignant and electrifying&#x2014;about the magical, often forbidden discoveries of childhood and a lifelong journey that begins unexpectedly with a spectacular sea voyage.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> Michael Ondaatje's finely wrought new novel chronicles a young boy's passage from Sri Lanka to London onboard the <em>Oronsay</em>, both as it unfolds and in hindsight. Glancing off the author's own biography, the story follows 11-year-old Michael as he immerses himself in the hidden corners and relationships of a temporary floating world, overcoming its physical boundaries with the expanse of his imagination. The boy's companions at the so-called cat's table, where the ship&#x2019;s unconnected strays dine together, become his friends and teachers, each leading him closer to the key that unlocks the <em>Oronsay</em>'s mystery decades later. Elegantly structured and completely absorbing, <em>The Cat's Table</em> is a quiet masterpiece by a writer at the height of his craft. <em>--Mia Lipman<br></em> <br> <p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Abraham Verghese on <em>The Cat's Table</em> by Michael Ondaatje</strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p>One means by which I have kept track of the passage of time is by the appearance of a new Michael Ondaatje book. I&#x2019;ve loved his poetry (and I still know long passages from <em>Secular Love</em> by heart). I love the way his books of poetry or prose, fiction or nonfiction (and some of his books are hybrids that seem to be <em>all</em> those genres in one book) are so carefully crafted. I must have read <em>In the Skin of a Lion</em> 10 times, disassembling it to see how this magic alchemy came about.</p> <p>You can imagine my excitement when <em>The Cat&#x2019;s Table</em>, Ondaatje&#x2019;s latest, arrived on my desk. I found myself reading aloud with a loved one, savoring, just a few pages a day that were carefully rationed. Reading aloud was a way to make every morsel last longer, have it linger on tongue and ear. I can&#x2019;t think of a book I&#x2019;ve read where the sense of a journey&#x2014;in this case, a ship going from Ceylon to England via the Suez Canal&#x2014;is so carefully mirrored in the reader&#x2019;s experience. I had the sense of movement, of a big ship inching away from the shore, and of seeing one&#x2019;s former life recede. At the assigned dinner table (from which the title derives), one meets fellow travelers and the brief bios they present to the world. With each passing day, the narrator finds that these constructed selves give way to something deeper, something overstated, or something dark and ominous, or at other times they modestly conceal a being that is incredibly beautiful and heroic. As the journey progresses, the many characters and the flavors each adds begin to meld together, and I had a sense of the narrative soup <em>thickening</em>, the pace increasing. Indeed, by the last few pages it was as though we had arrived all too soon at the bottom of a most delicious cioppino or bouillabaisse. The fleshy items were dispensed with, the shells all removed, leaving only those last few spoonfuls, and in them a wise world, a complete world, a world distilled. When it was over, I had that sense one lives for as a reader: the feeling of having discovered a truth not just about the imagined world of the novelist, but also about oneself, a truth one can now carry forth into the world, into the rest of one&#x2019;s life....</p> <p>Make haste to get this book, then do what I did: Fill up the tub, ration yourself to a few pages a day, read aloud, preferably to someone as crazy about Ondaatje as you are. Be disciplined. Don&#x2019;t exceed your ration. It is a long voyage but it will go by too soon. So relish.

The unity forced upon the warring nations by an alien enemy has shattered. Nations are rising again, seeking territory and influence, and most of all, seeking to control the skills and loyalty of the children from the Battle School.</p><p>But one person has a better idea. Peter Wiggin, Ender's older, more ruthless, brother, sees that any hope for the future of Earth lies in restoring a sense of unity and purpose. And he has an irresistible call on the loyalty of Earth's young warriors.

Now, the down-but-not-out evil genius is again scheming towards global domination and vengeance against the irrepressible Bean. It's up to Bean and his newfound love, Petra, to outwit the young psychopath and save the world. Meanwhile, the other Battle School children are called to serve again as an expansionist China threatens the stability of post-Bugger War Earth.</p><p> <i>Shadow Puppets</i> is, for better or worse, exactly what readers have come to expect from Card. There are thought-provoking musings on geopolitics, war, courage, arrogance, good versus evil, and the concept of children wise beyond their years dealing with grave responsibility. Unfortunately, many of these furnishings are looking a little frayed around the edges, but fans will enjoy an exciting, fast-paced plot and a suspense-filled conclusion. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p><p><b>Orson Scott Card</b> is best known for his science fiction novel <i>Ender's Game</i> and it's many sequels that expand the Ender Universe into the far future and the near past.

In the clear inspiring language that made him a favourite of Popes and lay faithful alike he explains: How the Mysteries of Jesus are now our mysteries - springs of living water we are meant to drink from.

No other instruction is so luminous, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so perfectly adapted to the intelligence of the faithful as the prayers of the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liturgy.

Nick Slate has moved to Colorado Springs with his father and brother after a fire destroyed their home and killed his mom. Their new home turns out to be the home of Nikola Tesla, a quirky inventor. The attic is filled with Tesla's inventions, which Nick sells. All these items have some sort of strange power. He and his new friends try to figure out what is going on and get everything back. They discover the Accelerati, a secret group, and life becomes even more dangerous. The writing is fun and exciting and the plot is unpredictable. The action keeps going until the climactic ending. This is an action-filled book with humor sprinkled throughout; science fiction and mystery lovers will enjoy it. Melinda W. Miller, K-12 Library Media Specialist, Colton-Pierrepont Central School, Colton, New York Recommended Library Media Connection"<br><br>Following the death of his mother in a house fire, Nick Slate moves with his father and brother to Colorado Springs, taking up residence in the down-at-the-heels house of a deceased relative. Nick has two immediate goals: to stay under the radar at his new middle school, and to make some quick cash by selling attic junk at a garage sale. Goal one is a non-starter when garrulous classmate Mitch takes Nick loudly under his wing, but goal two is unbelievably successful, especially once Nick turns on an antique lamp that seems to draw customers who bid up the prices on the castoffs. When the appliances begin acting strangely all over Colorado Springs and shady adults clad in pearlized suits take sinister interest in Nick, he discovers that his distant auntie had been Nikola Tesla's fancy lady, and he deduces that the bits and bobs now scattered over the city fit together into a mysterious but potent machine. This surely sounds like the storyline to any number of novels already on the shelf, and even Tesla has become a bit too ubiquitous of late, but Shusterman and Elfman have crafted a plot more devious, characters far quirkier, climaxes (yes, there are two) more breathless, and a narration much, much funnier than recent mad-science offerings. Sticking with a third-person narration frees the authors to be as wryly and sophisticatedly witty as they please without compromising the veracity of their middle-school cast, resulting in storytelling as delightful as the story being told. At the end of the first book in a planned trilogy, Tesla's invention has wrought some serious damage, and Nick and friends are off to reanimate a dearly departed pal. If that won't bring back readers for Volume Two, what will? EB BCCB"<br><br>After his mother dies in a house fire, fourteen-year-old Nick, his younger brother Danny, and their father move into Great-aunt Greta's old house. Finding the attic full of junk, Nick spearheads a garage sale where, much to his surprise, patrons seem compelled to make purchases. Along with new friends Caitlin, Mitch, and Vince, Nick eventually finds that the items-which all seem to have mysterious powers-were made by Nicola Tesla himself. One of those items, a baseball glove, appears to contain its own magnetic pull, but when it begins yanking small meteorites out of orbit, a shady collection of self-proclaimed scientists called the Accelerati starts snooping around. What no one realizes is that one of the meteorites attracted by the magical mitt is big enough to destroy the Earth. Now Nick and his friends are in a race to save humanity while avoiding the (nefarious) Accelerati. The strong narrative voice propels the well-paced story, and while the plotting is shaky at times, future installments may very well clear up the problem spots. Although they rely heavily on action and adventure, the authors don't skimp on character development: Nick is a likable protagonist; his friends are a varied and humorous bunch. With a dynamic mix of secret-society intrigue, quirky gadgetry, appealing teen characters, and humor, this series has the makings of a hit. sam bloom Horn Book"<br><br>Everything changed after the toaster hit Nick on the head. It fell from an attic full of junk in the ramshackle Victorian house in Colorado Springs that 14-year-old Nick, his father, and younger brother have moved into from Tampa. Nick disposes of most of the things in the attic at a garage sale. What begins as a story about an adolescent boy coming to terms with his mother's death-and his guilt about the house fire that took her-quickly takes a turn for the supernatural and sinister as Nick discovers that the items he sold are the magical inventions of Nikola Tesla. And he must recover them before they fall into the hands of a murderous secret society, the Accelerati. The first entry in a planned trilogy, this collaboration between Shusterman and Elfman tempers the scarier elements of Nick's quest with deft, humorous writing and plenty of the ordinary adventures of a new kid in school finding his niche. Hand this one to fans of Rick Riordan's Kane Chronicles or Kenneth Oppel's Airborne (2004). - Magan Szwarek Booklist"<br><br>This entertaining and often surprising first book in Shusterman and Elfman's Accelerati trilogy is well-timed to take advantage of the resurgent interest in Nicola Tesla (and an omnipresent interest in secret societies and conspiracies). Fourteen-year-old Nick's family has just moved from Florida to Colorado after a fire that claimed the life of his mother. He discovers that the attic of his new house is filled with odd contraptions, and he hosts a yard sale in which dozens of people buy nearly everything, just before a mysterious government group shows up and attempts to claim it. Nick and his new friends Mitch, Vince, and Caitlin figure out that their devices can do much more than expected, like record people's thoughts and display the future, as well as that the items were built by Tesla and part of a war between two secret societies. The authors have fun with a large cast of characters (and the historical record), making for an exciting and imaginative thriller with some skillful twists. Ages 8 12. PW"<br><br>Gr 4-8 People flocked to Nick Slate's garage sale to buy up the junk found in the old Victorian house in Colorado Springs that his father inherited. In fact, an oversized stage light shone out into the rain, compelling neighbors to pay top dollar for gadgets, toys, and appliances. The 14-year-old is dumbfounded to learn that some of the items his classmates bought have peculiar features, such as Caitlin's reel-to-reel tape machine that records what she says, but plays back what she thinks even embarrassing truths. Mitch's See n Say gadget predicts the future, and Vince's wet-cell electrodes can reanimate dead insects. Even Nick's brother, Danny, finds an old baseball glove that can change the arc of trajectory to catch any ball or flying sphere, making quite a spectacle at his baseball game. When sinister-looking men in pastel suits show up looking for the items, Nick and his new friends believe they are part of a group of scientists called the Accelerati and the teens must figure out the connection to Nikola Tesla, a contemporary of Thomas Edison's who once lived in Nick's house. Scientific details explain the basis for the far-fetched happenings, allowing readers to suspend their disbelief. The peril faced by this likable group of teens trying to keep Tesla's gadgets safe will keep mystery fans waiting anxiously for the next installment. Vicki Reutter, State University of New York at Cortland SLJ"<br><br>In Book 1 of the Accelerati Trilogy, Nick Slate cleans out his attic, holds a garage sale and changes "the very course of human existence." The junk in the attic of Nick's new house seems to be a "boneyard of uselessness," but the old toasters, electric mixers, cameras and tape recorders turn out to be lost inventions of a mad scientist, and finding them makes Nick and his friends "part of some invisible clockwork churning its gears toward some dark, mysterious end." The box camera foretells the future, the See 'n Say toy channels the universe, little brother Danny's baseball glove draws stars from the sky, and depleted wet-cell battery brings the dead to life. A posse of sinister scientists is after these objects for their own questionable ends, and if Nick's garage sale has unleashed forces that might end the world, they also might reveal a way to head off the extinction of the human race. Lively, intelligent prose elevates this story of teenagers versus mad scientists, the third-person point of view offering a stage to various players in their play of galactic consequence. A wild tale in the spirit of Back to the Future, with a hint of Malamud's The Natural tossed in.

Phillips.<p></p><p>A companion volume to <i>The Lady's Confession</i> and <i>The Curate's Awakening</i> (though each story is complete in itself), this is the story of Richard, the "apprentice" of the title. While an infant, he had been rescued from someone who viewed him as a threat, and his childhood and eventual apprenticeship as a bookbinder were marked by steady growth, both as a man of integrity and a skilled artisan. As a young man, Richard unknowingly returns to the estate of his birth, hired as a bookbinder to repair old volumes in the library.</p><p>George MacDonald, Scotland's master storyteller, brilliantly unfolds Richard's discovery of his heritage, both earthly and spiritual, through the help of Thomas Wingfold, the Curate to whom MacDonald readers have already been introduced.</p><p>Unforgettable fiction with rare spiritual impact from Bethany House!</p></p><p>GEORGE MACDONALD (1824-1905), forerunner of the Inklings--Scottish minister, poet, novelist, and imaginative seer--was one of the most beloved Victorian authors throughout Great Britain and the U.S. in the 19th century. He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center Seven. After his death, most of MacDonald&#39;s books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald&#39;s reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century. MacDonald&#39;s most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald&#39;s prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: &#34;I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.&#34; Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage. MacDonald&#39;s writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald&#39;s novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis&#39;s later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia. In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis&#39; s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis&#39;s words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis&#39; s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman&#39;s influence in his own life, MacDonald&#39;s name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable. A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald&#39;s sermon extracts. MacDonald&#39;s name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips&#39;s work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald&#39;s stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald&#39;s books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime. Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.</p><h2>The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time) - The Graphic Novel - Volume One</h2><p>&#34;All of the dialogue is straight out of the book. Dixon is able to make the story flow on the page, without making it feel too dry or wordy. All the characters look like how I might imagine them. Fans of the books will be reminded of the things they enjoyed about the series in the first place.&#34; -Geeks of Doom &#34;I loved it. I really loved it. This is not just a beautiful visual aid to the story, but a means of being able to enjoy the story in a new way. I eagerly look forward to the next volume.&#34; -Richard Fife on Dragonmount &#34;Dixon and Conley are operating at an extremely high level, making superb storytelling choices not only within the confines of a single issue but when considering the series as a whole. Dixon&#39;s pacing is impeccable and his narration bang on. Conley&#39;s astounding, atmospheric artwork only reinforces Dixon&#39;s narrative framework. This series continues to impress with its strong storytelling and respectful treatment of Jordan&#39;s source material. Arguably one of the best comic book adaptations on the shelves today, The Eye of the World is quickly proving itself to be a series of craftsmanship and heart.&#34;-Broken Frontier on The Eye of the World: the Graphic Novel, Volume One &#34;The series should provide fans of the novels with an enjoyable take on an old favorite and possibly introduce new readers to this fantasy classic.&#34;-The Jersey Journal on The Eye of the World comic book &#34;The story feels like it was intended for the comic-book medium. That is probably in no small way due to Chuck Dixon&#39;s hand in this. I hope there are more such top-flight comic-book adaptations of popular fantasy series in the offing.&#34;-Comic Critique on New Spring: the Graphic Novel</p><p></p><h2>A Manual for Living (Little Book of Wisdom (Harper San Francisco))</h2><p>The essence of perennial Stoic wisdom in aphorisms of stunning insight and simplicity.

Dishes like Chicken-Fried Pork Steak with Ramen Crust and Buttermilk Pepper Gravy; Collards and Kimchi; Braised Beef Kalbi with Soft Grits and Scallions; and Miso-Smothered Chicken all share a place on his table.

I originally put it together as a class assignment at the University of Oklahoma&#x2019;s Professional Writing program, more than two years before <i>Storm Front</i> found a home at Roc.</p><p>This one won&#x2019;t win any awards, because it is, quite frankly, a novice effort. It was perhaps the third or fourth short story I&#x2019;d ever written, if you include projects in grade school. I had barely learned to keep my feet under me as a writer, and to some degree that shows in this piece. Certainly, the editors to whom I submitted this story seemed to think it wasn&#x2019;t up to par for professional publication, and I think that was a perfectly fair assessment.</p><p>Read this story for what it is&#x2014;an anxious beginner&#x2019;s first effort, meant to be simple, straightforward fun.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><br>------------------------------<br><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>I</b> struggled to hold on to the yowling child while fumbling a quarter into the pay phone and jamming down the buttons to dial Nick&#x2019;s mobile.</p><p>&#x201c;Ragged Angel Investigations,&#x201d; Nick answered. His voice was tense, I thought, anxious.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Harry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You can relax, man. I found her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did?&#x201d; Nick asked. He let out a long exhalation. &#x201c;Oh, Jesus, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>The kid lifted up one of her oxford shoes and mule-kicked her leg back at my shin. She connected, hard enough to make me jump. She looked like a parent&#x2019;s dream at eight or nine years old, with her dimples and dark pigtails&#x2014;even in her street-stained schoolgirl&#x2019;s uniform. And she had strong legs.</p><p>I got a better hold on the girl and lifted her up off the ground again while she twisted and wriggled. &#x201c;Ow. Hold still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me go, beanpole,&#x201d; she responded, turning to glower back at me before starting to kick again.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to me, Harry,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to let the kid go right this minute and walk away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nick, the Astors are going to give us twenty-five grand to return her before nine p.m.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got some bad news, Harry. They aren&#x2019;t going to pay us the money.&#x201d;</p><p>I winced. &#x201c;Ouch. Maybe I should just drop her off at the nearest precinct house, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The news gets worse. The parents reported the girl kidnapped. The police band is sending two descriptions around town to Chicago PD, and they match guess who.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mickey and Donald?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heh,&#x201d; Nick said. I heard him flick his Bic and take a drag. &#x201c;We should be so lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s more embarrassing for Mr. and Mrs. High-and-Mighty to have their kid run away than it is to have her kidnapped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell. Kidnapped girl gives them something to talk about at their parties for months. Makes them look richer and more famous than their friends, too. Of course, we&#x2019;ll be in jail, but what the hell?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They came to us,&#x201d; I protested.</p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be the way they tell it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;If you get caught with her, it could be trouble for both of us. The Astors got connections. Ditch the girl and get back home. You were there all night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Nick,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let the boys in blue bring her in. That&#x2019;ll clear you and me both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m up on North Avenue, and it&#x2019;s after dark. I&#x2019;m not leaving a nine-year-old girl out here by herself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten,&#x201d; shouted the girl, furious. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ten, you insensitive jerk!&#x201d; She started kicking again, and I kept myself more or less out of the way of her feet.</p><p>&#x201c;She sounds so cute. Just let her run, Harry, and let the criminal types beware.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aw, hell, Harry. You&#x2019;re getting moral on me again.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled, but it felt tight on my mouth, and my stomach churned with anger. &#x201c;Look, we&#x2019;ll think of something. Just get down here and pick us up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to your car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Broke down this afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Again? What about the El?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m broke. Nick, I need a ride. I can&#x2019;t walk back to the office with her, and I don&#x2019;t want to stand here in a public booth fighting her, either. So get down here and get us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to spend time in jail because you can&#x2019;t salve your conscience, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about your conscience?&#x201d; I shot back. Nick was all bluster. When it came down to the wire, he couldn&#x2019;t have left the girl alone in that part of town, either.</p><p>Nick growled out something that sounded vaguely obscene, then said, &#x201c;Fine, whatever. But I can&#x2019;t get across the river very easy, so I&#x2019;ll be on the far side of the bridge. All you have to do is cross the bridge with her and stay out of sight. Police patrols in the area will be looking for you. Half an hour. If you&#x2019;re not there, I&#x2019;m not waiting. Bad neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have faith, man. I&#x2019;ll be there.&#x201d;</p><p>We hung up without saying good-bye.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, kid,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Stop kicking me and let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To hell with you, mister,&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Let me go before I break your leg.&#x201d;</p><p>I winced at the shrill note her voice hit and stepped away from the phone, half dragging and half carrying her with me while I looked around nervously. The last thing I needed was a bunch of good citizens running to the kid&#x2019;s aid.</p><p>The streets were empty, the gathering dark rushing in quickly to fill the spaces left by the broken streetlights. There were lights in the windows, but no one came out in response to the girl&#x2019;s shouting. It was the sort of neighborhood where people looked the other way and let live.</p><p>Ah, Chicago. You just gotta love big, sprawling American cities. Ain&#x2019;t modern living grand? I could have been a real sicko, rather than just looking like one, and no one would have done anything.</p><p>It made me feel a little nauseated. &#x201c;Look. I know you&#x2019;re angry right now, but believe me, I&#x2019;m doing what&#x2019;s best for you.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped kicking and glared up at me. &#x201c;How should you know what&#x2019;s best for me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m older than you. Wiser.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why are you wearing that coat?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at my big black duster, with its heavy mantle and long canvas folds flapping around my rather spare frame. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It belongs on the set of <i>El Dorado</i>,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;Who are you supposed to be, Ichabod Crane or the Marlboro Man?&#x201d;</p><p>I snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a wizard.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave me a look of skepticism you can really only get from children who have recently gone through the sobering trauma of discovering there is no Santa Claus. (Ironically, there is, but he can&#x2019;t operate on the sort of scale that used to make everyone believe in him.)</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I found you, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned at me. &#x201c;How did you find me? I thought that spot was perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>I continued walking toward the bridge. &#x201c;It would have been, for another ten minutes or so. Then that Dumpster would have been full of rats looking for something to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s expression turned faintly green. &#x201c;Rats?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. With luck, maybe I could win the kid over. &#x201c;Good thing your mother had your brush in her purse. I was able to get a couple of hairs from it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed. &#x201c;So, I used a little thaumaturgy, and it led me straight to you. I had to walk most of the way, but straight to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thauma-what?&#x201d;</p><p>Questions were better than kicks any day. I kept answering them. Heck, I like to answer questions about magic. Professional pride, maybe. &#x201c;Thaumaturgy. It&#x2019;s ritual magic. You draw symbolic links between actual persons, places, or events, and representative models. Then you invest a little energy to make something happen on the small scale, and something happens on the large scale as well&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The second I was distracted with answering her question, the kid bent her head and bit my hand.</p><p>I yelled something I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have around a kid and jerked my hand away. The kid dropped to the ground, agile as a monkey, and took off toward the bridge. I shook my hand, growled at myself, and took off after her. She was fast, her pigtails flying out behind her, her shoes and stained kneesocks flashing.</p><p>She got to the bridge first. It was an ancient, two-lane affair that arched over the Chicago River. She hurled herself out onto it.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I shouted after her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t know this town like I did.</p><p>&#x201c;Sucker,&#x201d; she called back, her voice merry. She kept on running.</p><p>That is, until a great rubbery, hairy arm slithered out from beneath a manhole cover at the apex of the bridge and wrapped its greasy fingers around one of her ankles. The kid screamed in sudden terror, pitching forward onto the asphalt and raking the skin from both knees. She turned and twisted, kicking at her attacker. Blood was a dark stain on her socks in the glow of the few functioning streetlights.</p><p>I cursed beneath my breath and raced toward her along the bridge, my lungs laboring. The hand tightened its grip and started dragging her toward the manhole. I could hear deep, growling laughter coming from the darkness in the hole that led down to the understructure of the bridge.</p><p>She screamed, &#x201c;What is it? What is it? Make it let go!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kid!&#x201d; I shouted. I ran toward the manhole, jumped, and came down as hard as I could on the hairy arm, right at the wrist, the heels of both hiking boots thumping down onto the grimy flesh.</p><p>A bellow erupted from the manhole, and the fingers loosened. The girl twisted her leg, and though it cost her one of her expensive oxfords and one kneesock, she dragged herself free of its grasp, sobbing. I gathered her up and backpedaled away, turning so that I wasn&#x2019;t leaving my back to the manhole.</p><p>The troll shouldn&#x2019;t have been able to squeeze his way out of a hole that small, but he d...</p></p><h2>A Companion to Familia Romana: Based on Hans �rberg&#x2019;s Latine Disco, with Vocabulary and Grammar (Lingua Latina) (Latin and English Edition)</h2><p>This volume is the completely reset Second Edition of Jeanne Marie Neumann's <i>A College Companion</i> (Focus, 2008).<br><br> It offers a running exposition, in English, of the Latin grammar covered in Hans H. �rberg's <i>Familia Romana</i>, and includes the complete text of the �rberg ancillaries <i>Grammatica Latina</i> and <i>Latin&#x2013;English Vocabulary</i>. It also serves as a substitute for �rberg's <i>Latine Disco</i>, on which it is based. As it includes no exercises, however, it is not a substitute for the �rberg ancillary <i>Exercitia Latina I</i>.<br><br> Though designed especially for those approaching <i>Familia Romana</i> at an accelerated pace, this volume will be useful to anyone seeking an explicit layout of <i>Familia Romana</i>'s inductively-presented grammar. In addition to many revisions of the text, the Second Edition also includes new units on cultural context, tied to the narrative content of the chapter.</p><p><b>Jeanne Marie Neumann</b> is Professor of Classics at Davidson College, where she has taught Latin, Greek, and Classical Civilization since 1994, and was awarded the College's most distinguished teaching award in 2005. She has conducted numerous seminars and workshops for Latin teachers at all levels of instruction, and has received national recognition for her educational outreach.&nbsp;In 2018 she received the CAMWS Award for Excellence in College Teaching.&nbsp;"A synthesis of language teaching research and teaching experience, Jeanne Marie Neumann's <i>A Companion to 'Familia Romana': Second Edition</i> is an extremely valuable ancillary for teachers and students who use the volume <i>Familia Romana: Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata</i> by Hans �rberg.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The <i>Companion</i> cleverly reworks and is presumably intended to replace (at least in English-speaking territories) the original three volumes written by �rberg: <i>Latina Disco</i>, <i>Grammatica Latina</i> and <i>Latin-English Vocabulary I</i>. Following the approach already adopted by �rberg, Neumann recommends undertaking the study of the Companion only after careful reading of the corresponding units in <i>Familia Romana</i> and the Latin Grammar sections therein. On this approach, the deepening of a student's metalinguistic understanding is postponed until (although not in reality subordinated to) the acquisition of morphology, syntax, and vocabulary, since the grammatical explanations function as an additional aid to understanding already simultaneously encountered (and thus partially assimilated) rules in the course of undertaking the Latin readings. Each chapter is accompanied by a major cultural and historical excursus (Studia Romana), absent in the first edition of the <i>Companion</i> and always connected with the content of individual chapters. The presence of a list of words with English translation at the end of each section, absent in the original Latin volume, proves successful and effective because it allows one to determine with certainty not only the primary meaning of a word but also the exact meaning with which it is used in various contexts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big innovation in this second edition is the inclusion of expository units on Roman civilization. These sections, always written in a lively and engaging style, significantly enrich the �rberg course, making it better serve the needs of those students of the Latin language who also wish to gain familiarity with Roman culture and civilization.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new edition of the <i>Companion</i> will certainly help rekindle the debate not only on the direct teaching of the Latin language but also on the need for renewal in the teaching of ancient languages. Indeed, thanks to its structure and rigor, Neumann's work does everything necessary to adapt to present-day needs a text which, although it was conceived over fifty years ago, is still a very solid and valuable tool for starting the reading of classics."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Giuseppe Marcellino, <i>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit�t M�nchen</i>, in <i>BMCR</i><br><br>"<i>Familia Romana</i> and&nbsp;<i>A Companion to Familia Romana</i> came as a complete revelation. I'd heard they were unique, but they are literally nothing less than a work of genius. They would completely revolutionize the classroom, and I would urge all teachers of first-year Latin at universities and all high school teachers to seriously consider adopting this radical approach to learning Latin. The companion volume provides all the traditional exposure you would want, but the main volume shows every prospect of genuinely internalizing Latin in the learner's brain as a living language, calling on a whole set of language-acquisition skills and instincts normally neglected in the teaching of a dead language. Mind-blowing."<br> &#x2014;Jack Mitchell, Department of Classics, Dalhousie University&nbsp;<br><br>"For anyone committed to learning or teaching active Latin, Hans H. �rberg's&nbsp;<i>Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata</i>&nbsp;is a singularly rich approach. But inductive language acquisition in a traditional school setting offers a set of challenges in response to which Jeanne M. Neumann's&nbsp;<i>Lingua Latina: A Companion to&nbsp;Familia Romana</i>&nbsp;has become the sine qua non. The&nbsp;<i>Companion</i>&nbsp;is designed as an aid for those learning Latin at the university levels, independent learners, and instructors at all levels. This Second Edition adds minor changes to the text of the first edition and new, multi-faceted culture sections in each chapter, called&nbsp;<i>Studia R&#x43e;&#x304;man&#x430;&#x304;</i>. As a bridge between the inductive method and deductive rules and paradigms, this new edition of the&nbsp;<i>Companion</i>&nbsp;has become a singular essential resource. Much more than a meticulously crafted and effective complement to the �rberg method and texts, the&nbsp;<i>Companion</i>&nbsp;offers the most essential element of natural Latin language acquisition: lucid explanations of the unambiguous beauty of Latin&#x2019;s grammar and style."<br> &#x2014;Cynthia White,&nbsp;University of Arizona, in&nbsp;<i>The Classical Outlook</i></p><h2>Yin Yoga: Principles and Practice 10th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The 10th Anniversary Edition of <i>Yin Yoga: Outline of a Quiet Practice</i> by Paul Grilley brings together in a fresh way the ancient wisdom of acupuncture and Taoism with Hindu yoga practices. With over 150,000 copies sold, Grilley's book has been enhanced with new materials describing the evolution of Yin Yoga within the Yoga world over the last decade plus new reference materials on anatomy and the practice of Yin Yoga.<br><br>Yoga as practiced in the US is almost exclusively Yang or muscular in nature. The Yin aspect of Yoga (using postures that stretch connective tissue) is virtually unknown but vital for a balanced approach to physical and mental health.<br><br>Paul Grilley outlines how to practice postures in a Yin way. Grilley includes an explanation of Modern Meridian Theory, which states that the meridians of acupuncture theory are currents flowing through the connective tissues of the body. Yin Yoga is specifically designed to address these tissues.<br><br>The two major differences between a Yin and a Yang Yoga practice are that Yin postures should be done with the muscles relaxed and should be held a long time. This is because connective tissue does not stretch like muscle and will not respond well to brief stresses. In addition, Yin Yoga better prepares people for meditation. For yoga practitioners looking for something beyond physical postures. Yin Yoga addresses the deeper spiritual dimensions of yoga, with helpful sections on chakras, breathing exercises, and meditation.</p><p><b>Paul Grilley</b> has been teaching Yoga since 1980 and his special interest is the teaching of Anatomy. He practices yoga postures in the style of Paulie Zink and patterns his philosophy on the writings and researches of Dr. Hiroshi Motoyama &#x2014;a yogi and scientist from Tokyo, Japan. This philosophy integrates the Taoist meridian and acupuncture theories of China with the yogic and tantric theories of India. Paul lives in Ashland, Oregon with his wife Suzee.<br><br> Anyone who thinks that yin yoga sounds wimpy should gaze hard at the photographs in this book, which illustrate some pretty challenging poses. Grilley&#x2019;s technique offers a unique blend of yoga meditation and Taoist principles.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> People are thirsty for a way to slow down. Paul Grilley&#x2019;s <i>Yin Yoga</i> can help people find a place of peace and quiet within themselves. Grilley brings understanding, experience and lighthearted humility to all his teaching. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d; Biff Mithoefer, author of <i>The Yin Yoga Kit</i><br></p><h2>Life Application Study Bible NKJV</h2><p>This best-selling study Bible is now available in the New King James Version.

In fact much of Baldaev's family moved through the Soviet prison system, while he became a guard. At his father's suggestion, Danzig used his access to document and study the tattoos that were pervasive among the truly criminal portion of the prison population, the <i>vory v zakonye</i>, or legitimate thieves, a semi-professional class who kept their own brutal laws. During his 30 years supervising inmates in St. Petersburg's notorious Kresty Prison, Baldaev recorded more than 3,000 of their tattoos and parsed their meanings, in the drawings and text that made the first volume of the <i>Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedia</i> a bestseller. This essential second volume, which collects all-new, previously unseen photographs and drawings, goes to the extremes of his incredible collection. Sergei Vasiliev's photographs authenticate the images, Baldaev's drawings make sense of them and through them both we glimpse an extraordinary world where the criminal's position, history and even sexual preference are displayed indelibly on his body.</p><p>This completely mind-blowing book told us what the tattoos meant, and how they could become central to the movie. -- <i>David Cronenberg. Director, Eastern Promises (2007) </i></p><h2>The Quest for Meekness and Quietness of Spirit</h2><p>While the world knows Matthew Henry best for his time-enduring Exposition of the Old and New Testaments, the cultivation of personal piety in himself and others was the great business of his practical life; and his treatises on the godly life, while little known today, are among the finest ever written. Rich in and alert to the things of the spirit, they reveal, as so impressively shown in this volume, a spiritual mind of preeminent degree in the full and deliberate worship of God. The author here pleads with us to avail ourselves of the &#34;ornament of a meek and quiet spirit&#34; and to apply this precious and comely grace in all our contacts in everyday living. No message could be more practical or fitting for this age, when the world, more than ever, is too much with us. This is a deep and tender, altogether winsome plea. Would you know the nature, excellence, and application of this meekness and quietness? Come then with the author to Him who said &#34; . . . learn of me, for I am meek and lowly&#34; And all the world will see and know that we have been with Jesus. Living and dying, let us be found among the &#34;quiet in the land&#34; We all wish to see quiet families, and quiet churches, and quiet neighborhoods, and quiet nations; and it will be so if there be quiet hearts; and not otherwise.</p><p>Matthew Henry (1662-1714) was an English nonconformist clergyman.</p><h2>Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Want</h2><p>Cindy Fox was a waitress.

Many churches have begun to share key leadership duties, but don't know how to take their leadership team to the point where it <em>thrives.</em> Others seriously need a new approach to leadership: pastors are tired, congregations are stuck, and meanwhile the work never lets up. But what does it actually mean to do leadership well as a team? How can it be done in a way that avoids frustration and burnout? How does team leadership best equip the staff and bless a congregation? What do the top church teams do to actually thrive together? Researchers and practitioners Ryan Hartwig and Warren Bird have discovered churches of various sizes and traditions throughout the United States who have learned to thrive under healthy team leadership. Using actual church examples, they present their discoveries here, culminating in five disciplines that, if implemented, can enable your team to thrive. The result? A coaching tool for senior leadership teams that enables struggling teams to thrive, and resources teams doing well to do their work even better.</p><p><strong>Ryan Hartwig</strong> (PhD, University of Colorado) is associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and associate professor of communication at Azusa Pacific University.<br><br><strong>Warren Bird</strong> (PhD, Fordham University) is research director for Leadership Network, and has authored or coauthored over twenty books for ministry leaders."At Saddleback we've shared leadership from the beginning.&nbsp;While it's not always been easy, it's absolutely been worth it.

The book provides readers with: enhanced knowledge of their own and their partners' beliefs, values, habits, desires, goals, likes, and dislikes; ideas for opening communication and deepening a relationship; skills for making healthy decisions about lifestyles and boundaries; an in-depth understanding of the role of self-esteem in relationships; increased ability to let go of the past and embrace the present; and the knowledge that it is important not only to choose the right partner, but also to be the right partner. What distinguishes Intellectual Foreplay from similar titles is that it includes guidelines on what to do with the answers it gives. This makes it useful in both creating and sustaining a relationship.<br></p><p>"What should you ask someone before you get seriously involved?" Eve Eschner Hogan wondered while she was starting a long-distance relationship with her future husband, Steve Hogan. <i>Intellectual Foreplay</i> is designed to spark stimulation and interest through intimate communication. "Like its physical counterpart, [it] can build excitement and desire--or quickly reveal a lack of compatibility, saving you months, or even years, of developing a relationship that isn't going to work," say the authors.<p> It's an interesting concept: questions to ask to determine compatibility or just get to know a lover or potential lover better. The book starts with "Who Are You?" questions covering a myriad of topics, such as self-esteem, values, hobbies, trust, romance, spirituality, health, and time management. Other sections include "Where Did You Come From?" (past, family, friends, education, and intelligence), "Where Are You Going?" (money, work, and future), "Can We Live Together?" (home, household responsibilities, food, bathroom, pets, vehicles, garden), and "Where Are We Going?" (vacations, holidays, children, wedding, and sex). Some questions will strike you as significant and others as unsubstantial--choose the ones that intrigue you. Tips for using the questions productively are peppered throughout the book. For example, figure out your top 20 "non-negotiable" questions and answer them yourself before asking them of a partner. It's an interesting spin on relationship deepening, and will certainly spark conversation. <i>--Joan Price</i></p></p><h2>Spiritual Discernment</h2><p>Certainly spiritual discernment is the pressing need of today.

And Batman must return once again to save the world from themselves.<br><br>Still, the world looks fine: a perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet.&nbsp; Only Batman knows better.&nbsp; He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears once and for all.<br><br>The Dark Knight returns once again with a vitality unseen since the first years of his war on crime.&nbsp; Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley&#x2014;formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl&#x2014;the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost.<br><br><i>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i> features appearances by such DC icons as Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, Martian Manhunter, the Atom, the Question and more.&nbsp; But are they still the World's Greatest Heroes or part of the conspiracy? <br><br>This incredible volume, designed by multiple award-winner Chipp Kidd, features a new introduction by Miller commenting on returning to the world he created fifteen years ago.&nbsp; The book includes the complete 3-part story, plus numerous sketches and other never-before-seen material.</p><p><i>The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i> is Frank Miller's follow-up to his hugely successful <i>Batman: the Dark Knight Returns</i>, one of the few comics that is widely recognized as not only reinventing the genre but also bringing it to a wider audience.Set three years after the events of <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>, <i>The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i> follows a similar structure: once again, Batman hauls himself out of his self-imposed retirement in order to set things right. However, where <i>DKR</i> was about him cleaning up his home city, Gotham, <i>DKSA</i> has him casting his net much wider: he's out to save the world. The thing is, most of the world doesn't realize that it needs to be saved--least of all Superman and Wonder Woman, who have become little more than superpowered enforcers of the status quo. So, the notoriously solitary Batman is forced to recruit some different superpowered allies. He also has his ever-present trusty sidekick, Robin, except that he is a she, and she is calling herself Catwoman. Together, these super-friends uncover a vast and far-reaching conspiracy that leads to the President of the United States (Lex Luthor) and beyond.<p><i>The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i> is largely an entertaining comic, but much of what made <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i> so good just doesn't work here. Miller's gritty, untidy artwork was perfect for <i>DKR</i>'s grim depiction of the dark and seedy Gotham City, but it jars a bit for <i>DKSA</i>, which is meant to depict an ultra-glossy, futuristic technocracy. Lynn Varley's garish coloring attempts to add a slicker sheen, but the artwork is ultimately let down by that which worked so well for <i>DKR</i>--this time around, it just feels sloppy and rushed. The same is true of the book's denouement, which happens so quickly that it leaves the reader reeling and looking for more of an explanation. Moreover, <i>DKSA</i> is packed full of characters who will mean little to those unfamiliar with the DC Comics universe (e.g., the Atom, the Elongated Man, the Question). Perhaps the book's biggest failing is that where <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i> gave comic book fans a base from which to evangelize to theuninitiated, <i>The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i> is just preaching to the converted. Comic book superhero fans will find much to enjoy here, but others would be better off sticking with the original. <i>--Robert Burrow</i></p>Frank Miller began his career in comics in the late 1970s and rose to fame while first drawing, and then writing, <i>Daredevil</i> for Marvel Comics. He was also the creative force behind <i>Batman: The Dark Knight</i> <i>Returns</i>, <i>Batman: Year One</i>, and <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i>.&nbsp; His many works have not only redefined classic characters, but also, on a few occasions, revitalized the comics industry. His creator-owned <i>Sin City</i> hit the page in 1991, and then the silver screen in 2005 &#x2014; with Miller on board as co-director. His multi-award-winning <i>300 </i>graphic novel was brought to full-blooded life in the 2007 motion picture of the same name, and in 2008 he directed the feature film of <i>Will Eisner&#x2019;s The Spirit</i>.</p><h2>Right Here Right Now: The Practice of Christian Mindfulness</h2><p><p>Christians have always practiced mindfulness. Yet, from the popular landscape of mindfulness movement, you&#x2019;d never know that. Where is the Christian voice in this fast-growing movement? Many Christians practice mindfulness outside of church and believe it does not belong to our faith tradition. This book reveals the Christian roots of mindfulness and the actual practices that, when reclaimed, deepen the life of faith and the power of our mission of love in the world.&nbsp; When we understand how radical it is to live in God&#x2019;s presence right here, right now, our lives are transformed toward mercy, justice and abundant life.<br> <br> Amy Oden shows how the practice of Christian mindfulness begins with the teachings of Jesus and continues throughout Christian history. It also includes step-by-step instructions for the practice of Christian mindfulness today. Pastors and leaders will find this book useful on the ground as they curate current culture and guide Christians in spiritual practices.</p> <p>" ... this is the best introduction to Christian mindfulness I have read." &#x2014;Shaun Lambert, Senior Minister of Stanmore Baptist Church, United Kingdom</p> <p> &#x201c;Amy Oden knows the history of Christian spirituality as well as anyone, and she helps us see what might seem surprising to many&#x2014;that mindfulness has deep roots in the<br> Christian tradition. The wisdom she shares in this clear, winsome book has already deepened my own life of prayer. I know this book will bear fruit in classrooms and<br> congregations as readers heed its call to stop and pay prayerful attention to what God is doing, right here, right now.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;L. Roger Owens, Associate Professor of Christian Spirituality and Ministry, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Pittsburgh, PA</p> <p> &#x201c;Oden deftly lifts up a clear template for what lies at the core of all spiritual practice: mindfulness&#x2014;a simple awareness within ordinary life of divine presence, here and now. Unlike many generic practices of mindfulness now popular in business, education, and the fitness industry, Oden underscores that Christian mindfulness is not an end in itself but an awareness that turns us toward God. Amy&#x2019;s words become a litany of invitation into the posture of open-hearted presence to the Presence, right here, right now.&#x201d; (<em>from the foreword</em>)<br> &#x2014;Marjorie J.

When a well-known bibliophile is found dead, leaving behind part of the original manuscript of Alexandre Dumas's <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, Corso is brought in to authenticate the fragment. He is soon drawn into a swirling plot involving devil worship, occult practices, and swashbuckling derring-do among a cast of characters bearing a suspicious resemblance to those of Dumas's masterpiece. Aided by a mysterious beauty named for a Conan Doyle heroine, Corso travels from Madrid to Toledo to Paris on the killer's trail in this twisty intellectual romp through the book world.</p></p><p>Fallen angels, satanic manuals, and a passion for the works of Raphael Sabatini and Alexandre Dumas among others--this is the stuff of Spanish author Arturo P�rez-Reverte's engrossing novel <i>The Club Dumas.</i> Set in a world of antiquarian booksellers where dealers would gladly betray their own mothers to get their hands on a rare volume, <i>The Club Dumas</i> is a thinking person's thriller: in addition to a riveting plot, the book is full of intriguing details that range from the working habits of Alexandre Dumas to how one might go about forging a 17th-century text. Woven through these meditations is enough murder, sex, and the occult to keep both the hero, Lucas Corso, and the reader hopping. <p> As in his previous novel, <i>The Flanders Panel,</i> set in the world of art restoration, Mr. P�rez-Reverte has written a literary thriller to tease both the intellect and adrenaline gland. Lucas Corso makes a complex, ultimately sympathetic hero, and there's plenty to delight in the intricate twists and turns the story takes before the mystery of <i>The Club Dumas</i> is finally solved.</p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 1997, 0-15-100182-0<br></p><h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion, Vol. 2</h2><p>The manga adaptation of the landmark animated series that changed the mecha genre.

A window into who we are, the theology of the body is a theology for the rooms where we make love. But it s also a theology for the rooms where we work, where we eat, where we laugh, and where we pray. <i>These Beautiful Bones</i> takes you on a walk through those rooms. With both humor and practical wisdom, it sheds light on what the theology of the body has to say about life beyond the bedroom, about the everyday moments of life, helping you discover how to let grace enter into those moments and make of them something extraordinary.</p><p><p>"As a writer, Emily Stimpson always brings to her readers a unique combination of deep wisdom, practical insight and personal experience. In <i>These Beautiful Bones</i>, she uses the sacramental lens of the liturgy to explore a wide range of activities in daily life. Whether it's your eating habits or clothing styles, the dignity of hard work or the pitfalls of pop culture, you will find in this book lots of graceful guidance in living out the physical side of being spiritual. " <b>Dr. Scott Hahn</b>, Internationally renowned author and biblical theologian<br></p> <p>"<i>These Beautiful Bones</i> is the book that lovers of the theology of the body have been long awaiting! It answers questions which have been asked for years now, such as What does the theology of the body mean for how we eat and take care of our bodies? or What implications does it have in our technological world? Applying concepts from John Paul II's deep work to the questions and concerns of everyday life, it helps the reader to see life with a sacramental worldview. Simple, funny and easy to read, I recommend Emily Stimpson's book to everyone! Those versed in the theology of the body will appreciate its practical relevance, while those who are not yet familiar with John Paul II's message will learn about it the easy way! " <b>Anastasia Northrop</b>, President of Theology of the Body International Alliance<br></p> <p>"Emily Stimpson is to be commended for taking the theology of the body beyond the bedroom and applying the sacramental worldview to all aspects of life. Whether it's mowing the lawn, doing the laundry, sitting on the porch with friends, or cleaning lice out of her house (one of many humorous stories she tells), Emily shows how the theology of the body is for every body in all the circumstances of life. Her writing is sharp, humorous, engaging, personal, and encouraging. Give this a read! " <b>Christopher West</b>, Author and speaker on the Theology of the Body<br></p><p> "In this book Emily Stimpson makes a real contribution to our reception of the theology of the body. She shows that this original catechesis of John Paul does not just concern sex but concerns everyday life; it concerns living sacramentally, living the truth of our embodiment, living so we remain connected through our bodies with the higher meaning of existence. In an age in which we have become dangerously estranged from our bodies, she offers wise and practical reflections on how to recover a more integrated, sacramental way of living. She helps us to cultivate a Christian lifestyle that reaches into the smallest corners of our lives how we eat, how we manage our cellphones, how we work with our hands. May many readers be blessed by the down-to-earth wisdom of Emily Stimpson. " <b>Dr. John Crosby</b>, Director and Professor of Philosophy, Franciscan University of Steubenville<br></p> --Endorsements<br><br><p>"In trademark style, Stimpson draws us into a winsome conversation about the profound impact a theology of the body can have in ordinary, everyday life. Deftly moving from the deepest theological truths to their most practical life examples, this is one of those ah-hah books that gives non-theologians access to the sublime reality of the sacramental worldview. Among the many noteworthy musings, the sections on spiritual fatherhood and spiritual motherhood are some of the best I have ever read. " <b>Damon C. Owens</b>, Executive Director, Theology of the Body Institute<br></p> <p>"Think you already know about the theology of the body? Think again. Emily Stimpson cracks open John Paul II's revolutionary teachings in a way that few others have done, revealing layers of depth and richness that many of us never knew were there. Whether you've been studying this subject for years or are only beginning to explore it, <i>These Beautiful Bones</i> is a must-read.

In addition to sharing her own experiences, she provides examples from the Bible of those who surrendered to God's plan, including Esther, Hannah, Joseph, and Jesus. 'Choosing to believe God when a situation remains unresolved... is a serious lesson in surrender.' Story addresses how one's choices affect others and why the act of surrendering often leads to the betterment or reconciliation of relationships. Following her husband's recovery and the healthy birth of her son (whose cleft palate required less surgery than they imagined), she explains how 'giving up' allowed God to use her disappointments to display his glory. Story also includes uplifting lyrics from her songs and concludes chapters with prayers based on the idea of surrender. Her tale of maintaining faith through hardship and her message that 'surrender is the secret to a life of joy' will appeal both to fans of her music and Christian readers alike.

It was followed seven months later by <i>Malone Dies</i> and two years later by <i>The Unnamable</i>. All three have been rendered into English by the author.</p><p>Samuel Beckett's brilliance as a dramatist--as the creator of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, <i>Krapp's Last Tape</i>, and that despairing pas de deux <i>Endgame</i>--has tended to overshadow his gifts as a novelist. Yet he's unmistakably one of the great fiction writers of our century. As a young man he took dictation (literally) from James Joyce, and absorbed everything that myopic maestro had to offer when it came to Anglo-Irish prosody. Still, Beckett's instincts would ultimately steer him away from Joyce's delirious play with high and low diction, toward a more concentrated, even compulsive style. His earlier novels, like <i>Murphy</i> or <i>Watt</i>, give us a taste of what was to come. But Beckett truly hit his stride with a trilogy of early-1950s masterpieces: <i>Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable</i>. Here he dispenses with all the customary props of contemporary fiction--including exposition, plot, and increasingly, paragraphs--and turns his attention to consciousness itself. Nobody has ever evoked the pain of existence, or the steady slide toward nonexistence, with such poetic, garrulous accuracy. And once you've attuned yourself to the epistemological vaudeville of Beckett's prose, he turns out to be the funniest writer on the planet--ever.<p> None of the three entries in the trilogy is exactly amenable to summary. It's fair to say, though, that <i>Molloy</i> is the easiest to read, with at least a bare-bones narrative and an abundance of comical set pieces. In one famous episode, the narrator spends page after page figuring out how to vary the sucking stones he carries in his pockets: </p><blockquote> And while I gazed thus at my stones, revolving interminable martingales all equally defective, and crushing handfuls of sand, so that the sand ran through my fingers and fell back on the strand, yes, while thus I lulled my mind and part of my body, one day suddenly it dawned on the former, dimly, that I might perhaps achieve my purpose without increasing the number of my pockets, or reducing the number of my stones, but simply by sacrificing the principle of trim. The meaning of this illumination, which suddenly began to sing within me, like a verse of Isaiah, or of Jeremiah, I did not penetrate at once, and notably the word trim, which I had never met with, in this sense, long remained obscure. </blockquote> This nutty ratiocination goes on for much, much longer, until the narrator loses patience and throws the stones away. And that's a fair encapsulation of Beckett's philosophy: he argues for the essential pointlessness of life--the solitary, wretched splendor of human existence--but does so in a comic rather than a tragic register, which ends up softening or even overpowering the bleakness of his initial premise. So <i>Malone Dies</i> opens with a typically morbid mood-lifter ("I shall soon be quite dead at last in spite of it all") and then makes endless comedic hay out of Malone's failure to keel over. And by the time we hit <i>The Unnamable</i>, we're forced to wonder whether the narrator actually exists: "I, say I. Unbelieving. Questions, hypotheses, call them that. Keep going, going on, call that going, call that on." Happily, Beckett worried these same questions and hypotheses to the end of his career, with increasingly minimalistic gusto. But he never topped the intensity or linguistic brilliance of this mind-bending three-part invention. <i>--James Marcus</i>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906 and died in 1989. A playwright and novelist, he studied and taught in Paris and eventually settled there permanently. He wrote primarily in French, frequently translating his works into English himself. His novels include <b>Watt</b>; the trilogy <b>Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable</b>; <b>How It Is</b>; and<b><i> </i>The Lost Ones</b>. In his theater of the absurd, Beckett combined poignant humor with an overwhelming sense of anguish and loss. Best known among his dramas are <b>Waiting for Godot</b> and <b>Endgame</b>, which have been performed throughout the world. Beckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><h2>Desert Gardening: Fruits &amp; Vegetables</h2><p><b>An illustrated guide to growing plentiful fruits and vegetables in the driest of American climates</b><br>Wherever you live in the desert--up to 3,500-feet elevation--this guide is for you.

In this book Timothy Ward explains and defends what we are really saying when we trust and proclaim, as we must, that the Bible is God's word. In particular he describes the nature of the relationship between the living God and Scripture. He examines why, in order to worship God faithfully, we need to pay close attention to the Bible; why, in order to be faithful disciples of Jesus, the Word-made-flesh, we need to base our lives on the words of the Bible; and why, in order to keep in step with the Holy Spirit, we need to trust and obey what the Bible says. Ward offers an understanding of the nature of Scripture under three main headings. A <em>biblical</em> outline shows that the words of the Bible form a significant part of God's action in the world. A <em>theological</em> outline focuses on the relationship of Scripture with each of the persons of the Trinity. And a <em>doctrinal</em> outline examines the 'attributes' of Scripture. A final chapter explores some significant areas in which the doctrine of Scripture should be applied. Ward offers us an excellent, lucid exposition of the nature and function of Scripture, expressed in a form appropriate for the tweny-first century, grounded in the relevant scholarship, and standing firmily in line with the best of the theological traditions.</p><p>&#34;I have been on the lookout for a compelling and contemporary treatment of the nature and authority of Scripture for years. I ask of every promising new title, &#39;Are you the one who is to come, or shall I look for another?&#39; Ward&#39;s book may be the one. Words of Life rightly roots its thinking about Scripture in the doctrine of God, and that means trinitarian theology. His central insight: God&#39;s word is something that God does. The Bible is not simply an object to be studied but the principal means by which the Lord engages his people and administers his covenant. Ward is a British pastor-theologian in the best sense of the term. The deft treatment of inerrancy by one from the other side of the pond is an added bonus.

His films in the "Evil Dead" series are cult favorites and his TV roles spark the same enthusiasm. He lives in Oregon.</p>Though it offers few revelations about the details of Campbell's personal life, this entertaining and witty Hollywood memoir combines his life story with how-to guidance on making independent films and becoming a pop culture cult hero. Campbell began working in show business as a teenager, and in high school became friends with future director Sam Raimi, with whom he eventually co-produced the 1982 cult horror hit Evil Dead, in which Campbell starred. Despite his wry, modest sense of humor Campbell recognizes the peculiar place that Evil Dead holds in contemporary culture he sincerely conveys the enormous commitment and work that went into making and marketing the movie. By the time he describes the film's premiere, Campbell's sense of triumph is palpable: we share his excitement when the film makes back its money and by 2000 becomes number three on the all-time video charts after Lady and the Tramp and Titanic. When Campbell isn't starring in new films like Evil Dead II and Moontrap, he is desperately often hilariously looking for investors for his new projects. His subtitle aside, Campbell's career has gone mainstream: he has appeared in Homicide and Ellen, is a regular on Hercules and Xena, and has started directing as well. (June)Forecast: While a boon to film cultists and to Campbell's many fans, this book also has enough insights and smarts to appeal to readers with a serious interest in popular culture. A planned author tour and national print advertising will help it capitalize on Campbell's cult following.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives -- How Your Friends&#39; Friends&#39; Friends Affect Everything You Feel, Think, and Do</h2><p><b>Celebrated scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler explain the amazing power of social networks and our profound influence on one another's lives.</b><br>Your colleague's husband's sister can make you fat, even if you don't know her.

Christakis and Fowler's research has appeared on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, Today, </i>and <i>The Colbert Report</i>, and on the front pages of the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post,</i> and <i>USA Today</i>.The authors examine the importance of human connections and the influence of people&#39;s networks on how things happen in their lives. This interesting compilation of research covers topics such as how networks can help people solve problems and how many people need to be stopped and looking up on a sidewalk before an uninvolved passerby will do likewise. Nicholas Christakis brings a slightly academic tone to his narration, giving a bit of gravitas to what some may consider to be simple common sense: Happiness spreads through networks; happy people attract other happy people. While Christakis&#39;s delivery could benefit from more variation in tone, his steady pace makes this lengthy volume engaging.

Lauren&#x2019;s husband took his own life. Her younger daughter is looking only for what&#x2019;s left of her childhood. But Lauren never surrendered. She knows who took her child, and there&#x2019;s not a shred of evidence against him. <br><br>Looking for a fresh start, Lauren and her younger daughter Leah move to idyllic Oak Knoll. So has Lauren&#x2019;s suspect. And it feels that history is about to repeat itself.<br><br>Leah is turning sixteen, and Oak Knoll has a cunning predator on the hunt. But as sheriff&#x2019;s detective Tony Mendez and his team sift through the circumstances of an increasingly disturbing case, a stunning question changes everything they thought they knew...</p><p><b>TAMI HOAG</b>&nbsp;is the #1 international bestselling author of more than thirty books. There are more than forty million copies of her books in print in more than thirty languages. Renowned for combining thrilling plots with character-driven suspense, Hoag first hit the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller list with&nbsp;<i>Night Sins</i>, and each of her books since has been a bestseller. She&nbsp;lives in California.Before her daughter, Leslie, then 16, was abducted four years ago, Lauren Lawton had been a lovely woman. But with no assailant or body ever recovered, she has devoted all her energy to trying to keep Leslie&#x2019;s case in the headlines while simultaneously not neglecting her younger daughter, Leah, now nearly 16 herself. In an apparent attempt to make a clean start, Lauren and Leah leave Santa Barbara and head to the fictional Oak Knoll, a high-end pastoral retreat in the foothills. How is it, though, that Ronald Ballencoa, the monster whom Lauren is convinced took and probably murdered her daughter, also now resides in Oak Knoll? Lauren&#x2019;s obsession with Ballencoa is well known to and mostly disregarded by law enforcement in many local jurisdictions, but new-on-the-scene Deputy Mendez doesn&#x2019;t dismiss Lauren&#x2019;s pleas and hopes to be the one to finally bring some closure to the fractured family. Mendez, a prot�g� of legendary profiler Vince Leone (star of many Hoag thrillers), teams up with the feisty Danni Tanner, the original detective on the case (sparks fly between these two). Hoag takes obvious pleasure in keeping her setting circa 1990, before DNA technology had advanced to where it is today and before mobile communications rendered many otherwise tense situations easy-breezy. The setting and her consummate skill as a plotter add to plenty of old-school thrills that pack a punch and will leave fans breathless. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Hoag is on a remarkable streak: since 1995, she has written 30 books, and all 30 have appeared on the New York Times best-seller list. Her publisher will be doing everything in their marketing power to ensure that the streak hits 31. --Mary Frances Wilkens</p><h2>How to Build a Natural Swimming Pool</h2><p>Natural swimming pools are the biggest news for gardeners since green roofs.

As it is expensive, prime rib should be handled with extra care. It is imperative that you have an instant-read thermometer for determining the internal temperature; if allowed to cook too long, the meat will no longer be a rosy pink inside, the optimal color for any high-quality roast. Remove the roast when still rare, as it will continue to cook as it rests, rising as much as 10 degrees in 20 minutes. <br><br>Rubbing meat (as well as chicken and fish) with herbs, spices, and a bit of oil will add tremendous flavor. Here, the beef is coated with a mixture of bay leaves, sage, and orange zest, all familiar holiday flavors. Allowing the meat to &#x201c;marinate&#x201d; in the rub overnight deepens the flavor even more. A similar result is achieved by simply salting the meat a day or two before roasting, whereby the salt will have penetrated the meat much like a brining solution. <br> <br>Larger roasts such as prime rib, crown roast, and a whole turkey are started at a high temperature (450�F) to sear the meat, then the temperature is lowered after 30 minutes to prevent the outside from burning before the meat is cooked through. The exterior won&#x2019;t develop a crust right away, but the initial high heat gives the outside a head start so that it will be perfectly browned in the end.<br> <br> <b>For Rub</b><br> � 15dried bay leaves, crumbled <br> � 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh sage leaves, plus several whole leaves for garnish <br> � 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil <br> � Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper <br> � 1/3 cup finely grated orange zest (from 2 to 3 oranges)<br><b>For Roast</b><br> � 1 three-rib prime rib of beef (about 7 pounds), trimmed and frenched<br><b>Prepare meat:</b> Stir together crumbled bay leaves, sage, the oil, 1� teaspoons salt, and the orange zest in a small bowl. Season with pepper. Rub herb mixture all over the beef, coating evenly. Refrigerate overnight, covered. About 2 hours before you plan to cook the beef, remove it from the refrigerator. Place beef, fat side up, in a roasting pan and allow it to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 450�F. <br> <br> <b>Roast:</b> Cook beef for 30 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350�F and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into meat (away from bone) registers 115�F to 120�F (for rare), about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes longer. Let rest 20 minutes. <br> <br> <b>Carve and serve</b> Slice meat away from ribs, cutting along the bones. Then, slice meat crosswise to desired thickness. Serve, garnished with whole sage leaves.This comprehensive introduction to cooking overflows with helpful instruction in all matters culinary. As with any professional, Stewart understands that kitchen success is founded on the best battery of utensils. Making no assumptions, the book displays an array of cooking tools (but no electrical appliances) to outfit a basic kitchen.&nbsp;An inventory of ingredient staples includes just herbs, spices, onion family members, and citrus fruits. Ever a firm believer in the French fundamentals, Stewart commences with recipes for stocks that form bases for flavorful soups and sauces. But to attract contemporary cooks, she immediately turns chicken stock into a decidedly un-French tortilla soup. She also explains the making of dashi, a basic soup from Japanese cuisine. She goes so far as to analyze the complicated task of clarifying a consomm�, rarely addressed in contemporary home cooking. The sequence of recipes follows a thoughtful lesson plan so that basic techniques build on one another. Photographs show what to expect at different steps along the way. Ambitious students may pursue more advanced techniques appearing in sections labeled &#x201c;extra credit.&#x201d;&nbsp;Meat, poultry, and fish cookery forms the book&#x2019;s largest section. An entire chapter addresses pasta exclusively, befitting its key role in today&#x2019;s cooking. The Martha Stewart label will attract a host of readers. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>Salvation on Sand Mountain: Snake Handling and Redemption in Southern Appalachia</h2><p><b>A haunting exploration of faith, from a preacher convicted of attempted murder to a first-hand account of holiness serpent handling--"One of the best books on American religion from the last 25 years" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b><br><br> For <i>New York Times</i> reporter Dennis Covington, what began as a journalistic assignment-covering the trial of an Alabama pastor convicted of attempting to murder his wife with poisonous snakes-would evolve into a headlong plunge into a bizarre, mysterious, and ultimately irresistible world of unshakable faith: the world of holiness snake handling.Set in the heart of Appalachia, <i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> is Covington's unsurpassed and chillingly captivating exploration of the nature, power, and extremity of faith-an exploration that gradually turns inward, until Covington finds himself taking up the snakes.</p><p><i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> is a story of snake handling and strychnine drinking, of faith healing and speaking in tongues. It is also the story of one man's search for his roots--and, in the end, of his spiritual renewal. Writer Dennis Covington came to this ecstatic form of Christianity as a reporter covering a sensational murder case; Glen Summerford, pastor of the Church of Jesus with Signs Following, had been accused of attempting to kill his wife with rattlesnakes. There, in a courtroom filled with journalists and gawking spectators, Covington felt the pull of a spirituality that was to dominate his life for the next several years. Attending Summerford's church out of curiosity, he soon forged close friendships with some of the worshippers, began attending snake-handling services throughout the South, and eventually took up snakes himself. <p> With subject matter this lurid, <i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> could have been a Southern-fried curiosity and little more. Covington goes far deeper. Tracing the snake handlers' roots in regional history, in the deep spiritual alienation of mountain people from the secular modern world they have so recently joined, Covington is more than just sympathetic to the snake handlers; in a profound way, he considers himself one of them. His reasoning is sometimes flawed--when he attempts to find snake handlers in his own family's past, for instance, the result is belabored and unconvincing--but there's no doubt that Covington's heart is in the right place. He's also not without his own brand of sly gallows humor, as in this conversation with the elderly Gracie McAllister: "She'd swore she'd never handle rattlesnakes in July again. She'd been bit the previous two Julys. 'I decided I'd just handle fire and drink strychnine that night,' she said. <i>Good idea</i>, I thought. It always pays to be on the safe side." </p><p> Covington eventually breaks with the snake handlers, but comes away from the experience a changed man. "Knowing where you come from is one thing, but it's suicide to stay there," he writes. An American Book Award winner and finalist for the National Book Award, <i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> is a nuanced, compassionate portrait of an unforgettable spiritual journey. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><b>Dennis Covington</b> is the award-winning author of several books of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>Lizard </i>and <i>Lasso the Moon</i>.

But after turning to Christ, he provided for over 10,000 orphans--without ever asking anyone but God to supply his needs! He testified that he knew of at least 50,000 specific answers to his prayers. Here are his reports of a few of the most spectacular ones.From his amazing personal experiences, you will find the secret to receiving miraculous answers to your prayers.<b>George M�ller</b> (1805&#x2013;1898) was born in Kroppenstaedt, Prussia, on September 27, 1805. He was the son of a tax collector, and, before he became a Christian, he had the reputation of a liar and a thief. After accepting Christ as his personal Savior, he was used in remarkable ways to provide for over 10,000 orphans during his lifetime. He never went into debt or asked anyone to supply his needs. He trusted in God to provide for him and for the orphans, and God never failed to do so.<br> In 1834, he established the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad. Its objectives were to assist day schools and adult schools, where instruction was given based on scriptural principles; enable poor children to attend these day schools; circulate the Holy Scriptures; and aid in supplying the needs of missionaries and missionary schools. The fifth objective, which was added later, was to provide for the needs of orphaned children.<br> By the 1870s, God enabled George M�ller to build five large orphanages on Ashley Down in Bristol, England, and to send �10,000 annually to nearly two hundred missionaries.<br> In 1875, he began preaching tours that took him over 200,000 miles to 42 countries to preach to 3 million people. God transformed a little boy who stole from his earthly father into a man who could be trusted with the resources of his heavenly Father.<br> The ministry of George M�ller continues today through the establishment of the George M�ller Foundation. Three charities operate under the direction of the Foundation: The M�ller Homes for Children, the M�ller Homes for the Elderly, and the Scriptural Knowledge Institution.

But the greatness of God's grace and his salvation are far more than what most of us have come to expect!<br><br>Here Randy Clark shares what that "more" is--more love for God and others, more power, more joy, more faith, more results in prayer--and how believers can experience God's empowering presence in their lives to do more than they ever imagined. "More" is not only biblical, explains Clark, but essential for greater fruitfulness in ministry and for serving in the kingdom of God with joy and effectiveness.</p><p>This book contains my most important life's message.&nbsp; When I was 18, a freshman in a Baptist college, I heard the Lord speak to me on the first day of class, "The issue of your lifetime will be the Holy Spirit."&nbsp; This was an unusual word to receive for a young Baptist minister.&nbsp; Many years later, the first two times I first met John Wimber, both times he heard the audible word of the Lord say regarding me, "He will one&nbsp; day go around the world laying hands upon pastors and leaders releasing gifts and impartations to them."&nbsp; Ten years later this season of my life would begin. The word I heard the first day of college definitely has&nbsp; become true of my life.&nbsp; I wanted the&nbsp; message of the book to be biblical, historically illluminating, and inspiring due to the present day stories of impartation recorded in it.&nbsp; The biblical portion is to lay out the biblical foundation for the teaching regarding impartation.&nbsp; The historical portion reveals impartation is not a new teaching, but has been part of the history of the church.&nbsp; The testimonies are to prove that not only is the message biblical it is still for today.&nbsp; The miraculous aspects of the testimonies reveal the power of the Kingdom of God today that is to accompany the preaching of the gospel. The book is to be a challenge to the cessationist and/or liberal traditions.&nbsp; But, more importantly it has been used to cause a great hunger in many.&nbsp; Some pastors upon praying the prayer near the end of the book&nbsp; have received their own impartation of Holy Spirit's power and gifts.&nbsp; A few of these are now powerfully being used of God in their denomination or networks throughout the United States and around the world.<b>What if </b><b><i>more</i></b><b> is biblical? Even essential?<br></b><br>God is not a God of carefully measured handouts. He longs to give you more--as much as you're willing to receive. <br><br><b>More love. More power. More faith. More joy. More results in prayer.<br></b><br>With his trademark insight and encouragement, Randy Clark explains that more is not only biblical but essential for greater fruitfulness in ministry and service. And he shares how you can access the more God wants to give you.<br><br><b>It all starts with grace.<br></b><br>Grace is more than receiving eternal life. It is how we experience God's presence and power in our lives, and how He empowers us to do more than we ever imagined.<br><br><b>He wants to give you </b><b><i>more</i></b><b>. <br></b><br>He wants you to be a vessel of His glory.

According to Colin Tipping, this is because our idea of forgiveness usually requires a victim and a perpetrator&#x2015;which is impossible when we play both roles at the same time. Tipping's Radical Forgiveness process allows us to navigate this dilemma for deep and lasting healing. To help us gain freedom from excessive inner criticism and self-sabotaging beliefs, he offers the <i>Radical Self-Forgiveness</i> book and companion audio program. Join Colin Tipping to learn his step-by-step methods for going beyond the level of self-judgment and recrimination to the deeper spiritual state in which true forgiveness occurs.</p><p>What's "radical" about Colin Tipping's approach to forgiveness? "It's not about telling ourselves a new story about something that happened," he says. "It's about creating a profound shift at the spiritual level." Based on his world-renowned forgiveness workshops, the <i>Radical Self-Forgiveness</i><b>book</b> shares clear insights for resolving our deepest internal wounds using Tipping's five-stage forgiveness process. The <i>Radical Self-Forgiveness</i><b>audio</b> edition offers a toolbox of exercises, techniques, and guided practices designed to help us break the cycle of blame and victimhood&#x2015;an empowering attitude that helps us fully embrace every experience.</p><p>Many of our fears, anxieties, and even physical health problems originate from the parts of us that we consider unforgiveable. Yet when we recognize that we are worthy of forgiveness&#x2015;no matter who we are or what we have done&#x2015;we gain access to the loving energy of spirit that can heal our deepest wounds. Used alone or in combination for an integrated practice, the <i>Radical Self-Forgiveness</i> book and audio program open the doorway to the freedom and inner peace that come from true self-acceptance.</p></p><p><p>Colin Tipping was born in England and taught at London University before immigrating to the United States in 1984.

From war to ecological collapse, most of the world&#x2019;s critical problems stem from a distorted masculinity out of control. Yet our culture rewards the very dysfunctions responsible for those problems. To Matthew Fox, our crucial task is to open our minds to a deeper understanding of the healthy masculine than we receive from our media, culture, and religions. To awaken what Fox calls the sacred masculine,&#x201d; he unearths ten metaphors, or archetypes, to inspire men to pursue their higher calling to reinvent the world.</p><p>Matthew Fox was a member of the Dominican Order for 34 years. He holds a doctorate in the History and Theology of Spirituality from the Institut Catholique de Paris. He is the author of 28 books.Matthew Fox might well be the most creative, the most comprehensive, surely the most challenging religious-spiritual teacher in America.&#x201d;<br> Thomas Berry, author of <i>The Great Work</i><br><br> In <i>The Hidden Spirituality of Men</i> Matthew Fox has written a book designed to make all of us, men and women, more mindful of the spirit-streams in which we live our journeys, whether consciously or not. It is a gutsy, courageous book, one that confronts the terrible isolation in which men live with archetypal images that once nurtured, guided, and connected our ancestors and that still course within the depths of each of us. If we are to redeem our souls from the numbing banalities of our culture, we have to access spiritual values that enable us to give our lives to something worthy once more.&#x201d;<br> Dr. James Hollis, Jungian analyst and author of <i>What Matters Most: Living a More Considered Life</i><br><br> Every man on this planet should read this book not to mention every woman who wants to understand the struggles, often unconscious, that shape the men they know. If you want to understand what is out of whack in our culture from politics to personal life and how to heal and transform it, you&#x2019;ll rejoice in this book that combines the wisdom of the ages with the most forward-looking combination of feminist spirituality and contemporary psychological and philosophical reflections!&#x201d;<br> Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of <i>Tikkun</i> magazine, chair of the Network of Spiritual Progressives, and author of <i>The Left Hand of God</i><br><br> A wake-up call to shake us free from old stereotypes of masculinity, this book is good news and essential reading for men and those living in a world with men. Matthew Fox, at his most enlivening and insightful, describes, arouses, and liberates archetypal forms of male spirituality so desperately needed in these leaden times. These forms for embodying the sacred strengthen the warrior and the guardian within me as well. I know no better medicine for the mounting violence in our streets and in our hearts.&#x201d;<br> Joanna Macy, author of <i>World as Lover, World as Self</i><br><br> Matthew Fox, a one-of-a-kind voice, a wild man of religiosity, turns his loving heart toward emancipating modern men from an overculture that if left to itself would only use up men&#x2019;s blood and bones. Fox holds a different vision of the masculine as creative, voluptuous, and filled with spirit.&#x201d;<br> Clarissa Pinkola Est�s, PhD, author of <i>Women Who Run With the Wolves</i> and weekly columnist for the National Catholic Reporter Online (ncrcafe.org)<br><br> Once again, Matthew Fox brings his spiritual and earthly wisdom to the critical issues of our age. Fox shows how the challenges of humanity environment, conflict, and social justice are linked to the spiritual crisis faced by Western men. He demonstrates that we can start repairing our relationship with the earth and its citizens by repairing our own relationship with the sacred. <i>The Hidden Spirituality of Men</i> is essential reading for men who dream of becoming more effective agents of change, contributors to family and community, and warriors in the struggle to make the world a better place. Fox shows that if we wish to repair a world that faces crises of militarism, injustice, and ecological collapse, we must start with the conflicts and potential within ourselves and work outward from spiritual strength.&#x201d;<br> Rex Weyler, cofounder of Greenpeace International, author of <i>The Jesus Sayings</i>, and coauthor of <i>Chop Wood, Carry Water</i><br><br> Matthew Fox is a beacon of creative wisdom for our time! In this historic and revolutionary book, he inspires us to divinize male sexuality and exorcise the self-imposed and culturally held demons that bring violence and environmental desecration to our world.&#x201d;<br> Alex Grey, artist and author of <i>Sacred Mirrors</i>, <i>Transfigurations</i>, and <i>The Mission of Art</i><br><br> Matthew Fox&#x2019;s book is a magnificent masterpiece.&#x201d;<br> Andrew Harvey, author of <i>Son of Man</i> and <i>The Hope</i><br><br></p><h2>My Best Friend&#39;s Exorcism: A Novel</h2><p><b>An unholy hybrid of <i>Beaches</i> and <i>The Exorcist</i> that blends teen angst, adolescent drama, unspeakable horrors, and a mix of &#x2019;80s pop songs into a pulse-pounding supernatural thriller</b><br><br>The year is 1988.

It takes her to the homepage of the paper she still thinks&nbsp;of as the News and Courier, even though it changed its name fifteen&nbsp;years ago. There&#x2019;s the exorcist floating in the middle of her&nbsp;screen, balding and with a ponytail, smiling at the camera in a&nbsp;blurry headshot the size of a postage stamp. Abby&#x2019;s jaw aches and&nbsp;her throat gets tight. She doesn&#x2019;t realize she&#x2019;s stopped breathing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The exorcist was driving some lumber up to Lakewood and&nbsp;stopped on I-95 to help a tourist change his tire. He was tightening&nbsp;the lug nuts when a Dodge Caravan swerved onto the shoulder and&nbsp;hit him full-on. He died before the ambulance arrived. The woman&nbsp;driving the minivan had three different painkillers in her system&#x2014;four if you included Bud Light.

Those highway safety billboards covered South Carolina&nbsp;when she was in high school; and in that instant, her office, the&nbsp;conference call she has at eleven, her apartment, her mortgage, her&nbsp;divorce, her daughter&#x2014;none of it matters.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s twenty years ago and she&#x2019;s bombing over the old bridge in&nbsp;a crapped-out Volkswagen Rabbit, windows down, radio blasting&nbsp;UB40, the air sweet and salty in her face. She turns her head to the&nbsp;right and sees Gretchen riding shotgun, the wind tossing her blond&nbsp;hair, shoes off, sitting Indian style on the seat, and they&#x2019;re singing&nbsp;along to the radio at the top of their tuneless lungs. It&#x2019;s April 1988&nbsp;and the world belongs to them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Abby, &#x201c;friend&#x201d; is a word whose sharp corners have been&nbsp;worn smooth by overuse. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m friends with the guys in IT,&#x201d; she&nbsp;might say, or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting some friends after work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she remembers when the word &#x201c;friend&#x201d; could draw blood.&nbsp;She and Gretchen spent hours ranking their friendships, trying to&nbsp;determine who was a best friend and who was an everyday friend,&nbsp;debating whether anyone could have two best friends at the same&nbsp;time, writing each other&#x2019;s names over and over in purple ink,&nbsp;buzzed on the dopamine high of belonging to someone else, having&nbsp;a total stranger choose you, someone who wanted to know you,&nbsp;another person who cared that you were alive.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She and Gretchen were best friends, and then came that fall.&nbsp;And they fell.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the exorcist saved her life.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abby still remembers high school, but she remembers it as&nbsp;images, not events.

But even with all the bizarre, disturbing things he&#x2019;d seen, he had still assumed that the brutal punishments were designed to intimidate. Not exterminate. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d been so calm, willingly letting them guide him along blindfolded and gagged, right up until the moment they&#x2019;d sliced his palm.<br> What if this particular test was no different? Maybe he was doing exactly what they wanted him to, running through the trees like a trophy animal. They had only cut his hand. No arteries. Plus, he&#x2019;d surprised himself, getting away from the two men holding him, one of them enormous, much bigger than any of the adults he&#x2019;d seen there. Had they purposely let him go? No, he shouldn&#x2019;t sell himself short. He&#x2019;d fought like hell. <br> The boy felt a flash of pride.

He started to climb without thinking, pain exploding as the metal wire slipped into his open wound. He stifled a scream, hoping to conceal his exact point of escape. While clenching his jaw to summon the resolve to hoist himself up the ten foot barrier, he saw it: a cut section of fence not five steps away. <br> <i>Lucky.</i><br> As he pushed his way through the flap and stood up in the pasture, he heard the roar of an engine to his left. A pickup truck was hurtling across the pasture in his direction. <br> They were trying to head him off. <br> He broke into a sprint toward the cover of trees on the side of the pasture, seeing his own shadow in front of him as the headlights shone on his back. He was confident in his speed. Ninety-ninth percentile in the President&#x2019;s Challenge Shuttle Run. He&#x2019;d timed himself.<br> But they were closing the distance fast. <br> <i>Get to the treeline. </i><br> He knew there&#x2019;d be a barbed wire cow fence at the edge of the field. He&#x2019;d have to clear it in stride.<br> In only a matter of seconds, they were upon him. <br> He was steps from the trees.<br> The headlights lit up the short fence, helping him judge his distance. He stutter-stepped to setup his leap, then threw his lead leg in the air. <br> A clean jump. <br> He heard the truck skid to a stop on the wet grass behind him, the doors opening. Men screaming.<br> He knew this stretch of forest well; there was barely a patch of nature around town he hadn&#x2019;t explored on his own. Another hundred feet or so and he&#x2019;d make it to the clearing. <br> He broke into the wide lane cut through the forest, a grassy corridor that followed the sewage line to the water treatment plant. He heard the men clumsily moving through the woods, crashing into branches and grumbling to themselves.<br> <i>Morons.</i><br> Randomly choosing a direction, he dashed down the clearing, reaching a manhole in less than fifty steps. He grabbed a nearby stick and jammed it into the notch on the cover, just as he&#x2019;d done a thousand times before, no longer thinking about his throbbing hand. The weighty metal disc lifted, at which point he grabbed the underside and raised the lid on its edge, releasing an acrid smell. He swiftly stepped down into the rank darkness below, skittering down the iron rungs as fast as he could.<br> The disheveled men popped out of the trees ten seconds after he&#x2019;d dropped the manhole cover in place.<br> The boy listened as their cursing voices passed him.<br> He waited until he could no longer hear them, and then sat for another five minutes. <br> He hoisted the cover, emerging into the muggy night air.<br> The boy fled deeper into the woods.</p><h2>Day of Tears (Coretta Scott King Author Honor Title)</h2><p><br>On March 2 and 3, 1859, the largest auction of slaves in American history took place in Savannah, Georgia. More than 400 slaves were sold. On the first day of the auction, the skies darkened and torrential rain began falling. The rain continued throughout the two days, stopping only when the auction had ended. The simultaneity of the rain storm with the auction led to these two days being called "the weeping time." Master storyteller Julius Lester has taken this footnote of history and created the crowning achievement of his literary career.<br> <br>Julius Lester tells the story of several characters including Emma, a slave owned by Pierce Butler and caretaker of his two daughters, and Pierce, a man with a mounting gambling debt and household to protect. Emma wants to teach his daughters-one who opposes slavery and one who supports it-to have kind hearts. Meanwhile, in a desperate bid to survive, Pierce decides to cash in his "assets" and host the largest slave auction in American history. And on that day, the skies open up and weep endlessly on the proceedings below.<br><br>Using the multiple voices of enslaved Africans <i>and</i> their owners, Julius Lester has taken a little-known, all-true event in American history and transformed it into a heartbreaking and powerfully dramatic epic on slavery, and the struggle to affirm humanity in the midst of it.</p><p>Julius Lester turned to writing after spending time as a photographer, musician, and political activist in the 1960s. His more than forty books for adults and children have garnered many awards, including ALA Notable citations and a Coretta Scott King Honor. <i>To Be a Slave </i>was a Newbery Honor Book, and <i>John Henry</i> received a <em>Boston</em><em> Globe-Horn Book</em> award and a Caldecott Honor<i>.</i>Transported to the largest slave auction in U.S. history, listeners feel the anguish of riven families, the greed of buyers and sellers. Lester's novel is a "paradigm for the thousands of slave auctions." Written like a play, the work has each reader, with well-honed accents, tell his or her role in the 1859 auction in which Pierce Butler sold his inheritance of 429 slaves, once considered family, in two days to cover gambling debts. A narrator grimly lists the sale records. Interludes offer reflections from years later by Butler, his daughters, and his abolitionist ex-wife, as well as several slaves who escaped via the Underground Railroad. Rain falls in torrents throughout the sale; a slave comments, "This ain't rain, this is God's tears."

Starting in the present day and moving backward, the novel is told in the voices of the three women: fifteen-year-old part-black Rayona; her American Indian mother, Christine, consumed by tenderness and resentment toward those she loves; and the fierce and mysterious Ida, mother and grandmother whose haunting secrets, betrayals, and dreams echo through the years, braiding together the strands of the shared past.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Dorris</b>'s adult fiction includes <i>The Cloud Chamber</i>, <i>The Crown of Columbus</i>, coauthored with Louise Erdrich, and the story collection <i>Working Men</i>. Among his nonfiction works are <i>The Broken Cord</i>, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, and a collection of essays, <i>Paper Trail.</i></p>Critics have described Michael Dorris's acclaimed debut as a braid: Each life is one strand interwoven to create a whole. To uphold that imagery, Barbara Rosenblat becomes three women in one for this production. She begins as Rayona, a teenager experiencing growing pains while dealing with her mother's illness. As Christine nears death, mother and daughter return to the reservation. With ease, Rosenblat switches from the higher, innocent voice of young Rayona to the gruffer, brassy voice of Christine, a woman who has always acted impulsively on her heart's desires. The final third of the book is Ida's story, the past that brings truth to the present. While her Native American inflection does not sound authentic, Rosenblat fittingly uses a deep, cold, snappish tone to convey the matriarchal character. Three strong women, one strong voice tells their story.

If they were to meet today, what would each think of the other&#39;s spiritual views and practices? This book explores how the two traditions meet and awakens an understanding of both.</p><p>If you have always assumed that Christianity and Buddhism are as far apart philosophically as their respective founders were geographically, you may be in for a bit of a surprise. In this national bestseller, Zen monk and social activist Thich Nhat Hanh draws parallels between these two traditions that have them walking, hand in hand, down the same path to salvation. In Christianity, he finds mindfulness in the Holy Spirit as an agent of healing. In Buddhism, he finds unqualified love in the form of compassion for all living things. And in both he finds an emphasis on living practice and community spirit. <p> The thread that binds the book is the same theme that draws many Christians toward Buddhism: mindfulness. Through anecdotes, scripture references, and teachings from both traditions, Nhat Hanh points out that mindfulness is an integral part of all religious practice and teaches us how to cultivate it in our own lives. Nhat Hanh has no desire to downplay the venerable theological and ritual teachings that distinguish Buddhism and Christianity, but he does cause one to consider that beyond the letter of doctrine lies a unity of truth.</p>Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese Buddhist Zen Master, poet, scholar and peace activist. During the Vietnam War his work for peace and reconciliation moved Martin Luther King to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967. He founded the Van Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon and the School of Youth for Social Service. He was exiled as a result of his work for peace but continued his activism, rescuing boat people and helping to resettle Vietnamese refugees. He has written more than 100 books, which have sold millions of copies around the world. He now lives in France where he founded a Buddhist community and meditation centre.</p><h2>The Alexiad (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A revised edition of a medieval masterpiece&#x2014;the first narrative history written by a woman</b><br><br> Written between 1143 and 1153 by the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos,&nbsp;<i>The Alexiad</i>&nbsp;is one of the most popular and revealing primary sources in the vast canon of medieval literature.

And yet, sex in our world today looks nothing like the way that God intended it to be. Sexual brokenness surrounds us and, in one way or another, affects us all.</p> <p>This sexual brokenness reveals our deep need for redemption--something quick fixes, mere behavior modification, or a set of rules can't provide. Honest and direct yet kind and caring, this book points us to the only place we can find help for sexual brokenness--the transforming grace of Jesus Christ. Only this grace offers hope for a life of freedom, purity, and joy as God intended.</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul David Tripp</strong> (DMin, Westminster Theological Seminary) is a pastor, author, and international conference speaker.

DeHaas</strong><strong>,</strong> CEO, Covenant Eyes, Inc.</p><p>&#x201c;Paul Tripp&#x2019;s writing always challenges, encourages, and inspires me. <i>Sex in a Broken World</i> did just that. Sexuality can be beautiful, but it&#x2019;s also broken, so we have to be honest about the topic.

Paul Tripp, who has to be one of our generation&#x2019;s most insightful Christian thinkers, asks questions in this book that few people of faith dare to ask: Why did God create me with unfulfilled desires? Why do I so often feel disappointed? What does God really feel toward me when I fall to those same temptations again and again?

How can it bring needlework to life? Crafters will uncover the possibilities in this unique, in-depth exploration of color in embroidery. From color selection and blending to choosing complimentary colors and creative contrasting and shading, it highlights a variety of techniques for surface and counted thread embroidery projects. More than 200 stitched examples with DMC thread keys, plus color schemes and projects such as roses, fruits, and birds will inspire stitchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Trish Burr</b> is the author of the highly successful <i>Redoute's Finest Flowers in Embroidery</i> (2002), <i>Long and Short Stitch Embroidery: A Collection of Flowers</i> (2006), <i>Crewel &amp; Surface Embroidery-Inspirational Floral Designs</i> (2008), <i>Needle Painting Embroidery-Fresh Ideas for Beginners</i>, and <i>The Long &amp; the Short of it-A Needle Painting Workshop</i> (DVD), all published by Sally Milner Publishing.<br>Apr/May 12 Stitching is a very practical craft and it can be done in a simplistic way. Sometimes a piece of work relies on the choice of stitches used to work it and sometimes the texture of the threads plays an important role. But the use of colour affects the piece more than anything else. To achieve a painterly shaded effect, long and short stitch is usually the stitch of choice, but elements such as the type of thread and the direction of the stitches contribute to the look of the finished embroidery. The rougher fibres of wool yarns such as crewel wool absorb more light so that little imperfections don&#39;t show, while smooth surfaces such as silk reflect the light and are less forgiving. In many ways, this book is as much about art as it is about stitching. The colour exercises are very effective and demonstrate the subtleties that shading can bring, adding light or shadows and sometimes making the highlights shine. Beautifully illustrated with clear photos, there are 12 projects, each of which focuses on a particular colour range, plus a glorious Sacred Kingfisher that uses all of the techniques - and is a challenge for more advanced stitchers... or perhaps for stitchers who have worked their way through the exercises and other projects in the book. This book really puts the &#39;art&#39; into embroidery and teaches you all you need to know about &#39;painting&#39; with a needle and thread. * Stitch *</p><h2>Young Frankenstein: The Story of the Making of the Film</h2><p><b>Mel Brooks' own words telling all about the players, the filming, and studio antics during the production of this great comedy classic.

G.E.O. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Wind in the Willows (Dover Children&#39;s Evergreen Classics)</h2><p><p>Generations of children have roamed the English countryside in the company of Rat, Mole, Toad, and Badger, the immortal animal friends of <i>The Wind in the Willows. </i>From their genesis nearly a century ago as bedtime stories for the author's young son, these timeless tales of friendship amid the natural world have captivated readers of all ages.<br>The adventures begin when Mole, feeling all the restlessness that springtime brings, abandons his burrow to discover the magic of the great river. With the able assistance of Rat, Mole learns to row and swim, and the chums fill their idyllic days with summertime rambles along the river and cozy fireside feasts on crisp nights. The pair take to the open road with the pleasure-loving Toad, track reclusive Badger to his snug lair, and stand together to reclaim Toad Hall from an invasion of stoats, ferrets, and weasels.<br>This memorable collection of stories, now available in an inexpensive and unabridged edition, offers a joyful retreat to a rustic world of wonders. Young readers (and listeners) will want to return again and again to the ageless charm of Kenneth Grahame's childhood classic.<br></p><p></p></p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud. Grahame's <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> has enchanted readers for four generations, and this lavishly illustrated gift edition is perhaps the finest around. <i>(All ages, or 9 to 12)</i> <p>This reviews refers to ISBN 0805002138.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Buffettology: The Previously Unexplained Techniques That Have Made Warren Buffett The Worlds</h2><p>In the world of investing, the name Warren Buffett is synonymous with success and prosperity. Learn how Warren Buffett did it&#x2014;and how you can too.<br><br>Building from the ground up, Buffett chose wisely and picked his stocks with care, in turn amassing the huge fortune for which he is now famous. Mary Buffett, former daughter-in-law of this legendary financial genius and a successful businesswoman in her own right, has teamed up with noted Buffettologist David Clark to create <i>Buffettology,</i> a one-of-a-kind investment guide that explains the winning strategies of the master.<br> <br> * Learn how to approach investing the way Buffett does, based on the authors' firsthand knowledge of the secrets that have made Buffett the world's second wealthiest man<br> * Use Buffett's proven method of investing in stocks that will continue to grow over time<br> * Master the straightforward mathematical equipments that assist Buffett in making investments<br> * Examine the kinds of companies that capture Buffett's interest, and learn how you can use this information to make your own investment choices of the future<br> <br> Complete with profiles of fifty-four "Buffett companies" -- companies in which Buffett has invested and which the authors believe he continues to follow -- <i>Buffettology</i> can show any investor, from beginner to savvy pro, how to create a profitable portfolio.</p><p>Americans are infatuated with the stock market. The number of households that own stock has increased from around 20 percent in the early 1980s to over 40 percent today. The market offers the hope of quick wealth and early retirement, and just about everyone who is in the market is looking for an edge, from sources such as CNBC and <i>Wall Street Week</i> to the Beardstown Ladies and "The Motley Fool." So it should be no surprise the most successful investor of our time--Warren Buffett--has been the subject of dozens of books and magazine articles. The value of Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, has increased from $18 per share in 1965 to over $70,000 per share today. The interest in Buffett has spawned an approach to investing called "Buffettology," which is the subject of a book by the same name written by Buffett's former daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett. <p> In <i>Buffettology</i>, Mary Buffett, with the help of David Clark, details Warren Buffett's approach to investing. It's a style of investing based on the work of Benjamin Graham and one that requires a quality that most investors lack--discipline. Mary Buffett writes, "As you read through this book you will come to see that having a business perspective on investing is more about discipline than philosophy.... In short, other people's follies, brought on by fear and greed, will offer you, the investor, the opportunity to take advantage of their mistakes and benefit from the discipline of committing capital to investment only when it makes sense from a business perspective.... You will find that almost everything that relates to business perspective investing is alien to Wall Street folklore.</p> <p> <i>Buffettology</i> examines Buffett's methods for valuing companies and selecting stocks--it even encourages you to buy a calculator and work through the valuation formulas that Buffett uses when researching companies to buy. The book not only serves as a useful guide to understanding how Buffett invests, it's an excellent primer to investing in stocks, whether you plan to become a Buffettologist or not. Highly recommended. --<i>Harry C.

There he falls in love and marries - and then dies suddenly in suspicious circumstances.<br><br>Before long, the new widow - Philip's cousin Rachel - arrives in England. Despite himself, Philip is drawn to this beautiful, mysterious woman. But could she have masterminded Ambrose's death?</p><p><i>My Cousin Rachel</i> is the gripping story of a Victorian young man whose placid life in the English countryside is turned inside-out by an older woman. The young man is Philip Ashley, the novel�s narrator. Orphaned at an early age, he�s been raised by his bachelor uncle Ambrose, who falls in love and marries while traveling in Florence, then dies there in suspicious circumstances. Shortly after her husband�s death, Ambrose�s widow turns up in England, setting the stage for the unfolding of a relationship between the callow Philip and the beautiful, sophisticated, mysterious widow. And while Philip impetuously embraces the role of the moth flapping full-tilt toward the flame, the widow never puts a foot wrong. Is she designedly luring Philip to his doom? Might she even have had a hand in Ambrose�s death? Originally published in 1951, <i>My Cousin Rachel</i> was made into a film in 1953.Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel,<i>The Loving Spirit</i>, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel<i>Rebecca</i>that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.<br>Many of du Maurier's bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock's<i>The Birds</i>and Nicolas Roeg's<i>Don't Look Now</i>. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE. She lived most of her life in Cornwall, the setting for many of her books.</p><h2>The Islandman (Oxford Paperbacks Series)</h2><p>Tomas O'Crohan was born on the Great Blasket Island in 1865 and died there in 1937, a great master of his native Irish. He shared to the full the perilous life of a primitive community, yet possessed a shrewd and humorous detachment that enabled him to observe and describe the world. His book is a valuable description of a now vanished way of life; his sole purpose in writing it was in his own words, 'to set down the character of the people about me so that some record of us might live after us, for the like of us will never be again'.<br><br>The Blasket Islands are three miles off Irelands Dingle Peninsula. Until their evacuation just after the Second World War, the lives of the 150 or so Blasket Islanders had remained unchanged for centuries. A rich oral tradition of story-telling, poetry, and folktales kept alive the legends and history of the islands, and has made their literature famous throughout the world. The 7 Blasket Island books published by OUP contain memoirs and reminiscences from within this literary tradition, evoking a way of life which has now vanished.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)`Part of a unique and remarkable Irish literary archive ... compelling.'<br>Neil Johnston, Belfast Telegraph, 24/6/00</p><h2>Hamlet (Picture This!

Zac Hicks gives us a clear guide to leading worship, one that takes the pastoral call seriously.</p><p>Zac Hicks is Canon for Worship and Liturgy at Cathedral Church of the Advent (Birmingham, AL). He writes regularly at zachicks.com. He and his wife, Abby, have been married for over fifteen years and have four children. @zachicksThe modern role of the worship leader ... has emerged in recent years as a mission-critical position on church staffs&#x201d; so writes Zac Hicks. But how do we characterize that role ... rock star, attendance stoker, culture broker, generational appeaser? With years of contemporary worship-leading experience, theological acumen, love of the church, and profound respect for the calling of leading God&#x2019;s people in declaring his glory, Hicks identifies the role as &#x201c;pastor.&#x201d; That description is not a power-grab, but a humble acknowledgement of the sacredness of a task with so many heart implications for the people of God. Hicks explores perspectives that will inspire worship leaders and ennoble the worship practices and priorities of God&#x2019;s people. -- Bryan Chapell, Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church; Author, Christ-centered Worship and Christ-centered Preaching<br><br>I&#x2019;ve said it publically, so now I&#x2019;ll document it. If I could choose one worship pastor to serve with for the rest of my life it would be Zac Hicks. Marinate in his book, Worship Pastor, and you&#x2019;ll understand why my words aren&#x2019;t pastoral hyperbole. I&#x2019;ve never met a worship leader, of any age, who simultaneously exudes such a heart-enflaming grasp of the gospel and great theological care, a deep affection for Christ&#x2019;s church and a passion for corporate worship, creativity in building liturgy and joy in leading a service, an infectious love for his team and humility as a lead worshiper. No, this isn&#x2019;t Zac&#x2019;s eulogy; it&#x2019;s an introduction to a great book. Get it; soak in it; share it with many. -- Scotty Smith, Teacher in Residence, West End Community Church, Nashville TN<br><br>FINALLY! Long has the worship community needed a guidebook for those understanding the role of the worship leader encompasses more than great music. This volume clearly defines the responsibilities worship pastors have to the body of Christ as: theologian, disciple, worshiper, evangelist, mentor, artist, counselor, musician, servant leader, and producer. Zac Hicks skillfully &#x201c;pours himself&#x201d; into every page of this book. He explains how these multiple roles, when merged together, define &#x201c;the call&#x201d; to pastor, nurture, disciple and love those entrusted to the care of the worship leader. Well written. Passionate. Insightful. Engaging. I highly recommend The Worship Pastor to anyone seeking to follow God&#x2019;s call to lead worship. -- Dr. Vernon M. Whaley, Dean, School of Music, Liberty University<br><br>As the 'worship pastor' becomes a standard job title in local churches across the globe, we are in dire need of a guide for this unique vocation. Gleaning from the best Biblical, historical, and liturgical models, Zac Hicks has given us a masterpiece that is equal parts manual and manifesto. The fruit of Zac's faithful life and work as both a scholar and a worship pastor, this book is both theologically rich and readily applicable. It is pastoral theology at its very best. -- Glenn Packiam, Pastor, New Life Downtown; Author of Discover the Mystery of Faith and Secondhand Jesus<br><br>The position of the worship leader has morphed into a highly influential place in church life over the past two centuries. Unfortunately, the actual role has often been relegated to picking a few songs, and not much more. Zac Hicks has laid down some important principles for worship leaders to function beyond merely choosing songs &#x2013; as pastors. Worship leaders can have lasting, formative impact on congregational life &#x2013; pastoring from the platform, as well as in relationships with those they serve. Worship leaders who will adapt Zac&#x2019;s principles and disciplines will find that their call to ministry will be widely enhanced...to the Glory of God. -- Dr. Edwin M. Willmington, Director of the Brehm Center for Worship, Theology, and the Arts, Fuller Seminary<br><br>It&#x2019;s been 50 years since the first forms of contemporary worship. It&#x2019;s been 30 years since the position of &#x201c;worship leader&#x201d; developed. It&#x2019;s been 20 years since mainline churches adopted contemporary styles. And so it&#x2019;s time for a mature, multifaceted guide for those who have the stewardship for leading God&#x2019;s people in this worship. Zac Hicks&#x2019; The Worship Pastor fills that need wonderfully. -- Lester Ruth, Research Professor of Christian Worship, Duke Divinity School<br><br>This is book is an invitation to fundamentally re-envision the very identity of all of us who lead God's people in worship. We not are called to be performers and spiritual engineers. Rather, we are graced with the profound opportunity to shape a gifted response to the triune God, walking in step with God's Holy Spirit to give shape to the reception of God's Word and the response of God's people. My prayer is that this book will encourage and inspire both beginning and lifelong leaders of God's people, and lead to worship of greater theological depth and Christian joy. -- John D.

These proletarian heroes, with names like Lonnie, Loo, Sweet Pea, and Packy, work the furnaces, forges, slag heaps, assembly lines, and loading docks at places with unglamorous names like Brass Craft or Feinberg and Breslin&#x2019;s First-Rate Plumbing and Plating. Only Studs Terkel&#x2019;s <i>Working</i> approaches the pathos and beauty of this book. But Levine&#x2019;s characters are also significant for their inner lives, not merely their jobs. They are unusually artistic, living &#x2018;at the borders of dreams.&#x2019; One reads <i>The Tempest </i>&#x2018;slowly to himself&#x2019;; another ponders a diagonal chalk line drawn by his teacher to suggest a triangle, the roof of a barn, or the mysterious separation of &#x2018;the dark from the dark.&#x2019; <i>What Work Is</i> ranks as a major work by a major poet . . . very accessible and utterly American in tone and language.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Daniel L. Guillory, <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>If there is such a thing as a working man's poet, then Philip Levine is it. Born into a blue-collar family in Detroit, Levine grew up amidst the steel mills and auto factories of Motor City. Laboring in the plants radicalized both Levine's politics and his art; in early works such as <i>On the Edge</i> and <i>Not This Pig</i>, he explored the gritty despair of urban working-class life, a reality that has continued to run through his later poetry as well. In his 1991 National Book Award-winning <i>What Work Is</i>, Levine revisits the scenes of his youth--only now the factories are shut down, the towns that depended on them devastated. In the title poem, Levine conveys a multitude of meaning in the single image of men standing in line waiting for work: <blockquote> the sad refusal to give in to<br> rain, to the hours wasted waiting,<br> to the knowledge that somewhere ahead<br> a man is waiting who will say, "No,<br> we're not hiring today," for any<br> reason he wants. </blockquote> Factory workers aren't the only subjects here, however; in "Among Children" (an American response to Yeats's "Among School Children") Levine contemplates "the children of Flint, their fathers / work at the spark plug factory or truck / bottled water in 5 gallon sea-blue jugs / to the widows of the suburbs." For these children, he contends, the Book of Job would be the most appropriate reading. <p> What work is, Levine tells us, is the accretion of a lifetime of experiences, compromises, and disappointments. It is drinking gin for the first time at 14, a premature leap into manhood; it is that first job with its double-edged promise of a "new life of working and earning," and later the unrealized dreams of escaping that life. Levine's poems move back and forth in time, touch on issues of race, religion, education--even gardening--and leave the reader with a moving portrait of working-class life from the 1940s to the present day. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Philip Levine was born in 1928 in Detroit and was formally educated there, in the public schools and at Wayne University (now Wayne State University). After a succession of industrial jobs, he left the city for good and lived in various parts of the country before settling in Fresno, California, where he taught at the state university until his retirement. For twelve autumns he served as poet in residence at New York University. He has received many awards for his books of poems, including the National Book Award in 1991 for <i>What Work Is</i> and the Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for <i>The Simple Truth. </i>In 2011 he was appointed Poet Laureate of the United States. He divides his time between Fresno, California, and Brooklyn, New York.</p><h2>Precalculus With Trigonometry: Concepts and Connections</h2><p>2003 Precalculus with Trigonometry: Concepts and Applications (H) by Paul A.

Burroughs, extensive text commentary by Ballard, and four additional stories. Of specific interest are the illustrations by underground cartoonist and professional medical illustrator Phoebe Gloeckner. Her ultrarealistic images of eroticism and destruction add an important dimension to Ballard's text.When the Atrocity Exhibition was originally printed (1970), Nelson Doubleday saw a copy and was so horrified he ordered the entire press run shredded. Two years later Grove Press brought out a small hardback printing re-titled &#34;Love and Napalm: Export USA.&#34; Now Re/Search brings out an illustrated, large-format edition of this notorious work, augmented with four recently written stories, plus extensive annotations--written by the author, never before published--which clarify and illuminate this exhilarating, prophetic masterpiece.</p><h2>Physics for Scientists and Engineers</h2><p><p><b> </b>Physics for Scientists and Engineers combines outstanding pedagogy with a clear and direct narrative and applications that draw the reader into the physics.

They stood uneasily, without any certainty, in the large lovely entrance hall, and watched Mrs. Halloran go into the right wing of the house to let Mr. Halloran know that Lionel&#x2019;s last rites had gone off without melodrama. Young Mrs. Halloran, looking after her mother-in-law, said without hope, &#x201c;Maybe she will drop dead on the doorstep. Fancy, dear, would you like to see Granny drop dead on the doorstep?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, mother.&#x201d; Fancy pulled at the long skirt of the black dress her grandmother had put on her. Young Mrs. Halloran felt that black was not suitable for a ten-year-old girl, and that the dress was too long in any case, and certainly too plain and coarse for a family of the Halloran prestige; she had had an asthma attack on the very morning of the funeral to prove her point, but Fancy had been put into the black dress nevertheless. The long black skirt had entertained her during the funeral, and in the car, and if it had not been for her grandmother&#x2019;s presence she might very well have enjoyed the day absolutely.</p><p>&#x201c;I am going to pray for it as long as I live,&#x201d; said young Mrs. Halloran, folding her hands together devoutly.</p><p>&#x201c;Shall I push her?&#x201d; Fancy asked. &#x201c;Like she pushed my daddy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fancy!&#x201d; said Miss Ogilvie.</p><p>&#x201c;Let her say it if she wants,&#x201d; young Mrs. Halloran said. &#x201c;I want her to remember it, anyway. Say it again, Fancy baby.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Granny killed my daddy,&#x201d; said Fancy obediently. &#x201c;She pushed him down the stairs and killed him. Granny did it. Didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Ogilvie raised her eyes to heaven, but lowered her voice in respect for the sad occasion of the day, &#x201c;Maryjane,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you are perverting that child&#x2019;s mind and very possibly ruining her chances of inheriting&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On this day,&#x201d; young Mrs. Halloran said, putting her mouse face into an expression of reproachful dignity, &#x201c;I want it clearly understood by all of you, everyone here, and remembered always, <i>if</i> you don&#x2019;t mind. Fancy is a fatherless orphan today because that nasty old woman couldn&#x2019;t <i>stand</i> it if the house belonged to anyone else and I was still a wife, a beloved helpmeet.&#x201d; She breathed shallowly, and pressed her hands to her chest. &#x201c;Pushed him down the stairs,&#x201d; she said sullenly.</p><p>&#x201c;The king, thy murdered father&#x2019;s ghost,&#x201d; Essex said to Fancy. He yawned, and moved on the velvet bench, and stretched. &#x201c;Where are the funeral baked meats? The old woman can&#x2019;t be planning to starve us, now she&#x2019;s got it all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is unspeakable,&#x201d; said young Mrs. Halloran, &#x201c;to think of food, with Lionel barely cold. Fancy,&#x201d; and she held out her hand. Fancy moved unwillingly, her long black skirt swinging, and young Mrs. Halloran turned to the great stairway. &#x201c;My place now is with my fatherless orphaned child,&#x201d; she said over her shoulder. &#x201c;They must send my dinner up with Fancy&#x2019;s. Anyway I believe I am going to have more asthma.&#x201d;</p><p><i>WHEN SHALL WE LIVE IF NOT NOW?</i> was painted in black gothic letters touched with gold over the arched window at the landing on the great stairway; young Mrs. Halloran paused before the window and turned, Fancy toiling upward still, entangled in her skirt. &#x201c;My grief,&#x201d; young Mrs. Halloran said, one hand on her breast and the other barely touching the wide polished handrail, &#x201c;my lasting grief. Hurry <i>up</i>, Fancy.&#x201d; Together, young Mrs. Halloran leaning lightly upon the shoulder of her daughter, they moved out of sight down the hall, into the vastness of the upper left wing which, until so recently, they had shared with Lionel.</p><p>Essex looked after them with distaste. &#x201c;I should think Lionel would have welcomed the thought of dying,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be vulgar,&#x201d; said Miss Ogilvie. &#x201c;Even with me, please remember that we are employees, not members of the family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I</i> am here, however, if you please,&#x201d; Aunt Fanny said suddenly from the darkest corner of the hall. &#x201c;You will of course have overlooked the fact that Aunt Fanny is here, but I beg of you, do not inhibit your conversation on <i>my</i> account. I am a member of the family, surely, but that need not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Essex yawned again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder if it will be a proper dinner? This is the first funeral since I&#x2019;ve been here,&#x201d; Miss Ogilvie said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;m not sure how she manages. I suppose we&#x2019;ll sit down, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one will waste a minute&#x2019;s thought if Aunt Fanny stays safely in her room,&#x201d; Aunt Fanny said. &#x201c;Tell my brother&#x2019;s wife,&#x201d; she said to Essex, &#x201c;that I will join her in grief after dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My first funeral, too,&#x201d; Essex said. Lazily, he stood up and stretched again. &#x201c;Makes you sleepy. You think the old lady&#x2019;s locked up the gin in honor of the day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll have plenty in the kitchen,&#x201d; Miss Ogilvie said. &#x201c;But just a teensy one for me, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>_____</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said. She stood behind her husband&#x2019;s wheel chair, looking down onto the back of his head with no need, now, to control her boredom. Before Mr. Halloran had become permanently established in his wheel chair Mrs. Halloran had frequently found it difficult to restrain her face, or the small withdrawing gestures of her hands, but now that Mr. Halloran was in the wheel chair, and could not turn quickly, Mrs. Halloran was always graceful with him, standing protectively behind him and keeping her voice gentle.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone, Richard,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everything went off beautifully.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Halloran had been crying, but this was not unusual; since he had been made to realize that he would not, now, be vouchsafed a second run at youth he cried easily and often. &#x201c;My only son,&#x201d; Mr. Halloran said, whispering.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran forebade her fingers to drum restlessly upon the back of the wheel chair; one should not fidget in the presence of an invalid; in the presence of an old man imprisoned in a wheel chair one ought not to be impatient. Mrs. Halloran sighed, soundlessly. &#x201c;Try to be brave,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember,&#x201d; Mr. Halloran asked, quavering, &#x201c;when he was born, we rang the bells over the carriage house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed we did,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said heartily. &#x201c;I can have the bells rung again, if you like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think not,&#x201d; Mr. Halloran said. &#x201c;I think not. They might not understand, down in the village, and we must not indulge our own sentimental memories at the expense of public opinion. I think not. In any case,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;the bells are not loud enough to reach Lionel now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now that Lionel is gone,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said, &#x201c;I am going to have to get someone to manage the estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lionel did it very poorly. At one time the rose garden was perfectly visible from my terrace, and now I can only see hedges. I want the hedges all cut down. At once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are not to excite yourself, Richard. You were always a good father, and I will have the hedges trimmed.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Halloran stirred, and his eyes filled again with tears. &#x201c;Do you remember,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I wanted to keep his curls?&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Halloran put a little wistful smile on her face and came around the wheel chair to look at her husband. &#x201c;Dear Richard,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This is not healthy for you. I know that Lionel loved you better than anyone in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not proper,&#x201d; Mr. Halloran said. &#x201c;Lionel has a wife and child, now, and his father must no longer come first. Orianna, you must speak to Lionel. Tell him that I will not have it. His first, his only duty is to the good woman he married, and his sweet child. Tell Lionel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He stopped uncertainly. &#x201c;<i>Is</i> it Lionel who died?&#x201d; he asked after a minute.</p><p>Mrs. Halloran moved around to the back of the wheel chair and permitted herself to close her eyes tiredly. Lifting her hand with deliberation, she put it down softly onto her husband&#x2019;s shoulder, and said, &#x201c;His funeral went off very well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember,&#x201d; the old man said, &#x201c;we rang the bells over the carriage house when he was born?&#x201d;</p><p>_____</p><p>Mrs. Halloran set her wine glass down very quietly, looked from Essex to Miss Ogilvie and said, &#x201c;Aunt Fanny will be down for dessert?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Adding the final touch of jubilation to a day of perfect happiness,&#x201d; Essex said.</p><p>Mrs. Halloran looked at him for a minute. &#x201c;At such a remark,&#x201d; she said finally, &#x201c;Lionel would have found it necessary to remind you that you were not here to be ironic, but to paint murals in the breakfast room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Orianna <i>dear</i>,&#x201d; said Essex with a little false laugh, &#x201c;I had not suspected you of fallibility; the one painting murals in the breakfast room was the <i>last</i> young man; <i>I</i> am the young man who is supposed to be cataloguing the library.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lionel wouldn&#x2019;t have known,&#x201d; Miss Ogilvie said, and turned pink.</p><p>&#x201c;But he would have suspected,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said agreeably, and then, &#x201c;Aunt Fanny is at the door; I hear her little cough. Essex, go and let her in, or she will never bring herself to turn the doorknob.&#x201d;</p><p>Essex opened the door with a flourish; &#x201c;Good evening, Aunt Fanny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope this sad day has agreed with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one needs to worry over me, thank you. Good evening, Orianna, Miss Ogilvie. Please don&#x2019;t bother, really; you know perfectly well Aunt Fanny is not one to worry over. Orianna, I shall be glad to stand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Essex,&#x201d; said Mrs. Halloran, &#x201c;set a chair for Aunt Fanny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the young man would rather not, Orianna. I am accustomed to taking care of myself, as <i>you</i> have surely discovered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A glass of wine for Aunt Fanny, Essex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I take wine only with my equals, Orianna. My brother Richard&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is resting. He has had his dinner, Aunt Fanny, and his medicine, and I promise you that nothing will prevent your seeing him later in the evening. Aunt Fanny, sit down at once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was not brought up to take orders, Orianna, but I suppose you are mistress here now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed I am. Essex.&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran turned easily in her chair and leaned her head back comfortably. &#x201c;I want to hear how you wasted your youth. Only the scandalous parts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The path gets straighter and narrower all the time,&#x201d; Essex said. &#x201c;The years press in. The path becomes a knife edge and I creep along, holding on even to that, the years closing in on either side and overhead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not very scandalous,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said.</p><p>&#x201c;I am afraid,&#x201d; Aunt Fanny said, &#x201c;that this young man did not have what we used to call &#x2018;advantages&#x2019;. Not everyone, Orianna, was fortunate enough to grow up in luxury and plenty. As of course <i>you</i> know perfectly well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The statistics scratch at your eyes,&#x201d; Essex said. &#x201c;When I was twenty, and could not see time at all, the chances of my dying of heart disease were one in a hundred and twelve. When I was twenty-five and deluded for the first time by a misguided passion, the chances of my dying of cancer were one in seventy-eight. When I was thirty, and the days and hours began to close in, the chances of my dying in an accident were one in fifty-three. Now I am thirty-two years old, and the path getting narrower all the time, and the chances of my dying of anything at all are one in one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very profound,&#x201d; said Mrs. Halloran, &#x201c;but still not altogether scandalous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Ogilvie,&#x201d; said Essex, &#x201c;treasures in an ebony box stolen from the music room and hidden under the handkerchiefs in the top right hand drawer of her dresser the small notes Richard Halloran wrote her four years ago, before, although it is perhaps rude to mention it, he took to his wheel chair. He left one every evening for her, under the big blue cloisonn� vase in the main hall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good heavens,&#x201d; said Miss Ogilvie, pale. &#x201c;<i>That</i> could not be what she means by scandal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do not trouble yourself, Miss Ogilvie,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said, amused. &#x201c;In his capacity as librarian Essex has become accustomed to spying on all of you. He brings me very entertaining stories, and his information is always accurate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A moment of truth,&#x201d; said Aunt Fanny tightly. &#x201c;Coarse and vulgar I said <i>then</i>, and coarse and vulgar I say <i>now</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would not have stayed on&#x2014;&#x201d; Miss Ogilvie began with difficulty.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you would have stayed on. Nothing could have dislodged you; your mistake,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said kindly, &#x201c;was in supposing you could dislodge <i>me</i>. Aunt Fanny&#x2019;s mistake, in a word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is needless and disgusting,&#x201d; Aunt Fanny said. &#x201c;Orianna, if I might have your gracious permission to retire?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stay and finish your wine, Aunt Fanny, and Essex will think of more scandalous stories for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The path gets narrower all the time,&#x201d; Essex said, grinning. &#x201c;Does Aunt Fanny remember the evening when she drank Lionel&#x2019;s birthday champagne and asked me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe I am going to be ill,&#x201d; Aunt Fanny said.</p><p>&#x201c;You have my gracious permission,&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran said. &#x201c;Essex, I am not pleased. <i>You</i> must be above suspicion, even if Aunt Fanny is not. Fanny, if you <i>are</i> going to make some demonstration, please get it over with; I want to have my walk before we play backgammon, and my schedule has already been much disturbed today. Miss Ogilvie, have you finished your wine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are going to play backgammon?&#x201d; demanded Aunt Fanny, distracted. &#x201c;Tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is <i>my</i> house now, Aunt Fanny, as you have reminded me. I see no reason why I should not play backgammon in it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coarse is coarse,&#x201d; Aunt Fanny said. &#x201c;This is a house of mourning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am sure that Lionel would have foregone dying, Aunt Fanny, if he thought his funeral would interfere with my backgammon. Miss Ogilvie, <i>have</i> you finished your wine now?&#x201d; Mrs. Halloran rose. &#x201c;Essex?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>_____</p><p>The character of the house is perhaps of interest. It stood upon a small rise in ground, and all the land it surveyed belonged to the Halloran family. The Halloran land was distinguished from the rest of the world by a stone wall, which went completely around the estate, so that all inside the wall was Halloran, all outside was not. The first Mr. Halloran, father to Richard and Aunt Fanny&#x2014;Frances Halloran she was then&#x2014;was a man who, in the astonishment of finding himself suddenly extremely wealthy, could think of nothing better to do with his money than set up his own world. His belief about the house, only very dimly conveyed to the architect, the decorators, the carpenters and landscapers and masons and hodcarriers who put it together, was that it should contain everything. The other world, the one the Hallorans were leaving behind, was to be plundered ruthlessly for objects of beauty to go in and around Mr. Halloran&#x2019;s house; infinite were the delights to be prepared for its inhabitants. The house must be endlessly decorated and adorned, the grounds constructed and tended with exquisite care. There were to be swans on the ornamental lake before the house, and a pagoda somewhere, and a maze and a rose garden. The walls of the house were to be painted in soft colors with scenes of nymphs and satyrs sporting among flowers and trees. There was to be a great deal of silver, a great deal of gold, much in the way of enamel and mother-of-pearl. Mr. Halloran did not care much for pictures, but conceded a certain few to the decorator; he did, however, insist upon one picture of himself&#x2014;he was a practical and a vain man&#x2014;to be hung over the mantel of the ro...</p></p><h2>Managerial Economics (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>Discover how to use managerial economics to both diagnose and solve business problems with this breakthrough text, designed specifically for MBA students.

The latest economic updates keep you abreast of the most recent economic developments and current economic challenges worldwide. You learn how to apply economic theory to even the most formidable business challenges.</p><p>Dr. Froeb received his undergraduate degree from Stanford University and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. When the antitrust agencies began using his models to predict the competitive effects of mergers, his academic research passed what he calls "a market test." This resulted in his 2003 appointment to Chief Economist of the Federal Trade Commission, where he enforced the antitrust and consumer protection laws of the United States. He also managed 75 economists who tore down barriers to competition (often erected by well-meaning bureaucrats). In July 2005 Dr. Froeb returned to Vanderbilt University where today he holds the William Oehmig Chair of Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise. He used to win the "Most Outstanding Teacher" award, but now he finishes behind his co-author, Brian McCann. His text, MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS: A PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH is well recognized for teaching students to apply economics to real business problems. It is filled with real world problems (and solutions) from Dr. Froeb's students and clients. Dr. Froeb's research focuses on the economics of competition policy. He has taught at Tulane University, worked at the U.S. Department of Justice, and spent a year at the University of Chicago Law School.<br><br>Dr. Brian T. McCann has taught courses in managerial economics, strategic management, and entrepreneurship at the undergraduate, MBA and executive education levels. He holds an MBA from Vanderbilt University, where he earned the Founder's Medal as the top graduate of his class. Dr. McCann received his doctoral training in strategic management at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management, where he was awarded the Ross Fellowship, the Krannert Certificate for Distinguished Teaching, and the Purdue Research Foundation Research Grant. His more than 10 years of industry experience include operating a residential land development company, serving as the CFO for an Internet start-up, and implementing new strategic initiatives for a non-profit economic development group. In addition to co-authoring this MBA-level textbook in managerial economics, Dr. McCann's work has appeared or is forthcoming in journals, such as Strategic Management Journal, Journal of Management, and Journal of Management Studies. His current research interests span strategic management and entrepreneurship and include the performance implications of firm agglomeration, the effects of ownership structure on competitive behaviors, and the role of threshold-based decision making in the entrepreneurial process.<br><br>Dr. Mike Ward has taught courses in Managerial Economics, Industrial Organization and Business Strategy, Human Resource Economics, and Economics and Regulation of Information. He has spent nearly two decades in academia, holding positions at the University of Illinois and the University of Texas at Arlington where he is currently Professor of Economics in the Business School.

The spirited daughter of Bohemian immigrants, �ntonia must adapt to a hard existence on the desolate prairies of the Midwest. Enduring childhood poverty, teenage seduction, and family tragedy, she eventually becomes a wife and mother on a Nebraska farm. A fictional record of how women helped forge the communities that formed a nation, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RMy �ntonia&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is also a hauntingly eloquent celebration of the strength, courage, and spirit of America&#x2019;s early pioneers.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RGordon Tapper&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R is Assistant Professor of English at DePauw University.

First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Early Retirement Extreme shows how I did it and how anyone can formulate their own plan for financial independence. The book provides the principles and framework for a systems theoretical strategy for attaining that independence in 5-10 years. It teaches how a shift in focus from consuming to producing can help people out of the consumer trap, and offers a path to achieving the freedom necessary to pursue interests other than working for a living. The principles in Early Retirement Extreme show how to break the financial chains that hold people back from doing what they truly want to do. The framework has been used by many people over the last few years to accomplish a variety of goals. It provides people a means to achieve almost any goal, whether it&#x2019;s debt-free living, extended travel, a sabbatical, a career change, time off to raise a child, a traditional retirement, or simply a desire for a more resilient and self-sufficient lifestyle. The book was initially written for people in their 20s and 30s, but its ideas aren&#x2019;t limited to early retirees. Middle-aged people in the grips of consumerism can use the principles to take back control of their lives. People closer to retirement age who don&#x2019;t feel adequately prepared can use it to set themselves up for a comfortable retirement in a relatively short period of time. Anyone worried about their financial future can use the principles in Early Retirement Extreme to make their future more secure.</p><p>Jacob Lund Fisker retired at 33 and wrote Early Retirement Extreme to share his systems-theory approach to personal economic efficiency with others. His ideas have been featured in articles in Forbes, CNBC, USA Today, US News &amp; World Report, The Guardian, PBS Next Avenue, The Atlantic, and many others.</p><h2>Crisis and Trauma: Developmental-Ecological Intervention (Crisis Intervention)</h2><p>This text introduces students to the fundamental concepts of crisis theory and practice, and provides models for single-session intervention and ongoing crisis counseling.

It keeps the focus of the discussion on the object, its manufacture, and its visual character. It considers the contribution of the artist as an important part of the analysis. This edition maintains an organization along the lines established by Janson, with separate chapters on the Northern European Renaissance, the Italian Renaissance, the High Renaissance, and Baroque art, with stylistic divisions for key periods of the modern era. Also embedded in this edition is the narrative of how art has changed over time in the cultures that Europe has claimed as its patrimony.</p></p><p><p><i>R<i>ewritten</i></i><i>and reorganized, this&nbsp;new edition weaves together the most recent scholarship, the most current thinking in art history, and the most innovative online supplements, including digital art library.<strong>Experience the new Janson and re-experience the history of art</strong>.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Long established as the classic and seminal introduction to art of the Western world, the&nbsp;Eighth Edition of<i>Janson's History of Art</i>is groundbreaking.

It <i>contains</i> many things: poems; confessional reveries; disquisitions on the proper way to listen to Beethoven; snippets of dialogue, both real and imagined; a lengthy response to a survey from the <i>Partisan Review</i>; exhaustive catalogs of furniture, clothing, objects, and smells. And then there are Walker Evans's famously stark portraits of depression-era sharecroppers--photographs that both stand apart from and reinforce James Agee's words. <p> Assigned to do a story for <i>Fortune</i> magazine about sharecroppers in the Deep South, Agee and Evans spent four weeks living with a poor white tenant family, winning the Burroughs's trust and immersing themselves in a sharecropper's daily existence. Given a first draft of the resulting article, the editors at <i>Fortune</i> quite understandably threw up their hands--as did several other editors who subsequently worked with a later book-length manuscript. The writing was contrary. It refused to accommodate itself to the reader, and at times it positively bristled with hostility. (What other book could take Marx as the epigraph and then announce: "These words are quoted here to mislead those who will be misled by them"?) Response to the book was puzzled or unfriendly, and <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> sputtered out of print only a few short years after its publication. It took the 1960s, and a vogue for social justice, to bring Agee's masterwork the audience it deserved.</p><p> Yet the book is far more interesting--aesthetically and morally--than the sort of guilty-liberal tract for which it is often mistaken. On an existential level, Agee's text is a deeply felt examination of what it means to suffer, to struggle to live in spite of suffering. On a personal level, it is the painful, beautifully written portrait of one man's obsession. In its collaboration with Evans's photographs, the book is also a groundbreaking experiment in form. In the end, however, it is more than merely the sum of its parts. <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> is, quite simply, a book unlike any other, simmering with anger and beauty and mystery. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>James Agee (1909-1955) was a poet, screenwriter, and journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.</p><h2>Holt McDougal Algebra 1, Teacher&#39;s Edition 2012</h2><p>2012 copyright hardcover teacher&#39;s edition</p><p></p><h2>Understanding Perennials: A New Look at an Old Favorite (Frances Tenenbaum Books)</h2><p>Perennials are the basis of virtually every garden.

Schulman takes us back to her Lower East Side and brings it to life, filling these pages with vivid memories of her avant-garde queer friends and dramatically recreating the early years of the AIDS crisis as experienced by a political insider. Interweaving personal reminiscence with cogent analysis, Schulman details her experience as a witness to the loss of a generation&#x2019;s imagination and the consequences of that loss.</p><p>"Sarah Schulman, as always, hits the nail on the head.

There are still witches who whisper upon tied knots to curse or heal, sorceresses who shapeshift into animals or household objects, magicians who cast spells for love or good fortune, and common folk who seek their aid for daily problems big and small. <br><br>Sharing the extensive knowledge she inherited from her mother and grandmother, including spells of the &#x201c;Old Believers&#x201d; previously unknown to outsiders, Natasha Helvin explores in detail the folk history and practice of Russian sorcery and Eastern Slavic magical rites, offering a rich compendium of more than 300 spells, incantations, charms, and practical rituals for love, relationships, career success, protection, healing, divination, averting the evil eye, communicating with spirits and ancestors, and a host of other life challenges and daily situations, with complete step-by-step instructions to ensure your magical goals are realized. She explains how this tradition has only a thin Christian veneer over its pagan origins and how the Slavic pagan gods and goddesses acquired new lives as the saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church. She details how the magical energy for these spells and rituals is drawn from the forces of nature, revealing specific places of power in the natural world as well as the profound power of graveyards and churches for casting spells. She explores the creation of amulets and talismans, the importance of icons, and the proper recital of magical language and actions during spells, as well as how one becomes a witch or sorceress. <br><br>Offering a close examination of these two-thousand-year-old occult practices, Helvin also includes Slavic folk advice, adapted for the modern era. Revealing what it means to be a Slavic witch or sorceress, and how this vocation pervades all aspects of life, she shows that each of us has magic within that we can use to take control of our own destiny.</p><p>Born in the Soviet Union, Natasha Helvin is an occultist, hereditary witch, and priestess in the Haitian Vodou tradition, as well as an avid scholar of other magical traditions. She learned the ancient Slavic secrets of magic and healing from her family and, as a child, often saw her grandmother and mother use magic in their everyday lives to help neighbors and friends. A professional rootworker and spiritual coach, she lives in the Pacific Northwest.<b>Chapter 1. Pagan Christianity, or Christian Paganism</b><br><br>Even before the Orthodox Christian faith made its appearance, whole provinces that refused to recognize the new gods appeared. They didn&#x2019;t want to betray the faith of their homeland and their grandfathers. Mysticism played a huge role in their lives. The Old Believers&#x2019; faith was bound tightly to their magic and rituals. The majority of spells that originate in that Slavic period come to us from the era of the Old pagan gods. The great Slavic magic that drew its power from nature was born in this period.<br><br>This power stemmed from Earth, the mother and protector. It gave us food, clothes, and the ability to sow and harvest crops. It also came from Water, without which there would be no crops. Then there is Air, which is no less essential than Water, and Fire, which gives us warmth, light, and protection from wild animals. With Fire, it was possible not only to cook food and warm your home, but also to make weapons. By then, Slavs had already mastered metal. <br><br>These four elements represented pure nature for all Old Believers. It was nature that fortified their magic and combined the strength of all the elements at once. The rites of the Old Believers formed the basis of today&#x2019;s elemental and natural magic.<br><br>Magic was an important part of calendar rituals related to household, agriculture, and family life, including birth, marriage, and death. Rituals often included acts such as submerging something in water, jumping over fire, and using fur coats to symbolize wealth. The most common form of mind-driven magic was sorcery. Sorceresses were considered capable of depriving the cow of milk, spoiling crops, and causing illness and even death to individuals, but also charming young people, protecting people from disease and defending against the incantations of other sorceresses. <br><br><b>Chapter 2. Spells</b> <br><br>Spells and incantations are a concept familiar to us from childhood. A spell is a sequence of words with a certain rhythm and order that gives them a particular sound, made to achieve any purpose. A sorcerer uses a spell to accomplish the desired effect. It doesn&#x2019;t matter what language the words are in, as this does not diminish the effectiveness of the action and in some cases even increases it. The spell is usually composed in a poetic format. Spells come in different styles and sizes, but their crucial feature is the rhythm used to say them. This rhythm helps a sorcerer enter into a kind of trance and complete the planned rite. Spells can apply to various spheres: love, finances, influencing a person or nature, addressing the dweller of another world.<br><br>The spell will not work by itself. It is impossible to just say the words aloud and get the desired effect. Correct spells steer the power of the sorcerer in the right direction, as they&#x2019;re one of the tools of trade, but directing the energy on the desired route is still rather complicated. Along with spells, more experienced sorcerers often use additional auxiliary materials such as plants, stones, knives, candles, and much more.<br><br>The vibrations that occur when saying words with a certain rhythm and directed intention can perform genuine miracles. The areas in which people use spells are very different, from household magic to healing. <br><br>As you read a spell, the algorithm of magic acts in the most direct way, affecting nature and men. Ancient spells work regardless of whether you believe in them or not. Words that are part of a spell can often be incomprehensible to a modern person, but they shouldn&#x2019;t be replaced, as the result of your work depends on it.<br><br>Spells range from very simple to quite elaborate and difficult to pronounce, such as the ones meant for solving fairly complex problems. <br><br>You can charm water for health, and it will take minimal time and energy, but you cannot just say the text aloud with an image in your mind and expect an instant change from negative to positive. You will need a whole set of measures and a built-in work pattern.<br><br>Spell needs to be read and spoken by heart, melodiously, aloud or in a low voice, with mental focus on the result. As you work with spells, you must demonstrate your sincerity and faith. You should have no doubts about what you do; you haven&#x2019;t resorted to such means for help lightly. You must know that it will work and affect your situation as you want it to. <br><br><b>Love/Binding spell</b> <br><br>Purchase a bottle of good red wine in the store. Do not take change. If this is not possible, drop the change at the shop&#x2019;s doorstep. Go home. Close the doors and windows, and make sure that nobody will bother you. Calm down, relax, and sit in the center of the room. Take the bottle in both hands, and hold it up so while you read the spell, your breath touches it. Close your eyes, picture before you the image of your beloved, and speak these words for about ten minutes: <br><br><i>&#x201c;As I speak I spell this wine,<br>(The name of the chosen one)&#x2019;s passion to be mine;<br>His thoughts and feelings, submit to me. <br>As soon as he sips this wine, <br>His love eternal will be mine.&#x201d; <br></i><br>You need to put in your maximum of emotions and feelings (energy). <br><br>Now wrap the bottle in a clean white towel and lay it under your bed. It must stay there for three nights. During this time, the energy of your desire will fully enter the drink. Then within 24 hours you need to treat this wine to your lover. To avoid suspicion, think of an occasion in advance. <br><br>When the man takes the first sip, repeat inwardly words of the spell, once is enough, while looking into his eyes.</p><h2>Prentice Hall Science Explorer: Earth&#39;s Waters</h2><p>Prentice Hall Science Explorer 2007 Earth&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Water Student Edition Lead author Michael Padilla once again sets the standard for engaging, hands-on science exploration.

As always during these dreadful nights, the clock seems to tick faster as the final hour approaches. I&#x2019;ve suffered through two of these countdowns in other states. One went full cycle and my man uttered his final words. The other was waved off in a miracle finish.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tick away&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not going to happen, not tonight anyway. The folks who run Alabama may one day succeed in serving Duke his last meal before sticking a needle in his arm, but not tonight. He&#x2019;s been on death row for only nine years. The average in this state is fifteen. Twenty is not unusual. There is an appeal bouncing around somewhere in the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta, and when it lands on the desk of the right law clerk within the hour this execution will be stayed. Duke will return to the horrors of solitary confinement and live to die another day.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He&#x2019;s been my client for the past four years. His team includes a mammoth firm in Chicago, which has committed thousands&nbsp;of pro bono hours, and an anti-death penalty group out of Birmingham that is spread pretty thin. Four years ago, when I became convinced he was innocent, I signed on as the point man. Currently I have five cases, all wrongful convictions, at least in my opinion. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#x2019;ve watched one of my clients die. I still believe he was innocent. I just couldn&#x2019;t prove it in time. One is enough.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the third time today, I enter Alabama&#x2019;s death row and stop at the metal detector blocking the front door where two frowning guards are protecting their turf. One holds a clipboard and stares at me as if he&#x2019;s forgotten my name since my last visit two hours ago.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Post, Cullen Post,&#x201d; I say to the dunce. &#x201c;For Duke Russell.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He scans his clipboard as if it holds vital information, finds what he wants, and nods to a plastic basket on a short conveyor belt. In it, I place my briefcase and cell phone, same as before. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Watch and belt?&#x201d; I ask like a real smart-ass.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he grunts with an effort. I step through the detector, get cleared, and once again an innocence lawyer manages to properly enter death row without weaponry. I grab my briefcase and cell phone and follow the other guard down a sterile hallway to a wall of bars. He nods, switches click and clang, the bars slide open, and we hike down another hallway, trudging deeper into this miserable building. Around a corner, some men are waiting outside a windowless steel door. Four are in uniform, two in suits. One of the latter is the warden.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looks gravely at me and steps over. &#x201c;Got a minute?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not many,&#x201d; I reply. We move away from the group for a private chat. He&#x2019;s not a bad guy, just doing his job, which he&#x2019;s new at and thus he&#x2019;s never pulled off an execution. He&#x2019;s also the enemy, and whatever he wants he will not get from me. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We huddle up like pals and he whispers, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it look like?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glance around as if to evaluate the situation and say, &#x201c;Gee, I don&#x2019;t know. Looks like an execution to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on, Post. Our lawyers are saying it&#x2019;s a go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Your lawyers are idiots. We&#x2019;ve already had this conversation.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on, Post. What are the odds right now?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fifty-fifty,&#x201d; I say, lying.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This puzzles him and he&#x2019;s not sure how to respond. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see my client,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he says louder as if frustrated. He can&#x2019;t be viewed as cooperating with me, so he storms off. The guards step back as one of them opens the door.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inside the Death Room, Duke is lying on a cot with his eyes closed. For the festivities, the rules allow him a small color television so he can watch whatever he wants. It&#x2019;s on mute with cable news giddy over wildfires out west. His countdown is not a big story on the national front.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At execution time, every death state has its own silly rituals, all designed to create as much drama as possible. Here, they allow full-contact visits with close family members in a large visitation room. At 10:00 p.m., they move the condemned man to the Death Room, which is next door to the Death Chamber where he&#x2019;ll be killed. A chaplain and a lawyer are permitted to sit with him, but no one else. His last meal is served around 10:30, and he can order whatever he wants, except for alcohol.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How you doing?&#x201d; I ask as he sits up and smiles. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Never felt better. Any news?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not yet, but I&#x2019;m still optimistic. We should hear something soon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke is thirty-eight and white, and before getting arrested&nbsp;for rape and murder his criminal record consisted of two DUIs and a bunch of speeding tickets. No violence whatsoever. He was a party boy and hell-raiser in his younger days, but after nine years in solitary he has settled down considerably. My job is to set him free, which, at the moment, seems like a crazy dream. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I take the remote and change channels to one from Birmingham, but I leave it on mute.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You seem awfully confident,&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can afford to. I&#x2019;m not getting the needle.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a funny man, Post.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Relax, Duke.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Relax?&#x201d; He swings his feet to the floor and smiles again. He does indeed look rather relaxed, given the circumstances. He laughs and says, &#x201c;Do you remember Lucky Skelton?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They finally got him, about five years ago, but not before serving him three last meals. Three times he walked the gangplank before getting the shove. Sausage pizza and a cherry Coke.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And what did you order?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Steak and fries, with a six-pack of beer.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t count on the beer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Are you gonna get me outta here, Post?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not tonight, but I&#x2019;m working on it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;If I get out I&#x2019;m going straight to a bar and drinking cold beer until I pass out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with you. Here&#x2019;s the Governor.&#x201d; He appears on-screen and I hit the volume.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He&#x2019;s standing in front of a bank of microphones with camera lights glaring at him. Dark suit, paisley tie, white shirt, every tinted hair gelled with precision. A walking campaign ad. Sufficiently burdened, he says, &#x201c;I have thoroughly reviewed Mr. Russell&#x2019;s case and discussed it at length with my investigators. I&#x2019;ve also met with the family of Emily Broone, the victim of Mr. Russell&#x2019;s crimes, and the family is very much opposed to the idea of clemency. After considering all aspects of this case, I have decided to allow his conviction to stand. The court order will remain in place, and the execution will go forward. The people have spoken. Clemency for Mr. Russell is therefore denied.&#x201d; He announces this with as much drama as he can muster, then bows and slowly backs away from the cameras, his grand performance complete. Elvis has left the building. Three days ago, he found the time to grant me an audience for fifteen minutes, after which he discussed our &#x201c;private&#x201d; meeting with his favorite reporters. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If his review had been so thorough, he would know that Duke Russell had nothing to do with the rape and murder of Emily Broone eleven years ago. I hit the mute again and say, &#x201c;No surprise there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Has he ever granted clemency?&#x201d; Duke asks. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a loud knock on the door and it swings open. Two guards enter and one is pushing a cart with the last meal. They leave it and disappear. Duke stares at the steak and fries and a rather slim slice of chocolate cake, and says, &#x201c;No beer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Enjoy your iced tea.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sits on the cot and begins to eat. The food smells deli- cious and it hits me that I have not eaten in at least twenty-four hours. &#x201c;Want some fries?&#x201d; he asks.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t eat all this. For some reason I don&#x2019;t have much of an appetite.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How was your mom?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stuffs in a large chunk of steak and chews slowly. &#x201c;Not too good, as you might expect. A lot of tears. It was pretty awful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cell phone in my pocket vibrates and I grab it. I look at the caller ID and say, &#x201c;Here it is.&#x201d; I smile at Duke and say hello. It&#x2019;s the law clerk at the Eleventh Circuit, a guy I know pretty well, and he informs me that his boss has just signed an order staying the execution on the grounds that more time is needed to determine whether Duke Russell received a fair trial. I ask him when the stay will be announced and he says immediately.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I look at my client and say, &#x201c;You got a stay. No needle tonight. How long will it take to finish that steak?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Five minutes,&#x201d; he says with a wide smile as he carves more beef.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can you give me ten minutes?&#x201d; I ask the clerk. &#x201c;My client would like to finish his last meal.&#x201d; We go back and forth and finally agree on seven minutes. I thank him, end the call, and punch another number. &#x201c;Eat fast,&#x201d; I say. He has suddenly found his appetite and is as happy as a pig at the trough.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The architect of Duke&#x2019;s wrongful conviction is a small-town prosecutor named Chad Falwright. Right now he&#x2019;s waiting in the prison&#x2019;s administration building half a mile away, poised for the proudest moment of his career. He thinks that at 11:30 he&#x2019;ll be escorted to a prison van, along with the Broone family and the local sheriff, and driven here to death row where they&#x2019;ll be led to a small room with a large glass window that&#x2019;s covered with a curtain. Once situated there, Chad thinks, they&#x2019;ll wait for the moment when Duke is strapped to the gurney with needles in his arms and the curtain will be pulled back in dramatic fashion.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a prosecutor, there is no greater sense of accomplishment than to witness an execution for which he is responsible. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chad, though, will be denied the thrill. I punch his number and he answers quickly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Post,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Over here on death row with some bad news. The Eleventh Circuit just issued a stay. Looks like you&#x2019;ll crawl back to Verona with your tail between your legs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stutters and manages to say, &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You heard me, Chad. Your bogus conviction is unraveling and this is as close as you&#x2019;ll ever get to Duke&#x2019;s scalp, which, I must say, is pretty damned close. The Eleventh Circuit has doubts about the trivial notion of a fair trial, so they&#x2019;re sending it back. It&#x2019;s over, Chad. Sorry to ruin your big moment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is this a joke, Post?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh sure. Nothing but laughs over here on death row. You&#x2019;ve had fun talking to the reporters all day, now have some fun with this.&#x201d; To say I loathe this guy would be a tremendous understatement.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I end the call and look at Duke, who&#x2019;s feasting away. With his mouth full he asks, &#x201c;Can you call my mother?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No. Only lawyers can use cell phones in here, but she&#x2019;ll know soon enough. Hurry up.&#x201d; He washes it down with tea and attacks the chocolate cake. I take the remote and turn up the volume. As he scrapes his plate, a breathless reporter appears somewhere on the prison grounds and, stuttering, tells us that a stay has been granted. He looks bewildered and confused, and there is confusion all around him.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within seconds there is a knock on the door and the warden enters. He sees the television and says, &#x201c;So I guess you&#x2019;ve heard?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Right, Warden, sorry to ruin the party. Tell your boys to stand down and please call the van for me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke wipes his mouth with a sleeve, starts laughing and says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look so disappointed, Warden.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, actually I&#x2019;m relieved,&#x201d; he says, but the truth is obvious. He, too, has spent the day talking to reporters and savoring the spotlight. Suddenly, though, his exciting broken-field run has ended with a fumble at the goal line.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m out of here,&#x201d; I say as I shake Duke&#x2019;s hand. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Thanks Post,&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch.&#x201d; I head for the door and say to the warden, &#x201c;Please give my regards to the Governor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#x2019;m escorted outside the building where the cool air hits hard and feels exhilarating. A guard leads me to an unmarked prison van a few feet away. I get in and he closes the door. &#x201c;The front gate,&#x201d; I say to the driver.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I ride through the sprawl of Holman Correctional Facility, I am hit with fatigue and hunger. And relief. I close my eyes, breathe deeply, and absorb the miracle that Duke will live to see another day. I&#x2019;ve saved his life for now. Securing his freedom will take another miracle.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For reasons known only to the people who run this place, it has been on lockdown for the past five hours, as if angry inmates might organize into a Bastille-like mob and storm death row to rescue Duke. Now the lockdown is subsiding; the excitement is over. The extra manpower brought in to maintain order is withdrawing, and all I want is to get out of here. I&#x2019;m parked in a small lot near the front gate, where the TV crews are unplugging and going home. I thank the driver, get in my little Ford SUV, and leave in a hurry. Two miles down the highway I stop at a closed country store to make a call.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His name is Mark Carter. White male, age thirty-three, lives in a small rental house in the town of Bayliss, ten miles from Verona. In my files I have photos of his house and truck and&nbsp;current live-in girlfriend. Eleven years ago, Carter raped and murdered Emily Broone, and now all I have to do is prove it. Using a burner, I call the number of his cell phone, a number I&#x2019;m not supposed to have. After five rings he says, &#x201c;Hello.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is this Mark Carter?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Who wants to know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know me, Carter, but I&#x2019;m calling from the prison. Duke Russell just got a stay, so I&#x2019;m sorry to inform you that the case is still alive. Are you watching television?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of American Literature (Shorter Seventh Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>Firmly grounded in the core strengths that have made it the best-selling undergraduate survey in the field, <em>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</em> has been revitalized in this Seventh Edition through the collaboration between three new period editors and five seasoned ones.</strong></p> Under Nina Baym's direction, the editors have considered afresh each selection and the entire apparatus to make the Shorter Edition an even better teaching tool for the one-semester and brief two-semester courses.<br></p><p><p><strong>Nina Baym</strong> (Ph.D. Harvard) is Swanlund Endowed Chair and Center for Advanced Study Professor Emerita of English and Jubilee Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

However, much has changed on campuses. The explosion of technology, ubiquity of social media, and culture changes have all added new layers of complexity to the leap from high school to college. THE FRESHMAN SURVIVAL GUIDE's updated edition features new research and advice on issues such as mental health, sexual assault, and finding balance. It also features expanded sections on dating, money management, and an increased focus on how the over 1.5 million incoming freshman can prepare themselves for the biggest change they've encountered in their lives: heading off to college.</p><p>NORA BRADBURY-HAEHL is a writer for teens and 20-somethings and a twenty-year veteran of youth ministry.

From healthy relationship building to avoiding the disastrous pull of procrastination, the guide colorfully dispenses common sense and holistic development. The newest members of any college community will find in this guide a wonderful blend of down-to-earth advice and answers to the deepest of life questions. It is not afraid to address the big life questions of faith, service, the meaning of life and one's spiritual journey. I can not think of a better gift to give a son or daughter, a niece or nephew, a godchild or grandchild who is heading off to college.&#x2015;<b><i>Michael Galligan-Stierle, Ph.D., President, Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities</i></b><br><br>Every young person goes to college with a computer-and now they need to go with THE FRESHMAN SURVIVAL GUIDE.&#x2015;<b><i>Bob McCarty, Executive Director, National Federation of Youth Ministry</i></b><br><br>College students arrive on campus with impressive resumes and advanced academic skills.

I have used the examples as a springboard for developing other experiential learning exercises in class. I especially appreciate the chapter addressing multicultural issues in work with couples, as the authors address concerns that are less commonly brought to light.

Paperback. The concept of the absurd and the relationship between the absurd and suicide are the subject of this essay. Once recognized the divorce between the reasonable desire of understanding and happiness and the world of silence, the man he may feel that life is worth living? This is the fundamental question of philosophy. But if the absurd is clear to me, I have to keep a clear effort and accept living the lifestyle. My revolt, my freedom, my passion will be consequences. Insured die entirely, but refusing death, delivered from supernatural hope that bound him, the man will be able to know the passion to live in a world made its indifference and its perishable beauty. Images of Don Juan, the actor, the adventurer illustrate freedom and lucid wisdom of the absurd man. But creation - once admitted that she may not be - is for him the best chance to keep his conscience awakened vibrant images without reason in the world. The labor of Sisyphus who despises the gods, love life and hate death, figure the human condition. But the struggle to the heights carries its reward in itself. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p><p>Albert Camuswas born in Algeria in 1913.

Peggy Levitt explores the powerful familial, religious, and political connections that arise between Miraflores, a town in the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood in Boston and examines the ways in which these ties transform life in both the home and host country.<br><br><i>The Transnational Villagers </i>is one of only a few books based on in-depth fieldwork in the countries of origin and reception. It provides a moving, detailed account of how transnational migration transforms family and work life, challenges migrants' ideas about race and gender, and alters life for those who stay behind as much, if not more, than for those who migrate. It calls into question conventional thinking about immigration by showing that assimilation and transnational lifestyles are not incompatible. In fact, in this era of increasing economic and political globalization, living transnationally may become the rule rather than the exception.</p><p>"<i>The Transnational Villagers</i> is one of the finest empirical studies available of a phenomenon that is commanding the attention of scholars and policymakers--the creation and maintenance of social ties and dual lives across national borders. In this admirable ethnography, Levitt offers a glimpse of what the world of the new century might begin to look like. This book both contributes to the vibrant research literature on international migration, and challenges it."&#x2015;Rub�n G. Rumbaut, co-author of <i>Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Generation</i> <br><br>"Levitt allows her respondents to speak and to tell marvelously incisive stories that reveal the dislocations as well as the new possibilities associated with transnationalism. <i>The Transnational Villagers</i> is a major contribution to our understanding of the meaning of borders in an age when technology increasingly seems to allow humans to leap effortlessly over them."&#x2015;Richard Alba, author of <i>Ethnic Identities</i> <br><br>"Levitt's study makes abundantly clear that immigration is no longer a one-way process, but a complex multi-faceted experience increasingly bringing together places of origin and destination. A must read for anyone interested in immigration and national development."&#x2015;Alejandro Portes, co-author of <i>Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second-Generation</i> <br><br>"In her study of Dominicans living in Boston yet maintaining close connection with family and politics in the Dominican Republic, Levitt asks, do these new transnational communities mean something new for our long established expectation of assimilation to American society and if so, what? She truly breaks new ground in our understanding of immigration and ethnicity today."&#x2015;Nathan Glazer, author of <i>We Are All Multiculturalists Now </i> <br><br>"Levitt provides an empathetic and rich account of village life and the lives of ordinary migrants, but also makes a major original contribution to social scientists' understanding of migration and the diffusion of global culture. Beautifully written, forcefully argued, and theoretically original, this book should be required reading for anyone concerned with immigration, globalization or development studies."&#x2015;Mary Waters, author of <i>Black Identities: West Indian Immigrant Dreams and American Realities</i><b>Peggy Levitt </b>is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Wellesley College and Associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University.</p><h2>Light, Shade and Shadow (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p>During the first half of the twentieth century, E.

As soon as your soul begins its life experience, a field of energy is released that records every thought, word, action, desire, and emotion. In this guide to opening the Akashic Records, Maureen St. Germain provides precise instructions explaining how to connect with your personal Record Keepers, gain clear access to the Akashic Records, discover information about you and your loved ones, and learn your soul&#x2019;s purpose. <br><br>The author explains how outside energies can influence your connection to the Akashic Records. She details energetic clearing exercises to remove the energies blocking or shadowing your access and teaches the Higher Self Protocol to ensure an authentic channel of communication. She explores how to find the Record Keepers who will be the most helpful to you and provides techniques and tools, such as guided energy work, to prepare you for Akashic Record access, initiate you into the 5D mindset, and invite more accuracy and a stronger connection. She details the specific markers to look for to recognize genuine Akashic Librarians and to validate and confirm the information you receive, rather than simply &#x201c;trusting&#x201d; it to be true. She also provides guidance on accessing the Akashic Records on behalf of other people, how to ask questions, and how to handle the information as it comes in. <br><br>Explaining why the Ascended Masters opened access to the Akashic Records to all of humanity and how their presence assists you, St. Germain shows how the intended purpose for working with the Akashic Records is for soul growth, not to &#x201c;repair&#x201d; your karma debts. By seeing your records and working with your Record Keepers, not only will you learn your soul&#x2019;s purpose and help solve the problems that crop up in everyday life and relationships, but you will amplify your spirituality and begin operating at a higher level in consciousness. Your work in the Akashic Records aids and assists in Earth&#x2019;s ascension.</p><p>Maureen J. St. Germain is the founder of Transformational Enterprises and has led trainings in personal development and spiritual awakening in more than 24 countries. The founder of Akashic Records Guides International, she is also the author, musician, and producer of more than 15 guided-meditation CDs. An internationally recognized teacher and intuitive, she is the author of 3 books and lives in San Diego and New York.Chapter 7 <br><br>Directing Traffic: Handling Information That Comes In <br><br><b>Go with What You Get</b> <br><br>Sometimes you are taking difficult questions to the Record Keepers. What will they tell you? When you need a breakthrough on some issue or concern, it is always good to pay attention to the signs and signals that show up along the way. Sometimes you will be attracted to a book. Sometimes you will go somewhere and meet someone who has some service or conversation that you need. When you open the Records, you will be stunned to discover the Record Keepers referring to this new information; they direct you to the book you just purchased or the place you needed to be! <br><br>There will also be times that you will question what the Record Keepers are telling you. If you doubt their information, you can do a quick check-in with your Higher Self. This helps you trust your skills in the Akashic field. Sometimes you might think you are making it up. In fact that is pretty normal. <br><br>Your Record Keepers and Guides can be counted on to help you comprehend more than you can see or understand on your own, thus helping you shift through life&#x2019;s hurdles, harnessing your gifts and magnifying your goodness. <br><br><b>Exercise 7:1. More Questions in the Akashic Records <br></b><br>� Is my ego/mind or emotions blocking me from understanding? <br>� What might be blocking me that needs clearing?<br>� Are there concealed aspects of me that keep me from knowing or understanding the situation? <br><br><b>Unexpected Information</b> <br><br>You may also be surprised that the Record Keepers have solutions for you that you had no idea were possible because they have never occurred to you. When I received an alarming and intuitive, yet subtle, message about my husband&#x2019;s life being in danger at a job site, I asked him if he had checked in with his Higher Self about returning to the location where the fire had occurred (he is a fire scientist). He said, &#x201c;Well, if YOU told me not to go back, I wouldn&#x2019;t return.&#x201d; I filled in the gruesome details and he asked me to open his Akashic Records. I figured he would want to know things such as whether or not it was &#x201c;his time to go&#x201d; or if certain factors could be mitigated. <br><br>He completely took me by surprise by instead asking, &#x201c;What caused the fire?&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been on this investigation for over three months, and I knew no details. Through me, the Record Keepers said, &#x201c;It was to cover up a couple of murders.&#x201d; I was so shocked with this response, that I pulled myself out of the energy of the Akashics, looked at him and said, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s strange, no one died in this fire.&#x201d; Frankly I was really embarrassed, thinking that I had somehow given him false information! He looked at me gravely and said, &#x201c;Actually three people died.&#x201d; It was then I learned that he could find no &#x201c;accidental source&#x201d; for the fire to have occurred, and his pointed question was answered directly in the Records. <br><br>Sometimes you will ask the Record Keepers and Guides something and then not get anything. This usually means there is a block that keeps information from coming through. When this happens, be sure to use the prayer to clear blocks. <br><br><b>Clearing Work<br></b><br>Also be sure to do your clearing work on yourself. Learn how to clear others, especially how to clear remotely. This is very useful when you are working with clients and they need clearing. Many have written about this. I wrote a small concise guide, Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality. Even though you might not think you have any entities or dark energies that might prevent you from connecting with the Akashic Guides or healing yourself--when you do the clearing work, you discover that you suddenly feel better and have the channel open to the Records again.<br><br>There are also other reasons why you might not get good information for a client, or get clarity that you are seeking. You may have lost soul parts that need to be reclaimed and returned to you. People often break off parts of themselves during a traumatic event in order to feel &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; They can be fragmented from situations and occurrences of past life dramas. Soul Retrieval work can help you bring back your damaged and lost parts, gently and easily by you.

What Is the Difference between Wonder and Why? <br></b><br>When you ask your Higher Self, &#x201c;I wonder what&#x2019;s going on&#x201d; or &#x201c;I wonder why that happened,&#x201d; you have opened the window to receiving full information. When you just ask why it is, this is so your ego can compartmentalize the answer. &#x201c;Why&#x201d; questions are to satisfy the ego/mind. &#x201c;Wonder&#x201d; is open-ended, which invites the Record Keepers to provide insight and understanding. <br><br>�What is the meaning of wonder? <br>�What is the meaning of why? <br>�How do I stay in my joy? <br>�What is the most important thing I may learn from a stranger that I met recently? <br>�Pick a fun experience or occurrence that happened this week and ask, &#x201c;What may I know about this event?&#x201d; <br>�Pick an intense/difficult experience or occurrence that happened this week and ask, &#x201c;What may I know about this event?&#x201d;</p><h2>Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction, and Democracy (Oxford Paperbacks)</h2><p>Americans in recent years have become thoroughly disenchanted with our political campaigns, especially with campaign advertising and speeches. Each year, as November approaches, we are bombarded with visceral appeals that bypass substance, that drape candidates in the American flag but tell us nothing about what they'll do if elected, that flood us with images of PT-109 or Willie Horton, while significant issues--such as Kennedy's Addison's Disease or the looming S&amp;L catastrophe--are left unexamined. And the press--the supposed safeguard of democracy--focuses on campaign strategy over campaign substance, leaving us to decide where the truth lies. <br> In <em>Dirty Politics</em>, campaign analyst Kathleen Hall Jamieson provides an eye-opening look at political ads and speeches, showing us how to read, listen to, and watch political campaigns. Jamieson provides a sophisticated (and often humorous) analysis of advertising technique, describing how television ads use soft focus, slow motion, lyrical or patriotic music (Reagan used "I'm Proud to be an American") to place a candidate in a positive light, or quick cuts, black and white, videotape, and ominous music (for instance, the theme from "Jaws") to portray the opposition. She shows how ads sometimes mimic news spots to add authenticity (Edwin Edwards, in his race against David Duke, actually used former NBC correspondent Peter Hackis, who would begin an ad saying "This is Peter Hackis in Baton Rouge"). And Jamieson points out that consultants create inflammatory ads hoping that the major networks will pick them up and run them as news, giving the ad millions of dollars of free air time. The most striking example would be the Willie Horton ad, which the press aired repeatedly (as an example of negative advertising) long after the ad had ceased running. (In fact, it never ran on the major networks as an ad, only as news.) <br> From a colorful, compact history of negative campaigning from Eisenhower to the present, to an in-depth commentary on the Willie Horton ads, to an up-to-the-minute analysis of the Duke-Edwards campaign in Louisiana, <em>Dirty Politics</em> is both a fascinating look at underhanded campaigning as well as a compelling argument for fair, accurate, and substantive campaigns. It is a book that all voters should read before they vote again.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kathleen Hall Jamieson</strong> is Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and is the author of <em>Packaging the Presidency</em>, <em>Eloquence in an Electronic Age</em>, and other books on political discourse.<br>"[Jamieson's] dissection of how drama overcomes data, how vilification and flat assertion replace argument, and how reporters cover strategy instead of substance is methodical and even-handed."--The Christian Science Monitor "Instead of relying upon hearsay and innuendo, Jamieson's book is<br>built upon solid research.

While the world watched the uprising on the Maidan as an episode in geopolitics, those in Ukraine during the extraordinary winter of 2013&#x2013;14 lived the revolution as an existential transformation: the blurring of night and day, the loss of a sense of time, the sudden disappearance of fear, the imperative to make choices.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this lyrical and intimate book, Marci Shore evokes the human face of the Ukrainian Revolution. Grounded in the true stories of activists and soldiers, parents and children, Shore&#x2019;s book blends a narrative of suspenseful choices with a historian&#x2019;s reflections on what revolution is and what it means. She gently sets her portraits of individual revolutionaries against the past as they understand it&#x2014;and the future as they hope to make it. In so doing, she provides a lesson about human solidarity in a world, our world, where the boundary between reality and fiction is ever more effaced.</p><p><b>Marci Shore</b> is associate professor of history at Yale University and award-winning author of <i>Caviar and Ashes</i> and <i>The Taste of Ashes</i>. She has spent much of her adult life in Central and Eastern Europe.<p>&#x201c;[Shore&#x2019;s] history entails an extraordinary declaration of the power of human will and self-determination.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Kate Brown, <i>TLS</i></p><br>&#x201c;<i>The Ukrainian Night</i> . . . seeks to portray the ideals that animated the protesters. Shore succeeds admirably, particularly because she tells the story through their words. . . . Her depictions of the sights, sounds and smells on the Maidan [are] superb."&#x2014;Rajan Menon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"Shore draws evocative portraits of the Ukrainian demonstrators who braved beatings and even death in 2013 to protest the government of President Viktor Yanukovych."&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>, Editors' Choice<br>&#x201c;Ms. Shore identifies the surrealism exemplified in the war as an enduring cultural divide. In the West people tended to believe that &#x2018;there were constraints on reality&#x2019;, whereas &#x2018;eastern Europeans knew that anything was possible&#x2019;. One fear that stalks this short, powerful book is that this distinction is breaking down, and not as the revolutionaries intended&#x2014;that Ukraine, with its saturating propaganda and warped identity politics, might be a vision of the West&#x2019;s future rather than the other way round."&#x2014;<i>The Economist</i><br>"<i>The Ukrainian Night</i> is a must-read for reformers, the diplomatic corps, journalists, and friends of Ukraine&#x2014;if for no other reason than to remember what they sacrificed, what bound strangers together, and how far the country has come. It can also be read as a call for renewal. . . . Shore is a skillful and beautiful writer, and it&#x2019;s impossible to come away from the book without a renewed sense of optimism and hope for Ukraine&#x2019;s future."&#x2014;Melinda Haring, <i>Atlantic Council</i><br>"[Shore] records the simple but searing thoughts and impulses of those who fought or were caught up in the war. . . .

Shore has deep knowledge of the region, its history, and its current torment, and offers a lucid evaluation of the complicated evolution of Eastern Europe, which faces a dangerous situation. Her book is well written and honestly and deeply documented through direct and acute observations of facts on the ground.&#x201d;&#x2014;Norman Manea, Francis Flournoy Professor of European Studies and Writer in Residence, Bard College<br>&#x201c;Shore has the rare capacity to listen to&nbsp;hundreds of voices and turn them into both story and history&#x2014;the finest possible achievement for any writer. In this book, she brings to life the protests and revolution in Ukraine from 2013-2014 by pairing personal anecdotes with political and historical analysis, showing readers how violence can affect one&#x2019;s own friends and acquaintances, inspiring them to start a revolution.&#x201d;&#x2014;Slavenka Drakulic, author of <i>How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed</i><br>&#x201c;The best way to make sense of a revolution unfolding in front of your eyes is to fall in love with it. This is exactly what Marci Shore does in this insightful, moving, and beautifully written reflection on the Ukrainian Maidan."&#x2014;Ivan Krastev, Chairman, Center for Liberal Strategies, Sofia, Bulgaria<br>"Marci Shore, one of the most original American historians today, conjures up the Maidan, the first truly postmodern revolution, with lively scenes and invocations of the layers of a complex past. Her book preserves the memory of this historical moment, which has a unique significance for our political future.&#x201d;&#x2014;Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Albert Gu�rard Professor in Literature, Stanford University<br>&#x201c;This remarkable book gives you a sense of the Euromaidan in Kiev as lived experience, seen through the eyes of a host of very different participants.

Ancient traditions of the pyramid covered in extinct language. A secret body of obscure scriptures in the Bible that refer to the Great Pyramid.

Ancient Egyptian accounts of the discovery of the Great Pyramid, with Egyptian based memories of Abraham visiting the Giza site. Secret traditions regarding the Sphinx and why it appears older than the pyramids &#x2013; but is not.

Baptiste Power Yoga isn't just the ultimate workout, it's the ultimate life transformation program. <br> In this unique and inspiring book, one of the world's most dynamic and sought-after master yoga teachers brings us the same revolutionary program for body, mind, and spirit that has changed the bodies and lives of Hollywood celebrities, all-star athletes, and millions of people just like you. In his refreshing and iconoclastic style, Baron Baptiste shows us that the key to true power is not to chase an ideal version of ourselves but to reveal the perfect self already within. Here are just some of the benefits you can expect from using this book: <br> � Strong, lean muscles and a shedding of unwanted pounds<br> � Laserlike mental clarity and focus<br> � An easy release of the beliefs and habits that hold you back<br> � An inner oasis of calm and composure<br> � Inspiration to live authentically every day of your life <br> Baptiste Power Yoga is the ultimate commitment that yields the ultimate transformation, as Baron's millions of students have discovered. It heals, detoxifies, and electrifies body and mind at their deepest levels. You will find your true strength, your real self, and a new way to live that is both authentic and joyful!</p><p>"Every single one of us is suffering from the same problem," says Baron Baptiste. "We are not living from our authentic selves." <i>Journey into Power</i> offers more than yoga poses; it also aims to "rewire your mind" and "recharge your spiritual batteries." <p> Baptiste's program, based on his weeklong "Journey into Power" boot camps, integrates the physical and spiritual components of yoga. His daily "Power Vinyasa Yoga Practice," done in a heated room, is a challenging series of 54 yoga poses, one flowing into another. The poses are well illustrated and clearly described, including modifications. Baptiste encourages you to reach your edge ("where we come right up against ourselves and what we can do and be") by holding a pose for a breath longer than you think you can or stretching a quarter-inch farther. </p><p> Eight spiritual/psychological principles, described cogently and often lyrically, guide the transformation process. Principle 5, "In Order to Heal You Need to Feel," has this introduction: "The real irony of spiritual growth is that instead of being some miraculous experience, it feels a lot more like going to pieces." </p><p> The rest of the program includes a cleansing diet, daily meditation, and a strong, spiritual focus in daily living. <i>Journey into Power</i> is highly recommended for people ready for a major physical, emotional, and spiritual change. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>Baron Baptiste </b>is the son of two of America's yoga pioneers.

The narratives provide vivid portraits of the land as well as the people and animals that inhabited it, underscoring Roosevelt's abiding concerns as a naturalist.<br><br>Originally published in 1885, <b>Hunting Trips of a Ranchman</b> chronicles Roosevelt's adventures tracking a twelve-hundred-pound grizzly bear in the pine forests of the Bighorn Mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some of the best sections are those in which Roosevelt muses on the beauty of the Bad Lands and the simple pleasures of ranch life.&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Spectator said the book "could claim an honorable place on the same shelf as Walton's <b>Compleat Angler</b>."&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Wilderness Hunter</b>, which came out in 1893, remains perhaps the most detailed account of the grizzly bear ever recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction by Stephen E. Ambrose.</p><p>It's no secret that America's most bully president was also its most bully outdoorsman and conservationist; what's often forgotten was how beautifully and authoritatively he wrote about the wilderness and his considerable experiences there. These two pre-White House narratives--<i>Ranchman</i> was originally published in 1885, <i>Wilderness Hunter</i> eight years later--are rich and vivid. The former chronicles Roosevelt's sojourns in the Dakota Badlands; the latter is an extended love letter to the pleasures and challenges of outdoor life. So what if some of his 19th-century ideas seem politically incorrect by the standards of the next century--magnificent prose is still magnificent prose. "Nowhere, not even at sea," writes the future First Hunter in one haunting passage, "does a man feel more lonely than when riding over the far-reaching seemingly never-ending plains ... [but] after a man has lived a little while on or near them, their very vastness and loneliness and their melancholy monotony have a strong fascination for him." By comparison, the isolation and weight of the Oval Office must have seemed like an afternoon stroll in the park.&#34;Roosevelt&#39;s sojourns in the Dakotas, Montana, and Wyoming had a powerful influence on his outlook and politics. Most of all, his time in the West brought him great joy, a joy that is apparent in every page of Hunting Trips of a Ranchman and The Wilderness Hunter.&#34; --Stephen E. Ambrose</p><h2>The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions: Short Stories)</h2><p>&nbsp;Here are sixteen of the best stories by one of America's most popular storytellers. For nearly a century, the work of O. Henry has delighted readers with its humor, irony and colorful, real-life settings. The writer's own life had more than a touch of color and irony. Born William Sidney Porter in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1862, he worked on a Texas ranch, then as a bank teller in Austin, then as a reporter for the Houston "Post." Adversity struck, however, when he was indicted for embezzlement of bank funds. Porter fled to New Orleans, then to Honduras before he was tried, convicted and imprisoned for the crime in 1898. In prison he began writing stories of Central America and the American Southwest that soon became popular with magazine readers. After his release Porter moved to New York City, where he continued writing stories under the pen name O.<br>HenryThough his work earned him an avid readership, O. Henry died in poverty and oblivion scarcely eight years after his arrival in New York. But in the treasury of stories he left behind are such classics of the genre as "The Gift of the Magi," "The Last Leaf," "The Ransom of Red Chief," "The Voice of the City" and "The Cop and the Anthem" &#x2014; all included in this choice selection. A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.</p><p>Born William Sidney Porter in 1862, O. Henry first lived a checkered life as a cowhand, bank teller, reporter, embezzler, and convict. Then, in a last-minute reversal worthy of one of his own stories, he turned to fiction, and became a celebrated author of ironic miniatures. &#34;The Gift of the Magi&#34; is perhaps his most famous creation. And while this exploration of love and gift-giving doesn&#39;t exactly plumb the depths of human behavior, it does leave us with the final picture of Jim (sans watch) and Della (sans hair, or most of it), which has induced even the crankiest readers to shed a tear since it first appeared in 1906. Get out your handkerchiefs!O. Henry (William Sydney Porter, 1862-1910) was an American short-story writer. In his writing, O. Henry was able to catch the color and movement of the city and showed a genuine sympathy for ordinary people. Some of his works include &#34;Cabbages and Kings&#34;, &#34;Roads of Destiny&#34;, and &#34;Strictly Business&#34; among many others.</p><h2>The Lord of the Rings: Boxed Set</h2><p>All three parts of the epic masterpiece &#39;The Lord of the Rings&#39; in one paperback. Features brand new packaging, the definitive edition of the text, fold-out flaps with the original two-colour maps, and a revised and expanded index. Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power -- the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring -- the ring that rules them all -- which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as the Ring is entrusted to his care. He must leave his home and make a perilous journey across the realms of Middle-earth to the Crack of Doom, deep inside the territories of the Dark Lord. There he must destroy the Ring forever and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose. Since it was first published in 1954, &#39;The Lord of the Rings&#39; has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy has touched the hearts of young and old alike. Now, to coincide with the publication of J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s The Children of Hurin, the definitive 50th Anniversary text, fully restored with almost 400 corrections -- with the full co-operation of Christopher Tolkien -- is reissued with a striking new cover.</p><p>This is a single-volume edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Includes the 50th anniversary fully corrected text setting and an extensive new index"An extraordinary work -- pure excitement." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them <br>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. <br>From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. <br>When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. <br><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. <br>J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <i>The Silmarillion</i>, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was in the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.<br>For information on other books by and about J.R.R.

Calcium supplements, fortified processed food, and pasteurized dairy don't work because the calcium in them doesn't reach our bones. It&#x2019;s a grim picture, but <em>The Healthy Bones Nutrition Plan and Cookbook</em> can help. Coauthors Dr. Laura Kelly and Helen Bryman Kelly, daughter and mother, have a firm grasp on the disciplines concerned with bone health, including nutrient absorption and bone metabolism. They offer readers a natural, effective, and safe approach to conserving bone mass and building healthy bones by creating a personalized nutrition plan that includes eating the right foods in the right combinations.</p> <p>The authors&#x2019; quest for a natural, effective, safe way to prevent and treat bone loss began after 20 years of frustration, during which Helen tried supplements and several popular dietary approaches to arrest bone loss, only to see her bones continue to deteriorate year by year. Drawing on her knowledge of metabolic science and a rigorous examination of current research, Laura created a unique diet-based approach to bone health that allowed Helen&#x2019;s body to absorb the nutrients that are naturally present in whole foods. Helen has been following her personal nutrition plan for four years and has stopped her bone loss completely&#x2015;without taking any pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>Part One of the book begins with a primer on bone metabolism, including the roles of individual vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that can help build strong bones. Building on this knowledge and more, the authors provide a framework and worksheets so readers can use the recipes and work with their doctors to create their personal nutrition plan for skeletal health.</p> <p>The book includes more than 100 bone-health recipes ranging from sauces and small plates to soups, salads, and main dishes, drinks and desserts. The authors also explain how to make staple ingredients such as ghee and bone health vinegar and how to grow shiitake mushrooms&#x2015;an important source of vitamin D. Readers can count on their personal nutrition plans and the Kellys&#x2019; recipes to provide food that helps calcium reach, and potentially strengthen, their bones.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Laura Kelly is a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner and Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

Understanding that we hold the power to reverse and prevent disease, most often through food alone, is the most powerful nugget of wisdom we can hold. Dr. Laura Kelly and her mother, Helen Bryman Kelly, thoroughly explain why osteoporosis is most often due to deficiency, not disease, and how and why to prepare traditional foods for bone health as well as overall gut health. They debunk many of the myths touted in today&#x2019;s food culture and demonstrate how to have an integrated and empowering conversation with your doctor.

From homemade calcium-rich vinegar to fermented probiotic drinks to finding the balance with occasional treats, this book supplies easy-to-make, targeted recipes as well as personal worksheets to map out your plan and track your progress.

Enhanced with over 270 clear, detailed drawings of ships' components, this volume gives the model builder a deep understanding of the workings of a fully rigged and appointed sailing ship. <br>After initial chapters on varying types of ship models, including the built-up model and wooden-sail models, the author devotes individual chapters to the masting of ships, mastheads, the standing rigging, the running rigging, foot-ropes, the blocks, steering wheels, the ship's galley, pumps, ship ironwork, copper sheathing, the ground tackle, gun ports, boats, and davits. He includes as well invaluable tables and lists of data that offer opportunities to compare vital statistics on rigging, masting, and more. <br>Charles G. Davis was a well-known naval architect, shipbuilder, master seaman, racing yachtsman, and nautical chronicler.

I, too, sought to be a chiropractor, for I knew from my observations that this system of carefully examining and adjusting the spinal vertebrae produces results. Painful conditions are alleviated. Sick people get well, the lame walk, and the bent-over are able to again stand erect.</p><p>Upon graduation from chiropractic school, I was anxious to open my office. It wasn&#x2019;t long before I developed a busy practice. But I soon came to see that something was missing in my work. Although most of my colleagues were satisfied with their office practices, I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied. I noticed that the great majority of people who came to my office seemed to be content with the relief I was able to afford them with spinal adjustments, but that many continually came back with the same conditions. I was administering adjustments to their spines, but I discovered that what these people really needed more than anything were adjustments in their ways of living.</p><p>I began to see that people needed to be taught how to improve their lifestyles. Some were in need of mental and spiritual uplifts. Conditions in their lives had pulled them down, driven them to a state of negativity and despair. Some had jobs or careers for which they were physically or mentally ill-suited. Chronic stress and tension had become a way of life for them. Nearly all were in need of adjustments in their diets. Some didn&#x2019;t have time to eat correctly. They were always in a rush. Most, however, had the time to eat incorrectly, consuming foods prepared according to culinary habits passed down in their families. Nearly all lacked the knowledge of what constituted a health-sustaining diet, much less a health-building one. They were prime candidates for an educational adjustment.</p><p>I saw that for a lack of knowing a better way and without the benefit of proper guidance, my patients persisted in the ignorance that promotes chronic ill health. Although I was effecting wonderful relief through chiropractic adjustments, this therapy alone was often not enough to provide long-term changes. Dissatisfied and convinced that neither my patients nor I should continue in this situation, I became determined to make a change.</p><p>I opened my first sanitarium in Altadena, California, in the mountains, a spot considered by city dwellers at the time to be &#x201c;out in the country.&#x201d; It had clean air and lots of sunshine, essential elements for health. There, I could finally monitor my patients and give them the education they needed to make changes in their lives, an education that was impossible to offer in an office practice. It worked, too!</p><p>In subsequent years, I moved to a larger facility. My largest sanitarium was the two-hundred-acre Hidden Valley Ranch in the mountains east of Escondido, California. There, I had everything I needed to help people find the path to health. People from all over the world came to stay for a while to learn the lessons of health, and the sanitarium eventually became quite famous.</p><p>Through the years, many different views of bowel care have been presented, creating some confusion about exactly what constitutes proper bowel hygiene. In this book, I give you the most complete information currently available and the wisdom accumulated over a lifetime devoted to natural therapeutics. This book is offered with the understanding that an individual can learn what is necessary for proper bowel management and to show the results that can be obtained by taking care of the bowel properly. No doctor should be without this knowledge. No doctor should practice any system of healing without first considering the five main elimination channels&#x2014;the bowel, skin, kidneys, lymphatic system, and lungs&#x2014;the most important of which is the bowel.</p><p>The response to the first edition of this book has been wonderful. I have received many suggestions and comments that have prompted me to revise and expand the book to make it more responsive to your needs. I have had many wonderful testimonials from people who successfully applied the lessons of this book!</p><p>The following pages give valuable information about the waste-elimination process, focusing on the bowel in particular. I have always made it a practice to check the main elimination channels on a patient&#x2019;s first visit to my office. Attempting to take care of any symptom in the body without a good elimination system is futile.</p><p>I have traveled to the farthest corners of the earth searching for the secrets to health and long life. I want to share my discoveries with you so that you, too, can partake of the increased well-being and enjoyment of life that can result. This book should awaken you to the realization that the greatest healing power comes from within. To this end, I am offering the insights and wisdom I&#x2019;ve gathered over more than six decades of work in the healing arts and restoration of normal bowel function. In order for you to understand my work, I present a smattering of the anatomy and physiology of the digestive and elimination systems in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, I discuss how digestive malfunction can cause toxins to build up in the intestines, which in turn can make the entire body ill. In Chapter 3, I discuss the bowel disorders that affect so many people that they are today considered common; and in Chapter 4, I explain how a problem in the bowel can cause symptoms in a seemingly unrelated part of the body. The heart and soul of this book are in Chapters 5 and 6, which together present my Ultimate Tissue Cleansing Program. The Seven-Day Cleansing Program, the first phase of the two-part program, is fully explained in Chapter 5; and the Seven-Week Building and Replacement Program, the second of the two phases, is detailed in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, I outline the nutritional sins and dietary laws that form the base of my cleansing program, as well as my dietary and health beliefs in general. And finally, in Chapter 8, I present a few other dietary techniques for bowel management. This last chapter will be of special interest to those persons who wish to cleanse their bowel, but cannot at this point in their lives devote themselves to the full undertaking.</p><p>It often takes an act of resolution and courage to combat the bowel difficulties that so many people experience. There is no better way of resolving these difficulties than by taking positive action. The instructions given in this book will give you the opportunity to take greater responsibility for your level of health and well-being.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>How did I ever become involved with the bowel? The bowel was the last thing I wanted to focus on. It was the last thing that came to my mind. I used to think that when the bowel didn&#x2019;t work well, we should turn to a laxative. I didn&#x2019;t know there was a lifestyle that produces a healthy body. Today, I have found lifestyle to be the most important thing in the world.</p><p>As my attention turned increasingly toward the bowel, I began to look at the deaths of our political leaders and other great people with new eyes. All these people seemed to have complications. Every one of them seemed to have some disorder of the elimination system that contributed to his or her death. Take Frank Sinatra, for example. Mr. Sinatra went to the hospital with the symptoms of a heart attack and ended up with pneumonia. I firmly believe that he would not have come down with pneumonia if he didn&#x2019;t have an undetected bowel problem. The body is a community of many organs working for the good of one another. Without properly functioning elimination organs, the body dies.</p><p>The body is an organization. It digests food, processes oxygen, and undertakes numerous other activities. Every organ contributes something to the body and its activities. As human beings, we need every cell, tissue, and organ that was put into our body. The body is the instrument through which we live, and we should treat it with respect. We cannot take our body, so wonderfully put together, and expect it to function properly if we violate all the natural laws that are necessary for it to be well.</p><p>The first natural law is to feed the body natural food. We are meant to have fiber. We are meant to have natural enzymes. We are meant to have food in its raw state. When we begin to obey the natural laws again, it is almost like re-entering the Garden of Eden.</p><p>When we return to the Garden of Eden, consuming natural foods and following a more natural way of living, the bowel always responds. I&#x2019;ve been told by patients so many times, &#x201c;I am having natural bowel movements for the first time in twenty years.&#x201d; Some patients also tell me, &#x201c;I am even having diarrhea. I am having a bowel movement every day instead of once every ten days.&#x201d; These patients mistake a return to regularity for diarrhea!</p><p>Most people don&#x2019;t understand the bowel. They don&#x2019;t know how to take care of it or how to meet its needs. We go through life violating the natural laws until we reach the point where the most natural thing left is our nutritional program and even that causes abuse to the bowel.</p><p>When the bowel is not taken care of, its responses become sluggish and underactive. It is not able to heal itself and does not have the ability to perform the things it was meant to do.</p><p>Food should pass through the body every eighteen hours. Any food that spoils, ferments, forms gas, or causes a disturbance in the bowel also affects the rest of the body. Above all things, it is necessary to have proper bowel movements in order to have a healthy body.</p><p>I realized early on in my practice that the bowel has to be taken care of. I started seriously caring for the bowel when I realized the good that an enema can do. I saw what a cleansing can do, and I think that I have probably been the most influential voice promoting the cleansing of the bowel. In fact, every patient I have ever treated with bowel cleansing has improved. Note that I did not say &#x201c;was cured.&#x201d; Some did leave their health problems completely behind, but not all did. This is truly something to think about.</p><p>In the 1950s, I spent time with Dr. Max Gerson at his sanitarium in New Jersey. People at the time were crying out for medications in order to get relief from their various disorders. Max, an early proponent of bowel cleansing, said, &#x201c;No, you need an enema, not a drug.&#x201d; Invariably, Max&#x2019;s enemas brought relief. Since he often administered enemas day and night to keep his patients&#x2019; bowels as clean as possible, he had good success even with degenerative conditions. His book, <i>Fifty Cancer Patients Cured</i>, caused a significant stir in the medical community.</p><p>Is it a matter of treating disease? Are we treating the body? No, we are upgrading the ability of the bowel to work better. Are we cleaning out toxic material? Yes, because we have to.</p><p>I have always admired and believed in the work of John Tilden, M.D. Dr. Tilden discovered that toxemia is at the root of most health problems and diseases. (For a full discussion of toxemia, see Chapter 2.) He wrote a book entitled <i>Toxemia Explained</i> that made quite an impact at the time of its publication. Dr. Tilden was widely respected, but his work has since been forgotten and neglected.</p><p>People demand relief from pain and discomfort. Their primary concern is temporary relief, not taking care of the problem at the root of their symptoms. What do we look back to as a cause?</p><p><i>Toxemia Explained</i> is a book that everybody should have. No doctor should practice without it. I didn&#x2019;t always believe the bowel had to be taken care of first. But then I read another book, <i>Pandora&#x2019;s Box: What to Eat and Why</i> by J. Oswald Empringham. This book is about taking care of the bowel.</p><p>I also read with great interest the work of Sir W. Arbuthnot Lane, physician to the British Royal Family in the late nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century. Dr. Lane was a master surgeon. One day, he operated ...</p></p><h2>Coming Through Slaughter</h2><p>Bringing to life the fabulous, colorful panorama of New Orleans in the first flush of the jazz era, this book tells the story of Buddy Bolden, the first of the great trumpet players--some say the originator of jazz--who was, in any case, the genius, the guiding spirit, and the king of that time and place. <br><br>In this fictionalized meditation, Bolden, an unrecorded father of Jazz, remains throughout a tantalizingly ungraspable phantom, the central mysteries of his life, his art, and his madness remaining felt but never quite pinned down. Ondaatje's prose is at times startlingly lyrical, and as he chases Bolden through documents and scenes, the novel partakes of the very best sort of modern detective novel--one where the enigma is never resolved, but allowed to manifest in its fullness. Though more 'experimental' in form than either <i>The English Patient</i> or <i>In the Skin of a Lion</i>, it is a fitting addition to the renowned Ondaatje <i>oeuvre</i>.</p><p>At the turn of the century, the Storyville district of New Orleans had some 2,000 prostitutes, 70 professional gamblers, and 30 piano players. It had only one man who played the cornet like Buddy Bolden. By day he cut hair and purveyed gossip at N. Joseph&#39;s Shaving Parlor. At night he played jazz as though unleashing wild animals in a crowded room. At the age of thirty-one, Buddy Bolden went mad. From these sparse facts Michael Ondaatje has created a haunting, lushly atmospheric novel about one of jazz&#39;s legendary pioneers and martyrs. Obsessed with death, addicted to whiskey, and self-destructively in love with two women, Buddy Bolden embodies all the dire claims that music places on its acolytes. And as told in Coming Through Slaughter, his story is as beautiful and chilling as a New Orleans funeral procession, where even the mourners dance.Michael Ondaatje is the author of three previous novels, a memoir and eleven books of poetry. His novel <b>The English Patient</b> won the Booker Prize.

We cannot go on prostituting the idea of the theater, the only value of which is in its excruciating, magical relation to reality and danger,&#x201d; he wrote. He fought vigorously against an encroaching conventionalism he found anathema to the very concept of theater. He sought to use theater to transcend writing, to break through the language in order to touch life.&#x201d;</p><p>Since its first publication in 1938, <i>The Theater and Its Double</i> by the French artist and philosopher Antonin Artaud has continued to provoke, inspire, enrage, enliven, challenge, and goad any number of theatrical debates in its call for a "Theater of Cruelty." A trio of theatrical manifestos, the book is an aggressive attack on many of the most treasured beliefs of both theater and Western culture. According to Artaud, the theater's "double" is similar to its Jungian "shadow," the unacknowledged, unconscious element that completes it but is in many ways its opposite. As "culture" inexorably draws the artistic impulse into safe channels, the repressed irrational urges of theater, based on dreams, religion, and emotion, are increasingly necessary to "purge" the sickness of society. Artaud identifies language itself as one of the major cultural culprits, and his attacks on it occasionally makes his text rough going. But his challenge to restore relevance to the heart of the theatrical experience remains fundamental to the vitality of theater, and his insistence on the sensory experience of drama as opposed to the literary (and such innovative ideas as the use of unconventional "found spaces") continues to be the clarion call of the theatrical avant-garde. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i>&#39;The Theater and Its Double&#39; is far and away the most important thing that has been written about the theater in the twentieth century. It should be read again and again. Artaud oozed magical desires. He was the metaphysician of the theater.---Jean-Loius Barrault</p><h2>The Light Shall Set You Free</h2><p>The Ascended Masters state this book is destined to transform the world. Contained within these pages are some of the greatest spiritual teachings from the ancient mystery schools, plus instruction on how to apply these teachings to our everyday lives. Some of the information revealed here has not been made available before now. All of the information, if applied to our everyday lives, has the power to revolutionize the world. In the past, only adepts, saints, apostles, mystics, and high priests and priestesses were allowed access to this instruction. With this knowledge, these individuals ruled and empowered themselves and civilizations, using the power that came with this knowledge to create and heal. Common folk leaned heavily on these spiritually elite for solutions to their problems, for the masses had acquired neither the discipline nor the strength of will it took to master the teachings on their own. Learning and applying these truths required lifetimes of discipline and dedication. More importantly, mastering the knowledge demanded that one be accountable for his or her own actions&#x2014;a responsibility the masses were not ready to accept. The Ascended Masters, however, decree that the time has come for everyone to learn these teachings and share in the responsibility for transforming life and the world. Admittance into the Fifth Dimension demands this of all. Therefore, all who read this book must be forewarned that access to this knowledge automatically holds the soul accountable for its part of creation and each will be judged accordingly!

Here is the heart of Stanley's Dark Continent, the country he loved and hated, the scene of his ill-fated expedition to relieve Emin Pasha, an expedition costing hundreds of lives and imposing almost unbearable hardships on the survivors, who trekked across the great forest not once, but three times, losing more lives each time through fighting, sickness and desertion.<br><br>Anyone who has stood in the silent emptiness of a tropical rain forest must know how Stanley and his followers felt, coming as they all did from an open country of rolling plains, of sunlight and warmth. Many people who have visited the Ituri since, and many who have lived there, feel just the same, overpowered by the heaviness of everything -- the damp air, the gigantic water-laden trees that are constantly dripping, never quite drying out between the violent storms that come with monotonous regularity, the very earth itself heavy and cloying after the slightest shower. And, above all, such people feel overpowered by the seeming silence and the age-old remoteness and loneliness of it all.<br><br>But these are the feelings of outsiders, of those who do not belong to the forest. If you <i>are</i> of the forest it is a very different place. What seems to other people to be eternal and depressing gloom becomes a cool, restful, shady world with light filtering lazily through the tree tops that meet high overhead and shut out the direct sunlight -- the sunlight that dries up the non-forest world of the outsiders and makes it hot and dusty and dirty.<br><br>Even the silence is a myth. If you have ears for them, the forest is full of sounds -- exciting, mysterious, mournful, joyful. The shrill trumpeting of an elephant, the sickening cough of a leopard (or the hundred and one sounds that can be mistaken for it), always makes your heart beat a little unevenly, telling you that you are just the slightest bit scared, or even more. At night, in the honey season, you hear a weird, long-drawn-out, soulful cry high up in the trees. It seems to go on and on, and you wonder what kind of creature can cry for so long without taking breath. The people of the forest say it is the chameleon, telling them that there is honey nearby. Scientists will tell you that chameleons are unable to make any such sound. But the forest people of faraway Ceylon also know the song of the chameleon. Then in the early morning comes the pathetic cry of the pigeon, a plaintive cooing that slides from one note down to the next until it dies away in a soft, sad, little moan.<br><br>There are a multitude of sounds, but most of them are as joyful as the brightly colored birds that chase one another through the trees, singing as they go, or the chatter of the handsome black-and-white Colobus monkeys as they leap from branch to branch, watching with curiosity everything that goes on down below. And the most joyful sound of all, to me, is the sound of the voices of the forest people as they sing a lusty chorus of praise to this wonderful world of theirs -- a world that gives them everything they want. This cascade of sound echoes among the giant trees until it seems to come at you from all sides in sheer beauty and truth and goodness, full of the joy of living. But if you are an outsider from the non-forest world, I suppose this glorious song would just be another noise to grate on your nerves.<br><br>The world of the forest is a closed, possessive world, hostile to all those who do not understand it. At first sight you might think it hostile to all human beings, because in every village you find the same suspicion and fear of the forest, that blank, impenetrable wall. The villagers are friendly and hospitable to strangers, offering them the best of whatever food and drink they have, and always clearing out a house where the traveler can rest in comfort and safety. But these villages are set among plantations in great clearings cut from the heart of the forest around them. It is from the plantations that the food comes, not from the forest, and for the villagers life is a constant battle to prevent their plantations from being overgrown.<br><br>They speak of the world beyond the plantations as being a fearful place, full of malevolent spirits and not fit to be lived in except by animals and BaMbuti, which is what the village people call the Pygmies. The villagers, some Bantu and some Sudanic, keep to their plantations and seldom go into the forest unless it is absolutely necessary. For them it is a place of evil. They are outsiders.<br><br>But the BaMbuti are the real people of the forest. Whereas the other tribes are relatively recent arrivals, the Pygmies have been in the forest for many thousands of years. It is their world, and in return for their affection and trust it supplies them with all their needs. They do not have to cut the forest down to build plantations, for they know how to hunt the game of the region and gather the wild fruits that grow in abundance there, though hidden to outsiders. They know how to distinguish the innocent-looking <i>itaba</i> vine from the many others it resembles so closely, and they know how to follow it until it leads them to a cache of nutritious, sweet-tasting roots. They know the tiny sounds that tell where the bees have hidden their honey; they recognize the kind of weather that brings a multitude of different kinds of mushrooms springing to the surface; and they know what kinds of wood and leaves often disguise this food. The exact moment when termites swarm, at which they must be caught to provide an important delicacy, is a mystery to any but the people of the forest. They know the secret language that is denied all outsiders and without which life in the forest is an impossibility.<br><br>The BaMbuti roam the forest at will, in small isolated bands or hunting groups. They have no fear, because for them there is no danger. For them there is little hardship, so they have no need for belief in evil spirits. For them it is a good world. The fact that they average less than four and a half feet in height is of no concern to them; their taller neighbors, who jeer at them for being so puny, are as clumsy as elephants -- another reason why they must always remain outsiders in a world where your life may depend on your ability to run swiftly and silently. And if the Pygmies are small, they are powerful and tough.<br><br>How long they have lived in the forest we do not know, though it is a considered opinion that they are among the oldest inhabitants of Africa. They may well be the original inhabitants of the great tropical rain forest which stretches nearly from coast to coast. They were certainly well established there at the very beginning of historic times.<br><br>The earliest recorded reference to them is not Homer's famous lines about the battle between the Pygmies and the cranes, as one might think, but a record of an expedition sent from Egypt in the Fourth Dynasty, some twenty-five hundred years before the Christian era, to discover the source of the Nile. In the tomb of the Pharaoh Nefrikare is preserved the report of his commander, Herkouf, who entered a great forest to the west of the Mountains of the Moon and discovered there a people of the trees, a tiny people who sing and dance to their god, a dance such as had never been seen before. Nefrikare sent a reply ordering Herkouf to bring one of these Dancers of God back with him, giving explicit instructions as to how he should be treated and cared for so that no harm would come to him. Unfortunately that is where the story ends, though later records show that the Egyptians had become relatively familiar with the Pygmies, who were evidently living, all those thousands of years back, just where they are living today, and leading much the same kind of life, characterized, as it still is, by dancing and singing to their god.<br><br>When Homer refers to the Pygmies, in describing a battle between Greek and Trojan forces in the <i>Iliad,</i> he may well be relying on information from Egyptian sources, but the element of myth is already creeping in.<br><br><i>When by their sev'ral chiefs the troops were rang'd,<br><br>With noise and clamour, as a flight of birds,<br><br>The men of Troy advanc'd; as when the cranes,<br><br>Flying the wintry storms, send forth on high<br><br>Their dissonant clamours, while o'er th'ocean stream<br><br>They steer their course, and on their pinions bear<br><br>Battle and death to the Pygmaean race.</i><br><br>By Aristotle's time the We. stem world was evidently still more inclined to treat the Pygmies as legend, because Aristotle himself has to state categorically that their existence is no fable, as some men believe, but the truth, and that they live in the land "from which flows the Nile."<br><br>Mosaics in Pompeii show that, whether the Pygmies were believed to be fable or not, the makers of the mosaics in fact knew just how they lived, even the kinds of huts they built in the forest. But from then until the turn of the present century, our knowledge of the Pygmies decreased to the point where they were thought of as mythical creatures, semi-human, flying about in tree tops, dangling by their tails, and with the power of making themselves invisible. The cartographer who drew the thirteenth-century Mappa Mundi, preserved in Hereford Cathedral, England, located the Pygmies accurately enough, but his representations show them as subhuman monsters.<br><br>Evidently there was still some question as to their reality up to the seventeenth century, because the English anatomist Edward Tyson felt obliged to publish a treatise on "The Anatomy of a Pygmie compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man." He had obtained from Africa the necessary skeletons, on which he based his conclusion that the so-called "pygmie" was, quite definitely, not human. The "pygmie" skeleton was preserved until recently in a London museum, and it was easy to see how Tyson arrived at so firm a conclusion. The skeleton was that of a chimpanzee.<br><br>Portuguese explorers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were responsible for many of the more extravagant accounts. It may well be that they actually did see Pygmies near the west coast of Africa, or they may have seen chimpanzees and mistaken them for Pygmies. But it is curious that they should have thought of the Pygmies as being able to make themselves invisible, and also as haying the power, small as they were, to kill elephants. The Pygmies today still kill elephants single-handed, armed only with a short-handled spear. And they blend so well with the forest foliage that you can pass right by without seeing them. As for their having tails, it is easy enough to see how this story came into being, if the Pygmies seen by the Portuguese dressed as they do today, as is more than likely. The loincloth they wear is made of the bark of a tree, softened and hammered out until it is a long slender doth, tucked between the legs and over a belt, front and back. The women particularly like to have a long piece of cloth so that it hangs clown behind, almost to the ground. They say it looks well when dancing.<br><br>Some of the accounts of nineteenth-century travelers in the Congo are no less fanciful, and it was George Schweinfurth who first made known to the world, in his book <i>The Heart of Africa,</i> that Pygmies not only existed but were human. He was following in the path of the Italian explorer Miani, who a few years earlier had reached the Ituri but had died before he could return. One of the most curious of little-known stories about the Pygmies is that Miani actually sent two of them back to Italy, to the Geographic Association, which had sponsored his trip. The president of the association, Count Miniscalchi of Verona, took the two boys and educated them. Contemporary newspaper reports describe them as strolling the boulevards, arm in arm with their Italian friends, chatting in Italian. One of them even learned to play the piano. From the present Count Miniscalchi I learned that both Pygmies eventually returned to Africa, where one died and the other became a saddler in the Ethiopian army. He last heard from the latter, who must then have been an old man, just before the outbreak of World War II.<br><br>Stanley describes his meetings with the Pygmies in the Ituri, but without telling us much about them, and indeed little was known beyond the actual fact of their existence until a White Father, the Reverend Paul Schebesta, set out from Vienna in the nineteen-twenties to study them.<br><br>Schebesta's first trip was an over-all survey of the forest area, in which he established the fact that this was a stronghold of the pure Pygmy, as opposed to the "Pygmoid" in other parts of the equatorial belt, where there has been intermarriage with Negro tribes. In subsequent trips Schebesta gathered material which showed that these Ituri Pygmies -- whose term for themselves, BaMbuti, he adopts -- are in fact racially distinct from the Negro peoples, Bantu and Sudanic, who live around them. This fact has been confirmed by later genetic studies, up to the present. Though we cannot be sure, it seems reasonable to assume that the BaMbuti were the original inhabitants of the great tropical rain forest stretching from the west coast right across to the open savanna country of the east, on the far side of the chain of lakes that divides the Congo from East Africa.<br><br>But when I read Schebesta's account of the Pygmies it just did not ring true when compared with my own experiences on my first trip to the Ituri. For instance, in one of his first books he says that the Pygmies are not great musicians, but that they sing only the simplest melodies and beat on drums and dance wild erotic dances. Even much later, after he had come to know the Pygmies better and had spent several years in the region, when he wrote his major work, running to several volumes, he devoted only a few pages to musk, attributing little importance to it and dismissing it as simple and undeveloped. This could not have been further from the truth.<br><br>In several other ways I felt that all was not well with Schebesta's account, particularly with his description of the relationship between Pygmies and Negroes. He gave the impression that the Pygmies were dependent on the Negroes both for food and for metal products and that there was an unbreakable hereditary relationship by which a Pygmy and all his progeny were handed down in a Negro family, from father to son, and bound to it in a form of serfdom, not only hunting but also working on plantations, cutting wood and drawing water. None of this was true of the Pygmies that I knew. But I did agree with Schebesta about the <i>molimo</i> (a religious festival). Although he had not seen it himself, from what he heard about it and about similar practices among other groups of Pygmies, he felt sure that it was essentially different from the practices of neighboring Negroes, however similar they might appear to be on the surface. This certainly tallied with my own experience.<br><br>The general picture that emerged from his studies was that there were, living in the Ituri Forest, some 35,000 BaMbuti Pygmies, divided into three linguistic groups, speaking dialects of three major Negro languages. The Pygmies seemed to have lost their own language, due to the process of acculturation though traces remained, especially in tonal pattern. Only in the easternmost group did Schebesta feel that the language had survived to any recognizable extent. These were the Efe Pygmies who lived among the BaLese, an eastern Sudanic tribe with a not very savory reputation for cannibalism, witchcra...</p><h2>Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence</h2><p>Most people know the importance of the Declaration of Independence, but few know much about its signers.

At five o&#x2019;clock in the morning, the man was whistling. Lindsey Norris grabbed an extra pillow and plopped it over her face, making a sandwich out of her head. It blocked out the chipper sound coming from the bathroom, but it also made breathing a challenge. She shifted and tried to make an air duct for her nose and mouth without letting in any sound. Sucking in a breath of cool early morning air, she tried to get back to her blissful unconscious state.</p><p>Her brain refused to be lulled. It was too busy being irritated. What sort of person whistled first thing in the morning? Her boyfriend, Captain Mike Sullivan, that&#x2019;s who. The man woke up <i>before</i> the sun rose every day, even on days he didn&#x2019;t have to. It was positively unnatural. Lindsey had moved into Sully&#x2019;s house several months ago, and while she loved him and she loved living with him, there were just a few things that made living together a bit tense, not the least of which was Sully&#x2019;s egregious habit of greeting every day whistling like a songbird at sunrise.</p><p>A former navy man who owned his own boat touring and water taxi company, Sully was used to being up and out before anyone else. Lindsey was not. She was the library director for their small town of Briar Creek, and as a public servant, she kept bankers&#x2019; hours, with an evening and rotating weekends thrown in just to keep it interesting.</p><p>Great, now her mind was on work. Lindsey did a quick mental rundown of her day, hoping that by thinking it through, she could put it aside and fall back to sleep. She had a meeting at nine o&#x2019;clock with the library board, which had been in transition since its last president had been murdered. She hadn&#x2019;t yet gotten a read on the new members and what their expectations of the library were. Mostly, they seemed relieved after every meeting to still be alive. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what that said about her as a library director. She decided to bring muffins and hope that relaxed them a bit. After all, everyone liked muffins.</p><p>At lunch, she had a crafternoon scheduled. This was a weekly Thursday meeting where they shared lunch, did a craft, and talked about a book. Lindsey wasn&#x2019;t a crafty sort, so this week&#x2019;s string bracelets were not really her thing, but her library assistant, who was in charge of the craft, assured her that the worst that could happen would be that she&#x2019;d suffer a small burn. Lindsey made a mental note to put some antibiotic pain-relief ointment in her purse.</p><p>Lastly, she had a late meeting with the mayor to discuss making the library a more environmentally friendly space by changing out the current lighting with more energy-efficient LEDs. The mayor was all about the bottom line and never welcomed ideas, even good ones, that would cost money in the immediate election cycle. His ideas for the future didn&#x2019;t run much past getting reelected. She was going to have to come up with a compelling reason for the change to get him to listen to her. Maybe she could convince him that this would get him the youth vote in the next election.</p><p>Today was definitely a &#x201c;look professional&#x201d; day. Pity. She would have preferred to wear her book-lover pajamas to work, comfy flannel pj&#x2019;s covered in a repeating pattern of eyeglasses and flying books. It was April in Connecticut, still on the chilly side in the morning, but the afternoon would be warmer. Her navy blue business suit with the pencil skirt and tailored jacket would work. She wondered whether she&#x2019;d gotten her jade green blouse back from the dry cleaners&#x2014;that would lighten up the severity of the suit but still give her executive polish.</p><p>How much time had passed since the whistling started? Why hadn&#x2019;t she fallen back to sleep? Could she fall back to sleep now? Lindsey tried to gauge her level of tiredness. Her brain was fully engaged; sleep was going to remain a memory for the rest of the day. Darn it.</p><p>Her nose twitched. What was that smell? Mmm. Coffee. She peeked one eye out from under her pillow. Freshly showered and shaved, Sully was approaching with a steaming mug of coffee in one hand. He carefully put it on her nightstand. The man brought her coffee; that was the definition of <i>true love</i> in Lindsey&#x2019;s book. His unfortunate whistling was immediately forgiven.</p><p>She reached out from under the covers and grabbed his hand before he could escape. He allowed her to pull him down, and he crouched beside the bed and peered under the pillow.</p><p>&#x201c;You awake in there?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>Lindsey tossed the pillow aside. &#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Sully studied her with a small smile on his lips. &#x201c;Good morning. I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re awake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; she asked. She didn&#x2019;t mention the whistling.</p><p>&#x201c;What time did you finally put the book down last night?&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey glanced at the floor, where the book she&#x2019;d been reading had landed when she&#x2019;d fallen asleep. &#x201c;One thirty, maybe two.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the morning?&#x201d; Sully asked. He ran a hand through his reddish brown hair, making the curly waves stand on end.</p><p>&#x201c;I was suffering from OMC syndrome,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;OMC, is that some sort of insomnia?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of. It stands for <i>one more chapter.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Book nerd,&#x201d; Sully teased. Then he leaned forward and kissed her on the nose before standing up.</p><p>Lindsey yawned. &#x201c;Yes, I am, and I have no read-grets, not even for missed sleep. The book was that good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that another made-up word?&#x201d; he asked. Lindsey nodded. &#x201c;Fine, then here&#x2019;s one for you. If you don&#x2019;t get moving, you&#x2019;re going to have to break the read-o-meter to get to work on time. It&#x2019;s already eight fifteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What! I thought it was five. You always get up at five.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not today,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have a late boat tour, plus I was tired because somebody keeps their light on into the wee hours of the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gah!&#x201d; Lindsey lurched from the bed, dislodging her dog, Heathcliff, from where he was resting his head on her knee. She grabbed the hot mug of coffee and slurped some as she hurried into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.<br></p><p>&#x201c;You look awful, like someone left you out in the rain, tossed you on the floor of their car, where you were stepped on for a few months, and then they stuffed you in the book drop and pretended they had no idea how you got into such bad shape,&#x201d; Beth Barker said. She stared down at Lindsey, who was sprawled on the couch in the crafternoon room at the back of the library.</p><p>&#x201c;Gee, thanks,&#x201d; Lindsey said. She opened her eyes and glanced at her best friend, who was also the children&#x2019;s librarian. &#x201c;That means so much coming from a woman who is dressed like a pigeon.&#x201d;</p><p>Wearing an oversize gray sweatshirt that had big, round eyes and a beak sewn onto the hood, Beth flapped her arms, which had been fashioned into wings, and then clasped them in front of her in a begging pose. &#x201c;Please, can I drive the bus? I&#x2019;ll be your best friend.&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey snorted. No one could act out Mo Willems&#x2019;s <i>Don&#x2019;t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!</i> better than Beth.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re already my best friend,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Which is why I forgive you for saying I look awful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a book hangover, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Paula Turner entered the room, pushing a cart full of craft materials. &#x201c;Was it <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i>, our discussion book today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I finished that one a few days ago. This was one I picked up on the way out of work last night. I couldn&#x2019;t put it down,&#x201d; Lindsey admitted.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the worst&#x2014;the best, but also the worst,&#x201d; Beth said. She plopped down on the couch.</p><p>Lindsey draped her arm over her eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t that she wished her friends would go away exactly, but she had almost managed a fifteen-minute power nap. She had read somewhere that fifteen- to twenty-minute naps could refresh a person without sending them into such a deep sleep that they were groggy all day. Oh, how she wished for that right now.</p><p>&#x201c;What was it? A thriller, romantic suspense, murder mystery?&#x201d; Paula asked. She tossed her thick blue braid over her shoulder while she set up the large table at the side of the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for a good read.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thriller,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;But the author killed off one of my favorite characters at the end, and all I could think was <i>No, take me instead!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hate that,&#x201d; Nancy Peyton said as she entered the room. &#x201c;It destroys me when an author kills off a character I&#x2019;m fond of, especially in a series.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But sometimes it has to be done,&#x201d; Violet La Rue said as she followed her best friend in. &#x201c;You have to trust the author to be true to the story they need to tell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not if it breaks my heart, I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Nancy insisted. Her bright blue eyes sparked with a fierce light as she tossed her short bobbed silver hair as if emphasizing her point. &#x201c;I will break up with an author over something like that.&#x201d;</p><p>Nancy Peyton had lived in the village of Briar Creek all her life, making her a true Creeker. She&#x2019;d been married to Captain Jake Peyton, and when his boat went down in a storm, she had never remarried or left her home, choosing to make their captain&#x2019;s house into a three-family apartment building. Lindsey had rented the third floor from her before she moved in with Sully.</p><p>Nancy&#x2019;s partner in crime in all manner of shenanigans was her best friend, Violet La Rue. Violet had retired to Briar Creek after a long career on the Broadway stage. With her dark skin and warm brown eyes, she was still a great beauty, and with her silver hair scraped back into a bun at the back of her head, her cheekbones dominated her heart-shaped face, which had delivered famous lines from the likes of William Shakespeare and Sam Shepard to appreciative audiences all over the world.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re being thick,&#x201d; Violet said. &#x201c;Think of all the great works of literature and how they would be different if the author didn&#x2019;t follow their vision. Take <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>&#x2014;it had to end the way it did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did it?&#x201d; Lindsey asked. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t they have communicated better and ended up living together in some faraway land? Then again, maybe it would have ended exactly the same if they&#x2019;d gotten married and Juliet discovered Romeo was a morning person who whistled really loudly while he shaved, and one morning she just snapped.&#x201d;</p><p>The room became quiet as her friends stopped talking to stare at her.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You and Sully have been living together for six months, right?&#x201d; Violet asked. She sat in an available armchair by the couch, and Nancy did the same.</p><p>&#x201c;Something like that,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>Nancy exchanged a look with Violet and nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? No!&#x201d; cried Beth. &#x201c;How could it be over? It took them forever to get together.&#x201d; She bounced forward on the couch and reached for Lindsey&#x2019;s hand, looking devastated. &#x201c;I mean, if you and Sully can&#x2019;t make it, Aidan and I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are still in your honeymoon phase,&#x201d; Violet interrupted. &#x201c;Relax. You&#x2019;re fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, thank goodness.&#x201d; Beth sagged with relief and dropped Lindsey&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve barely gotten used to being Mrs. Barker. I&#x2019;m not ready for things to go sideways on us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sully and I are fine,&#x201d; Lindsey insisted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that living with someone, even an awesome someone, is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Annoying, irritating, exasperating, all the &#x2018;-ings,&#x2019;&#x201d; Nancy said. &#x201c;I remember the first few months I was married to Jake, I fantasized about clobbering him with a frying pan more times than I can count.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Communication is the key,&#x201d; Violet said. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s just what I&#x2019;ve been told. I was married to my career, so I&#x2019;m not really a go-to person when it comes to relationship advice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about you, Paula?&#x201d; Beth asked. &#x201c;You and Hannah have been living together for the same amount of time as Lindsey and Sully. Is she getting on your nerves, too?&#x201d;</p><p>Paula glanced at Lindsey. She cringed and shook her head. &#x201c;Sorry. But maybe I&#x2019;m getting on her nerves. I&#x2019;ll check and get back to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey laughed. &#x201c;Thanks, but I wouldn&#x2019;t want to stir up any trouble. Probably, my reading until two in the morning gets on his nerves, but Sully&#x2019;s too polite to say anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He is very nice,&#x201d; Nancy said.</p><p>&#x201c;And he&#x2019;s a man,&#x201d; Violet said. &#x201c;They have different expectations.&#x201d;</p><p>The two women exchanged another glance, and Lindsey turned to Beth, who shrugged. She and Aidan Barker had gotten married just a few weeks ago, and she&#x2019;d been walking on clouds ever since. In other words, she was useless.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, people, I have the craft supplies set up. Where is Ms. Cole? Isn&#x2019;t she in charge of food today?&#x201d; Paula asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The lemon&#x2014;er&#x2014;Ms. Cole was in the staff lounge last I saw,&#x201d; Beth said. Ms. Cole was the newest member of their crafternoon group. During the first two years that Lindsey had worked at the library, Ms. Cole had been full of disapproval, and her puckered disposition had caused Beth to dub her &#x201c;the lemon.&#x201d;</p><p>But they&#x2019;d been through some dire times at the library, and Ms. Cole had softened toward her fellow librarians and had actually asked to join their book club and invited them to call her Ginny. The new name didn&#x2019;t take, however, and she remained Ms. Cole to them&#x2014;and occasionally, when she was being particularly rigid, she was still the lemon. But there was affection there now, too, which made all the difference.</p><p>&#x201c;She was loading up a cart full of food,&#x201d; Beth continued. &#x201c;I really hope she made her charlotte russe to go with the book. I love that ladyfinger, raspberry-gelatiny goodness that she made for the last holiday staff party.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Should we start on our craft then?&#x201d; Paula asked.</p><p>Beth popped up from her seat first, and the ladies made their way to the craft table.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we late? I tried so hard to get here on time, but babies have their own schedules.&#x201d; Mary Murphy, Sully&#x2019;s younger sister, hurried into the room with a baby in a sling across her chest and a padded bag the size of a small car strapped to her back.</p><p>As if she knew she was the topic of the conversation, the wee person strapped to Mary&#x2019;s front shoved a tiny fist into the air and then let out a not-so-delicate wail.</p><p>&#x201c;Josie&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; Nancy clapped her hands in delight.</p><p>Simultaneously, she and Violet rushed forward as if they were in a race to see who could get their hands on the baby first. Given that Violet was the taller of the two women and her stride longer, she beat Nancy by a grabby hand.</p><p>Mary plopped the baby into Violet&#x2019;s arms and dropped the bag onto the floor. She then collapsed onto the couch, looking like she didn&#x2019;t intend to move for the rest of the hour.</p><p>Both Beth and Paula moved forward to get in line for their turn with the baby. Lindsey did not. She loved little Josie Murphy&#x2014;after all, she was Sully&#x2019;s niece and hands down the cutest baby Lindsey had ever seen&#x2014;but Lindsey was not really a baby person. She didn&#x2019;t have any younger siblings, just her older brother Jack, and had never babysat while she was growing up. While a clean, sleeping baby was an adorable thing to gaze upon, when they got messy or wailed she found them somewhat terrifying.</p><p>She backed up to allow the others access to the baby. Little Josie did not seem to mind being passed around like a hot dish at the dinner table, but still, Lindsey knew what was coming.

El y su esposa B�rbara residen en la costa pacifica del noroeste de los Estados Unidos.<p> <strong>Prologue</strong> </p> <p> He stood motionless in the entryway, staring at his own shadow splayed before him like a stain upon the floor. He studied the patina of dust, sampled the stench of mold and rat urine, listened to a beam settling one more fraction of an inch toward the center of the earth. </p> <p> This room bore so little evidence of the events that had led to the dawn. From this vantage point, it was just one more abandoned house. Interesting. </p> <p> But the rest of the house told the truth. </p> <p> Beneath his boots, the floorboards lay shoulder to shoulder like the buried dead, cupped with creeping moisture, edges buckling, obscured by gray dust and fallen flakes of white paint. </p> <p> Across the foyer, at the base of a wall, the rose-printed wallpaper fluttered. Behind one of the roses, something scratched, pushed, gnawed, and clawed until a black, whiskered nose burst through. With a wad of shredded wallpaper in its jaws, the rat wriggled through the hole, then rested on its haunches and met his eyes. Neither found the other's presence alarming. The rat skittered along the baseboard and disappeared around a corner. </p> <p> At the far end of the room, half a tattered curtain rustled and stirred before a broken window. A pitiful attempt at escape. Apart from the broken window, there was no sign that anyone had been here in years. </p> <p> But when some curious passerby--or the police, should they be so fortunate as to stumble upon this place--wandered farther in, they'd find signs to the contrary in abundance. And those signs would lead them to the mysteries below. </p> <p> Death lingered in the musty air, even up here. The walls were like shrouds, enfolding every space in exquisite darkness. It had been a perfect arena for a perfect game. </p> <p> And already Barsidious White was looking forward to the next. </p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p> <strong>Chapter 1</strong> </p> <p> 5:17 PM </p> <p> "JACK, YOU'RE GONNA KILL US!" </p> <p> His mind jerked out of a daydream and back to the lonely Alabama highway in front of the blue Mustang. The speedometer topped eighty. He cleared his mind and relaxed his right foot. "Sorry." </p> <p> Stephanie went back to her singing, her voice clear if melancholy, her inflection classic country. <em>"My heart holds all secrets; my heart tells no lies . . ." </em></p> <p> That one again. She wrote it, so he never criticized it, but those awful lyrics, especially today-- </p> <p> "Jack!" </p> <p> The speedometer was inching toward eighty again. "Sorry." He forced his foot to relax. </p> <p> "What's the matter with you?" </p> <p> "What's the matter--" <em>Easy now, Jack. No fuel on the fire. </em>"A little tense, okay?" </p> <p> She smiled at him. "You should try singing." </p> <p> His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Yeah, that's your answer for everything, isn't it?" </p> <p> "Excuse me?" </p> <p> He sighed. He had to quit taking her bait. "Sorry." Always apologizing. He looked her way and forced a smile, hoping she would believe it. </p> <p> She smiled back in a way that said she didn't. </p> <p> She was beautiful, enough to capture the next man just as she'd captured him--blond, youthful, a real credit to those jeans--everything the guys in the lounges and bars could want in a country singer. No doubt those blue eyes could still sparkle, but not for him anymore. Right now they were hiding behind fashion-statement sunglasses, and she was craning to see out the back. "I think there's a cop behind us." </p> <p> He checked the rearview mirror. The highway, which had narrowed to two lanes, curved lazily through late-spring forest and farmland, rose and fell over dips and rises, hiding and revealing, hiding and revealing a single car. It was gaining on them, near enough now for Jack to recognize the light bar atop the roof. He checked his speed. Sixty-five. That should be legal. </p> <p> The police car kept coming. </p> <p> "Better slow down." </p> <p> "I'm doing the speed limit." </p> <p> "You sure?" </p> <p> "I can read the signs, Steph." </p> <p> A few seconds more and the cruiser filled Jack's mirror as if he were towing it. He could see the cop's iron-jawed countenance behind the wheel, reflective black sunglasses obscuring the eyes. </p> <p> Highway patrol. </p> <p> Jack double-checked the speedometer, then slowed to sixty, hoping the cop wouldn't rear-end them. </p> <p> The sedan inched closer. </p> <p> He was going to rear-end them! </p> <p> Jack smashed the gas pedal to the floor, and the Mustang shot ahead. </p> <p> "What are you doing?" Stephanie cried. </p> <p> "He was gonna hit us!" </p> <p> The car fell back ten yards. Its red and blue lights flashed to life. </p> <p> "Oh, great," she muttered, turning and flopping back against her seat. He could hear the blame in her voice. Always the blame. <em>But </em><em>you're the one who walked away, Steph.</em></p> <p> The cruiser veered into the oncoming lane and pulled up beside them. The uniformed officer turned his face to Jack. Met his eyes. Or so Jack imagined. Black glasses. No expression. Jack forced his eyes back to the road. </p> <p> The two cars were side by side, locked in formation at sixty miles an hour. </p> <p> "What are you doing, Jack? Pull over." </p> <p> He would if he could. Jack strained to see an opportunity. The forest, a thick tangle of maple, oak, and birch draped with kudzu, encroached like an advancing wall. "I can't. There's no shoulder. I can't just . . ." </p> <p> He slowed. There had to be a turnout somewhere. Forty miles per hour. Thirty. The cruiser matched his speed. </p> <p> Jack saw a break in the foliage, a sliver of a shoulder, just enough room. He began to veer off. </p> <p> The cruiser surged and left them behind, lights blazing in silence. Fifteen seconds later it was a dot on the road between the towering trees, and then it was gone. </p> <p> "What was that about?" Jack asked, checking his mirrors, rubbernecking, and easing back onto the highway. He wiped a sweaty palm on his jeans. </p> <p> "You were speeding." She fixed her gaze on the highway, fumbled with a map, avoided his eyes. </p> <p> "He didn't pull us over. Why was he so close? You see how close he was?" </p> <p> "That's Alabama, Jack. You don't do things their way, they let you know." </p> <p> "Yeah, but you don't ram someone in the tail for speeding." </p> <p> She slapped her lap, a release of frustration. "Jack, will you please just get us there, legally, in one piece? Please?" </p> <p> He chose silence over a comeback and concentrated on the road. <em>Save it for the counseling session, Jack. </em>He wondered what she'd been saving up, what new claims she'd unload tonight. </p> <p> She shook out her shoulders, put on a smile, and started humming. </p> <p><em> You really think it will work, don't you Jack? You really think you can save something you just don't have anymore? </em></p> <p> If smiling and singing could bring back those days, he would laugh like a fool and even sing Stephanie's lyrics, but he was fresh out of illusions. All he had were the memories that stole his mind away even as his eyes remained on the road: her arms about his shoulders and the excitement in her eyes; the inner dawn he felt whenever she entered the room; the secrets they shared with a glance, a smile, a wink; all the things he thought life and love should be-- </p> <p> The accident changed everything. </p> <p> He imagined himself sitting in the counselor's office, being honest about his feelings<em>. I'm feeling . . . like I've been had all my life.</em><em>Life is pointless. If there is a God, he's the devil, and . . . What was</em><em>t hat? Oh, you mean Stephanie? No, I've lost her too. She's gone. I</em><em> mean, she's here, but she's checked out . . .</em></p> <p> He couldn't put away the idea that this whole trip was only a formality, another nail in the coffin of their marriage. Steph would sing her way to Montgomery and back and still get the divorce she wanted, go on her merry way. </p> <p> "Jack, you're lost." </p> <p><em> I sure am. </em></p> <p> "Jack." </p> <p> With a start, he returned his attention to driving. The Mustang purred along at sixty-five, gobbling up the highway. The forest was breaking up now, giving way to crude homesteads and stump-filled pastureland. </p> <p> She was scanning the map, studying all those little red and black lines. Did she say <em>he </em>was lost? Right. <em>She </em>was holding the map, but <em>he </em>was lost. </p> <p> He caught the sarcasm before it escaped. Hurtful words came so easily these days. "What do you mean?" </p> <p> "Didn't you see that highway marker? It said 5." </p> <p> He glanced at the mirror, then twisted to see the back of the receding sign. "5?" </p> <p> She studied the map, tracing a route with her finger. "We're supposed to be on Highway 82." </p> <p> He leaned and tried to read the map. The car swerved. He shot his eyes forward again, corrected the wheel. </p> <p> "We're going to be late," she said. </p> <p><em> Not necessarily. </em> "You see Highway 5 on there? Where does it lead?" </p> <p> She dragged her finger over the map and stopped about three inches out of Montgomery. "Not to Montgomery, unless you have a week to sightsee. How could you possibly have gotten off 82?" </p> <p> Dare he defend himself ? "I was a little distracted by a cop eating up my bumper." </p> <p> She pulled her cell phone out of a cup holder and checked the display clock. "There's no way we'll make it." </p> <p> Was that hope in her voice? He checked his watch. If they turned around now, maybe-- </p> <p> "I canceled a gig to go to this appointment with you." Stephanie hunched in the seat, arms folded. </p> <p><em> There it is again. My fault. </em> She started humming. <em>There it is again. </em></p> <p> Red and blue lights flashed up ahead. </p> <p> "Oh, great," Stephanie said. "We <em>really </em>don't need this." </p> <p> Jack slowed as they approached the patrol car parked just beyond a turnoff. Orange cones and a sign blocked the road ahead."Repaving Operation. Highway Closed to Through Traffic," Jack read. "Well, we have to turn around anyway." Jack pulled onto the gravel shoulder but had a second thought. "Let's ask. Maybe there's a faster way." </p> <p> Jack eased the blue Mustang forward, up to the turnoff, and stopped a few feet behind the patrol car. The cruiser's door swung open and an officer--the officer--stepped out, aviator sunglasses still hiding his eyes. </p></p><h2>Collected Poems 1943-2004</h2><p>With a distinguished career spanning more than sixty years, Richard Wilbur stands as one of America's preeminent men of letters.

Life gets more interesting, however, when his father becomes the Buddha of Suburbia, beguiling a circle of would-be mystics. And when the Buddha falls in love with one of his disciples, the beautiful and brazen Eva, Karim is introduced to a world of renegade theater directors, punk rock stars, fancy parties, and all the sex a young man could desire. A love story for at least two generations, a high-spirited comedy of sexual manners and social turmoil, The Buddha of Suburbia is one of the most enchanting, provocative, and original books to appear in years.</p><p>There's quite a bit of activity in <i>Buddha of Suburbia</i>. A bureaucrat becomes a suburban guru who marries a follower with a son who's a punk rocker named Charlie Hero.

On the description of suburban life: "We were proud of never learning anything except the names of footballers, the personnel of rock groups and the lyrics to 'I Am the Walrus.'"

It presents the Sicangu dialect using an orthography developed by Lakota in 1982 and which is now supplanting older systems provided by linguists and missionaries. This new approach represents a powerful act of self-determination for Indian education.<br><br>Though&nbsp;<i>Reading and Writing the Lakota Language</i>&nbsp;is thorough in its inclusion of conjugation, syntax, and sentence, it emphasizes vocabulary and pronunciation. Author Albert White Hat Sr. presents Lakota philosophy as it applies to specific grammar lessons. Moreover, he documents the impact of the acculturation process on the language, showing how Lakota evolved as a result of non-Indian influences. The textual example offers new information and interpretation of Lakota society, even to scholars who specialize n Plains cultures. Beyond language instruction, readers will value the book for its cultural insights, humorous stories, and its entertaining tone.</p><p>&nbsp;Albert White Hat, Sr.&nbsp;is a professor at Sinte Gleska University.It is easy to confuse the distinction between male and female speech. In recent times, many visitors have come to the reservation who attempted to use greetings and acknowledgments without learning the proper usage from local Lakota speakers. One time, in an inipi ceremony (a purification ceremony), a woman was visiting the lodge. Every time the Medicine Man prayed or made a comment, she responded loudly, &#34;Hau, hau,&#34; instead of saying, &#34;To!&#34; or &#34;Haye!&#34; like the other women. As the Medicine Man continued with his prayers, he expressed a message from the spirits and this woman responded loudly, saying, &#34;Hokahe,&#34; a male expression meaning &#34;Let&#39;s go. It&#39;s time to start.&#34; The Medicine Man couldn&#39;t control himself any longer. He started to laugh and almost forgot to convey the rest of the messages.</p><h2>Kingdom of Priests: A History of Old Testament Israel</h2><p>From the origins and exodus to the restoration and new hope, Kingdom of Priests offers a comprehensive introduction to the history of Old Testament Israel. Merrill explores the history of ancient Israel not only from Old Testament texts but also from the literary and archeological sources of the ancient Near East. After selling more than 30,000 copies, the book has now been updated and revised. The second edition addresses and interacts with current debates in the history of ancient Israel, offering an up to date articulation of a conservative evangelical position on historical matters.

The text is accented with nearly twenty maps and charts.<br><br>"<i>Kingdom of Priests</i> has served several generations of students and colleagues with distinction, so it is with delight that I welcome this second edition. Judiciously updated throughout, its most important improvement is the engagement of recent historiographical discussions, including a burgeoning literature among evangelicals. I am pleased to recommend it."--<b>David M. Howard</b>, professor of Old Testament, Bethel Seminary<br><br>"The second edition of Eugene Merrill's now classic <i>Kingdom of Priests</i> is a model of the seamless relationship of Old Testament history and theology. While technically a history of Israel, updated and refurbished by the latest biblical research, this book illustrates by its structure, style, and content that OT history was written for theological purposes. But history is not the unwitting servant of theology; rather, they stand alongside one another as co-servants of the message of redemption."--<b>C. Hassell Bullock</b>, professor emeritus of Hebrew Bible, Wheaton College<br><br>"In <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, Eugene Merrill follows a sound methodology that uses explicitly stated and well-reasoned principles in analyzing Old Testament events. He demonstrates how the 'facts' of Old Testament history emerge only after sound hermeneutics that give attention to issues of style, genre, and rhetorical strategies are applied to the biblical text. Merrill provides historical background for each biblical book and period of Israel's history and gives up-to-date information from extrabiblical sources regarding nations and rulers with whom Israel often found itself in conflict. This work is a crowning achievement of a distinguished career devoted to the study of Old Testament history and is destined to become the standard evangelical treatment of biblical history for decades to come."--<b>Mark F. Rooker</b>, senior professor of Old Testament and Hebrew, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<b>Eugene H. Merrill</b> (PhD, Bob Jones University; PhD, Columbia University) is distinguished professor of Old Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary in Dallas, Texas, where he has taught since 1975.

Merrill is the author of a number of books, including <i>A Historical Survey of the Old Testament</i>, <i>Everlasting Dominion: A Theology of the Old Testament</i>, and a commentary on Deuteronomy.</p><h2>Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth</h2><p><b>*Finalist for the National Book Award and the Kirkus Prize*<br> *Instant <i>New York Times </i>Bestseller*</b><br> *<b>Named a Best Book of 2018 by NPR, <i>The New York Post, </i>BuzzFeed, Shelf Awareness, <i>Bustle</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i>*</b><br> <br> <b>An essential read for our times: an eye-opening memoir of working-class poverty in America that will deepen our understanding of the ways in which class shapes our country.</b><br><br>Sarah Smarsh was born a fifth generation Kansas wheat farmer on her paternal side, and the product of generations of teen mothers on her maternal side. Through her experiences growing up on a farm thirty miles west of Wichita, we are given a unique and essential look into the lives of poor and working class Americans living in the heartland.<br> <br> During Sarah&#x2019;s turbulent childhood in Kansas in the 1980s and 1990s, she enjoyed the freedom of a country childhood, but observed the painful challenges of the poverty around her; untreated medical conditions for lack of insurance or consistent care, unsafe job conditions, abusive relationships, and limited resources and information that would provide for the upward mobility that is the American Dream. By telling the story of her life and the lives of the people she loves with clarity and precision but without judgement, Smarsh challenges us to look more closely at the class divide in our country.<br> <br> A beautifully written memoir that combines personal narrative with powerful analysis and cultural commentary, <i>Heartland</i> examines the myths about people thought to be less because they earn less.<br> <br> &#x201c;A deeply humane memoir that crackles with clarifying insight, <i>Heartland</i> is one of a growing number of important works&#x2014;including Matthew Desmond&#x2019;s <i>Evicted</i> and Amy Goldstein&#x2019;s <i>Janesville</i>&#x2014;that together merit their own section in nonfiction aisles across the country: America&#x2019;s postindustrial decline...Smarsh shows how the false promise of the &#x2018;American dream&#x2019; was used to subjugate the poor. It&#x2019;s a powerful mantra&#x201d; <b>(<i>The New York Times Book Review)</i></b><i>.</i></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2018:</strong> In this furious, regretful, and loving memoir, Sarah Smarsh examines the life of America&#x2019;s rural poor through the microcosm of her extended family. Growing up working-class white on the Kansas plains, Smarsh enjoyed the freedom of a country childhood, but witnessed the hideous legacy of poverty in her relatives&#x2019; untreated illnesses, unsafe job conditions, abusive marriages, and addictions to everything from cigarettes to opioids. <p>Smarsh, now a writer and professor, created a stable professional life for herself using the same work ethic she saw in her parents, with talents they themselves might have developed had they been able to continue in school. What made the biggest difference: federal grants for first-generation students, and her determination to avoid early pregnancy. Her life&#x2019;s work, she felt, &#x201c;was to be heard,&#x201d; rather than to become a mother, though the daughter she might have had feels so real that <em>Heartland</em> takes the form of an anguished letter to her. </p> <p>For Smarsh, one of the cruelest blows the poor suffer is society&#x2019;s assessment that they somehow deserve less than others. &#x201c;People of all backgrounds experience a sense of poorness&#x2014;not enough of this or that thing that money can&#x2019;t buy. But financial poverty is the one shamed by society, culture, unchecked capitalism, public policy, our very way of speaking.&#x201d; <em>Heartland</em> will make you check your privilege before you refer to anyone as &#x201c;white trash&#x201d; or &#x201c;red neck,&#x201d; and if you&#x2019;re standing at a polling station, you might hear Smarsh&#x2019;s voice in your ear. Her portrayal of what it feels like to be poor in America will persuade you that it&#x2019;s not a fate any child should be born into. <em>&#x2014;Sarah Harrison Smith, Amazon Book Review</em></p>Sarah Smarsh has written about socioeconomic class, politics, and public policy for the&nbsp;<i>Guardian</i>, the&nbsp;<i>New</i><i>&nbsp;York&nbsp;Times</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Texas Observer</i>,&nbsp;<i>Pacific Standard</i>, the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, and many other publications.

Now she delivers <i>The Gathering</i>, a moving, evocative portrait of a large Irish family and a shot of fresh blood into the Irish literary tradition, combining the lyricism of the old with the shock of the new. The nine surviving children of the Hegarty clan are gathering in Dublin for the wake of their wayward brother, Liam, drowned in the sea. His sister, Veronica, collects the body and keeps the dead man company, guarding the secret she shares with him something that happened in their grandmother&#x2019;s house in the winter of 1968. As Enright traces the line of betrayal and redemption through three generations her distinctive intelligence twists the world a fraction and gives it back to us in a new and unforgettable light. <i>The Gathering</i> is a daring, witty, and insightful family epic, clarified through Anne Enright&#x2019;s unblinking eye. It is a novel about love and disappointment, about how memories warp and secrets fester, and how fate is written in the body, not in the stars.</p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, November 2007</b>: Pretty early on in <i>The Gathering</i> you realize that in her lingering portrait of the Hegarty clan (and this isn't hyperbole--they are a family of 12), Irish novelist Anne Enright will wrestle with all the giant literary tropes that have come before her. Family, of course, is the big one, but with equal intensity she explores death and dying, the sea and its siren song, sex, shame, secrecy, unreliable memories, madness, "the drink," and--always in the shadows--England. That said, it's not like any other novel about the Irish that I've read. The story of the Hegartys is indeed bleak, and hard, but it surges with tenderness and eloquent thought which, in the end, are the very things that help this family (or at least her narrator Veronica) survive. Through her eyes, and in Enright's skillful imagination, those small turning-point moments of life that we all know in some form or another--a petty fight, a careless word, an event witnessed--come together in an unshakeable vision of how you become the person you are.<i> --Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br>Anne Enright was born in Dublin, where she now lives and works. She has published two collection of stories, collected as Yesterday&#39;s Weather, one book of non-fiction, Making Babies, and five novels, including The Gathering, which was the Irish Novel of the Year, and won the Irish Fiction Award and the 2007 Man Booker Prize, and The Forgotten Waltz, which was awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.

Devious children, sparring lovers, capricious American girls, obtuse bachelors, sibylline spinsters and charming Europeans populate these five fascinating <i>Nouvelles</i> --works which represent the author in both his early and late phases. From the apparitions of evil that haunt the governess in <i>The Turn Of The Screw</i> to the startling self-scrutiny of an egotistical man in <i>The Beast In The Jungle</i>, the mysterious turnings of human behavior are skillfully and coolly observed--proving Henry James to be a master of psychological insight as well as one of the finest stylists of modern English literature.Henry James was born on April 15, 1843, on Washington Place in New York to the most intellectually remarkable of American families. His father, Henry Jane Sr., was a brilliant and eccentric religious philosopher; his brother was the first great American psychologists and the author of the influential Pragmatism; his sister, Alice, though an invalid for most of her life, was a talented conversationalist, a lively letter writer, and a witty observer of the art and politics of her time.<br><br>In search of the proper education for his children, Henry senior sent them to schools in America, France, Germany, and Switzerland. Returning to America, Henry junior lived in Newport, briefly attended Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began contributing stories and book reviews to magazines. Two more trips to Europe led to his final decision to settle there, first in Paris in 1875, then in London next year.<br><br>James's first major novel, Roderick Hudson, appeared in 1875, but it was "Daisy Miller" (1878) that brought him international fame as the chronicler of American expatriates and their European adventures. His novels include <i>The American</i> (1877), <i>Washington Square</i> (1880), <i>Princess Casamassima</i> (1886), and the three late masterpieces, <i>The Wings of the Dove</i> (1902), <i>The Ambassadors</i> (1903) and <i>The Golden Bowl</i> (1904). He also wrote plays, criticism, autobiography, travel books (including <i>The American Scene</i>, 1907) and some of the finest shot stories in the English language.<br><br>His later works were little read during his lifetime but have since come to be recognized as forerunners of literary modernism. Upon the outbreak of World War I, James threw his energies into war relief work and decided to adopt British citizenship. One month before his death, in 1916, he received the Order of Merit from King George V.</p><h2>The Iliad / The Odyssey</h2><p>Gripping listeners and readers for more than 2,700 years, <b>The Iliad</b> is the story of the Trojan War and the rage of Achilles. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, <b>Robert Fagles</b> brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. If <b>The Iliad</b> is the world's greatest war story, then <b>The Odyssey</b> is literature's greatest evocation of every man's journey through life. Here again, Fagles has performed the translator's task magnificently, giving us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Each volume contains a superb introduction with textual and critical commentary by renowned classicist <b>Bernard Knox.</b> <p><br> about <b>The Odyssey</b></p></p><p>This is a boxed gift edition of Fagles's two widely acclaimed translations of Homer. <p> <i>The Iliad</i> is typically described as one of the greatest war stories of all time, but to call it a war story does not begin to describe the emotional sweep of its action and characters: Achilles, Helen, Hector, and other heroes of Greek myth and history in the 10th and final year of the Greek siege of Troy. <i>The Odyssey</i> is, quite simply, the story of Odysseus, who wants to go home. But Poseidon, god of oceans, doesn't want him to make it back across the wine-dark sea to his wife, Penelope, son, Telemachus, and their high-roofed home at Ithaca. The story is told in easy-going, beautiful poetry; the characters speak naturally, the action happens briskly. Even the gods come across as real people, despite the divine powers they exercise constantly. Both works have been hailed by scholars and the public for the powerful language that brings clashing, pulsing life to these ancient masterpieces.</p><b>Now available again�a beautiful hardcover gift set of Robert Fagles�s award-winning translations of Homer</b> <p> <b>Translated by Robert Fagles<br> Introduction and notes by Bernard Knox</b> </p> <p> Praise for <i>The Iliad:</i><br> "Plain and direct, noble, above all rapid . . . leading the reader forward with an irresistible flow.

You should come with us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What a coincidence,&#x201d; I said, gazing up at the clear blue sky. It was early fall and the weather was warm and sunny with a slight breeze. Perfect for walking along the town square. &#x201c;I was just on my way to Emily&#x2019;s to fix a stopped-up sink. I&#x2019;ll walk with you.&#x201d; I surreptitiously brushed my hand over my mop of curly hair, hoping to swipe away as much sawdust as I could. &#x201c;But I should probably pass on lunch. I&#x2019;ve been working at the old Parton mansion all morning, redoing the staircase. I&#x2019;m covered in wood shavings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re used to seeing you like that,&#x201d; she said with a grin. &#x201c;Emily won&#x2019;t mind. We&#x2019;ll just hose you down before we go inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so sweet.&#x201d; Our friend Emily Rose owned the popular Scottish Rose Tea Shoppe on Main Street, facing the town square. She made the absolute best sandwiches and tiny delectable pastries. My mouth began to water just thinking about them. And that settled it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to join you if you&#x2019;re sure I&#x2019;m not interrupting anything.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed. &#x201c;Since our whole point in having lunch is to talk about Chloe&#x2019;s visit, you won&#x2019;t be interrupting anything and you should definitely be there.&#x201d;</p><p>I cocked my head in confusion. &#x201c;You and Lizzie are talking about my sister?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Shannon,&#x201d; Jane said with infinite patience. &#x201c;You know she&#x2019;ll be here in two short months, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you know she asked me to help book the hotel rooms for the crew and the production staff, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I picked up my toolbox. Jane slipped her arm through mine and we strolled toward Lizzie&#x2019;s bookshop a half block away. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t heard that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she did and I&#x2019;m thrilled to do it. But it&#x2019;s going to take some jockeying and planning, as you might imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe it.&#x201d; Chloe was the co-star of Makeover Madness, a popular rehab and design show on the Home Builders Network. I was thrilled with her success and overjoyed that the show was coming to Lighthouse Cove to feature some of our beautiful old Victorian mansions. And I was pleased to hear that my best friends were jumping in to help make the visit a success.</p><p>&#x201c;But what&#x2019;s Lizzie doing?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Is she helping you make reservations?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no. I can do that on my own. But Chloe was hoping that Lizzie will stock her new book and maybe host a book signing while she&#x2019;s in town. So a few of us decided to get together to work out all the schedules and logistics.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My sister, the superstar,&#x201d; I murmured. I still couldn&#x2019;t believe that Chloe had recently published her very own book on home rehab, design, and d�cor. She had sent me an advance copy and it was gorgeous. Her accomplishments had far exceeded everyone&#x2019;s expectations&#x2014;including her own&#x2014;and I couldn&#x2019;t be happier or prouder of her.</p><p>Jane squeezed my arm. &#x201c;She really is a star. And besides, she&#x2019;s our hometown girl. We&#x2019;re all excited to see her again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d; I meant it. Especially since my little sister rarely came home anymore, except for the occasional holiday. And even then, she would sneak into town for a day or two and be gone before we&#x2019;d even had a chance to catch up on old times.</p><p>Chloe had left town ten years ago, the summer after she graduated from high school. It had been her dream to make it big in Hollywood, and she&#x2019;d been determined to do whatever it took to make that happen.</p><p>She had started out as a lowly office go-fer and in her spare time she worked for a local theater company building sets. And after a few years&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it happened. She was discovered in that theater, not as an actress but as a carpenter. A producer hired her for a bit part on a DIY Network show and from there she went on to hit the big time as co-host of Makeover Madness. With her innovative ideas and her talent as a contractor, she helped turn that show into the highest-rated program on the network. It didn&#x2019;t hurt that she was smart and talented and beautiful, but viewers loved her most of all because she had the best sense of humor and absolutely loved her job.</p><p>And now, besides being a TV star, Chloe would soon be a bestselling author. Did I mention how ridiculously proud of her I was? Who would&#x2019;ve thought that hanging out on construction sites with our dad all those years ago would turn out to be so profitable for both of us?</p><p>I&#x2019;m Shannon Hammer, a building contractor specializing in Victorian home renovation. My hometown is listed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation because of its hundreds of Victorian-era houses and buildings, so it made sense that Chloe would eventually bring her television show back home to Lighthouse Cove. She and her producers planned to shoot a series of episodes featuring major rehab jobs on Victorian homes. And the best news of all was that Chloe wanted me to work on the houses with her. Me! I was beyond excited.</p><p>But that didn&#x2019;t mean I was totally on board with Chloe allowing Jane to do all this heavy lifting for her staff and crew. Had my sister gone so completely Hollywood that she didn&#x2019;t think about the &#x201c;little&#x201d; people anymore? That didn&#x2019;t sound like Chloe at all. I wondered if maybe she was just overly stressed and pressed for time.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m still confused,&#x201d; I said to Jane. &#x201c;Chloe&#x2019;s producers usually arrange all the travel details. Why did she ask you to do it?&#x201d;</p><p>Jane smiled. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t really ask. She just called to get some information on hotels and the next thing I knew, I was on the phone with her executive producer, Bree Bennett, who wanted to hear all about Hennessey House. How many rooms we have, our rates, what meals and amenities are included, you know. We worked out a few specifics and I told her I&#x2019;d take care of everything else.&#x201d;</p><p>I frowned. &#x201c;Everything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Her staff and crew are going to need a lot more rooms than I have available, so I offered to take care of booking the Inn on Main Street for them.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded slowly. &#x201c;That makes sense. You&#x2019;re kind of an expert in that regard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; she said with a confident smile. Jane had been the manager of the inn for five years before she opened her Hennessey House, a massive Victorian mansion left to her by her grandmother. &#x201c;And then Bree called back for more info and I happened to mention that Emily&#x2019;s catering company could provide pastries and coffee every day. And then Chloe called to ask about the book signing, so that got Lizzie involved. And then Emily reminded me that Gus has a limousine service if anyone on the show wanted to use it. And, well, here we are.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane and I had gone to school with gorgeous Gus Peratti, the best auto mechanic in town and the guy who had won Emily&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>I smiled, feeling better knowing that Chloe wasn&#x2019;t running our friends crazy. Not personally, anyway. And besides, nobody here seemed to mind. At least, not so far. I would have to make sure that once the production people arrived, they didn&#x2019;t steamroll Jane, Lizzie, Emily, and everyone else in town. &#x201c;So you managed to get the whole gang involved. I&#x2019;m officially impressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And we&#x2019;re all going to get credit on the show. Isn&#x2019;t it wonderful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very cool,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I just hope you&#x2019;re not too busy to handle all this extra work. If it starts to feel like Chloe&#x2019;s imposing on you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; Jane laughed. &#x201c;It just feels that way to you because she&#x2019;s your sister. I, on the other hand, am totally psyched. It&#x2019;s sort of like I&#x2019;m working in showbiz, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>I chuckled. &#x201c;Showbiz-adjacent, anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Close enough,&#x201d; she said breezily. &#x201c;Besides, Chloe is so sweet.&#x201d;</p><p>Sweet? Chloe? I loved my sister, but that was not a word I would normally apply to her. Smart, savvy, a little snarky, sure. But sweet? I wondered just how thickly she&#x2019;d laid on the sweetness. On the other hand, my friends weren&#x2019;t exactly na�ve. Especially Jane, who had known Chloe her whole life. If she and the others didn&#x2019;t want to do the work, they wouldn&#x2019;t have volunteered. Still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>I glanced up at Jane, who was two inches taller than me&#x2014;and had been since first grade when we were the two tallest kids in class, a fact that had bonded us for life. &#x201c;If you feel like you&#x2019;re about to freak out from all the demands, just call Chloe and tell her to get the producers to take over. They&#x2019;re used to doing this kind of stuff. And I can help, too. With&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No way would I dump my work on you,&#x201d; she said adamantly. &#x201c;First of all, you&#x2019;ve got your own arrangements to take care of, right?&#x201d;</p><p>True, I thought. I was supposed to scout out three or four run-down Victorian houses ripe for rehab. The producers would come to town in the next week or so and choose a few of them to be featured on the show. Chloe also wanted me to line up four or five other smaller interior jobs that the two of us would tackle for the show&#x2019;s website. And in the meantime, I had a bunch of ongoing jobs that would start to get backed up as I spent more time working on the TV show projects.</p><p>&#x201c;And second,&#x201d; Jane continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a ton of people offering to help me. This is going to go off without a hitch.&#x201d;</p><p>Famous last words, I thought. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better knock on wood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very funny,&#x201d; she said, lightly elbowing me in the side.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m just kidding. It&#x2019;s going to be great.&#x201d; But as we passed one of the many sycamore trees that grew along Main Street, I reached out and knocked on the thick brown wood trunk. Because why tempt fate?</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>I met with Wade Chambers, my head foreman, at the site of one of the first houses on my Chloe list. I was already waiting by the tailgate when he climbed out of his truck and together we pulled the extension ladder out of the back.</p><p>&#x201c;They picked the Bloom house for the show?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of the four they&#x2019;re going to decide on,&#x201d; I said as we lugged the ladder up the walkway. &#x201c;I really hope they choose it because it&#x2019;s got great bones. The final result would be beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said, gazing up at the three-story tower. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s got all the Victorian elements and it would be perfect for the show. As long as it doesn&#x2019;t crumble and fall down between now and the time Chloe gets here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It could happen.&#x201d; In its heyday, this Queen Anne Victorian had surely been one of the more stately jewels of Lighthouse Cove. With its traditionally asymmetrical roofline, multiple gables, rounded front tower, and wraparound veranda, not to mention the overabundance of gingerbread trim, the home was a true classic. But it had been deserted for at least twenty years and, like Wade said, I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see the place collapse at any moment.</p><p>&#x201c;I ran into Margaret Bloom at the market,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She begged me to put in a good word. She told me she&#x2019;s spending every day in church, lighting candles and praying that the house gets chosen for Makeover Madness.&#x201d;</p><p>Wade chuckled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure it works that way.&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret still owned the house that had been in her family for six generations, but when she got married, she moved into her husband&#x2019;s home, a beautiful Eastlake-style Victorian over on Ivy Hill north of the town square. She had kept her maiden name of Bloom just as her three sisters had done since the Blooms had long been one of the most prominent families in Lighthouse Cove.</p><p>&#x201c;She told me they can&#x2019;t spare the money to refurbish both of their houses and according to the terms of her father&#x2019;s will, she can&#x2019;t sell this one. She&#x2019;ll have to pass it on to her kids eventually, but meanwhile, it&#x2019;s falling apart. She&#x2019;d be thrilled if Chloe and the producers choose it. That way, she can get the work done for free.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It definitely needs help,&#x201d; Wade said, glancing at the veranda. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s kind of a disaster and that&#x2019;s a damn shame.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Disasters are exactly what Chloe asked me to find for the show,&#x201d; I said with a grin. &#x201c;She told me to come up with some real stinkers.&#x201d;</p><p>He chuckled. &#x201c;Then she&#x2019;ll be very happy with this place. So what are we doing here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; I lifted the front of the ladder up. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go around to the side.&#x201d;</p><p>Wade grabbed the far end and we carried the heavy ladder around the side of the house to the point where the wraparound veranda ended. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s set it up right here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess I shouldn&#x2019;t complain that so many of the old houses are falling apart,&#x201d; Wade reasoned as he helped lean the ladder up against the side of the house. &#x201c;It keeps us gainfully employed.&#x201d;</p><p>I grinned at him over my shoulder. &#x201c;You got that right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I assume you&#x2019;re the one climbing up there.&#x201d; He grabbed hold of the railings. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it steady for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; I stared at the ladder, looking all the way to the top. I wasn&#x2019;t afraid of heights but this thing stretched up thirty-two feet. Even my most macho crew guys were a little daunted by the climb. My throat was suddenly dry. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a long way up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it still won&#x2019;t reach the peak of the gable,&#x201d; Wade said, pointing up at the decorative wood pieces tucked under the peak of the roof. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to get the boom lift out here if Chloe wants to restore those gable carvings.&#x201d;</p><p>My construction company owned a two-man boom lift with a basketlike platform and a fifty-two-foot articulated arm, the kind of thing the telephone company used to reach the highest electrical poles. It was an expensive piece of heavy equipment that my father had won in a poker game a few years back from the owner of our local hardware store. True story. Because of Dad&#x2019;s good fortune, we were happy to rent it out to other contractors when we weren&#x2019;t using it ourselves.</p><p>&#x201c;For now,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I just want to get close enough to check out the dentils along the eaves.&#x201d; Taking a fortifying breath, I slowly climbed thirty-some feet until I could reach out and examine the closest square wooden molding. But as soon as I touched the first one, my fingertips went right through the rotted wood. I tested a few more spots along the eave and found them all as badly damaged.</p><p>&#x201c;I was afraid of this,&#x201d; I shouted down to Wade. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get these repaired before Chloe shows up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because the wood is rotten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s part of the deal, isn&#x2019;t it? It actually looks kind of cool in a disturbing sort of way.&#x201d;</p><p>Was he smoking something? &#x201c;No, it doesn&#x2019;t. It looks plain old creepy. Decrepit, faded, and sad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Wade shouted cheerfully. &#x201c;Chloe will love it. She&#x2019;ll want to get some close-up shots of the rot first before we get to work making it beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed. He had a point. &#x201c;But I hate to think that people watching the show will be...</p></p><h2>Come Alive!: The Spirited Art of Sister Corita</h2><p>At 18, Corita Kent (1918-86) entered the Roman Catholic order of Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Los Angeles, where she taught art and eventually ran the art department. After more than 30 years, at the end of the 1960s, she left the order to devote herself to making her own work. Over a 35-year career she made watercolors, posters, books and banners--and most of all, serigraphs--in an accessible and dynamic style that appropriated techniques from advertising, consumerism and graffiti. The earliest, which she began showing in 1951, borrowed phrases and depicted images from the Bible; by the 1960s, she was using song lyrics and publicity slogans as raw material. Eschewing convention, she produced cheap, readily available multiples, including a postage stamp. Her work was popular but largely neglected by the art establishment--though it was always embraced by such design luminaries as Charles and Ray Eames, Buckminster Fuller and Saul Bass. More recently, she has been increasingly recognized as one of the most innovative and unusual Pop artists of the 1960s, battling the political and religious establishments, revolutionizing graphic design and making some of the most striking--and joyful--American art of her era, all while living and practicing as a Catholic nun. This first study of her work, organized by Julie Ault on the 20th anniversary of Kent&#39;s death, with essays by Ault and Daniel Berrigan, is the first to examine this important American outsider artist&#39;s life and career, and contains more than 90 illustrations, many of which are reproduced for the first time, in vibrant, and occasionally Day-Glo, color.</p><p>one of the most outspoken and well-known activists within the Catholic Church during the turbulent 1960s. Corita Kent, once known as Sister Mary Corita, I.H.M., never backed down from her desire to call people to the simplicity of the Gospel through revolutionary art.... Would the canon of modern art recognize a woman&#x2015;and a woman religious at that&#x2015;for contributions that equal those of her contemporary, Andy Warhol? (Suzanne Wielgos <i>America: The National Catholic Review</i>)<br><br>the bright billboards of California&#x2019;s freshly invented media landscape were Corita&#x2019;s chief inspiration; this places her in a continuum of religious artists... who have recognized that faith, when argued for visually, works well when grounded in the everyday. If Corita looks good to non-believers, it is because she pulls from her belief a blend of sunny optimism, delectation of reality and general sense of purpose (Martin Hebert <i>Frieze</i>)</p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Furniture: Third Edition - Completely Revised</h2><p>A completely revised edition, covering every period and development to the present, the designers and makers, the woods and other materials, the architecture and decoration. <b>2,000 photographs.</b> Glossary.

Taking as his territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being <i>us</i>. The result is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.<br><br>Now, in this handsome new edition, Bill Bryson&#x2019;s words are supplemented by full-color artwork that explains in visual terms the concepts and wonder of science, at the same time giving face to the major players in the world of scientific study. Eloquently and entertainingly described, as well as richly illustrated, science has never been more involving or entertaining.</p><p>From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> reports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably. Though <i>A Short History</i> clocks in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of <i>Life</i> and <i>Trilobite</i>) and these interviews are charming. But it's when Bryson dives into some of science's best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway Morris vs. Gould--that he finds literary gold. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>One of the world's most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer. <br>In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world's most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything" is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>The Wild Folk</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

And sometimes those ideas can be squeezed into slogans, slapped on bumper stickers and tweeted into cyberspace. These compact messages coming at us from all directions often compress in a few words entire ethical systems. It turns out that there's a lot more to the ideas behind these slogans--ideas that need to be sorted out before we make important moral decisions as individuals or as societies. In this revised and expanded edition of Steve Wilkens's widely-used text, the author has updated his introductions to basic ethical systems: <ul><li>cultural relativism</li><li>ethical egoism</li><li>utilitarianism</li><li>behaviorism</li><li>situation ethics</li><li>Kantian ethics</li><li>virtue ethics</li><li>natural law ethics</li><li>divine command theory</li></ul> He has also added two new chapters: <ul><li>evolutionary ethics</li><li>narrative ethics</li></ul> With clarity and wit Wilkens unpacks the complicated ideas behind the slogans and offers Christian evaluations of each.</p><p><strong>Steve Wilkens</strong> (Ph.D., Fuller Theological Seminary) is professor of philosophy and ethics at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, California.

When the Communists assume control of China in 1949, though, Ralph Chang, his sister Theresa, and his wife Helen, find themselves in a crisis.&nbsp;At first, they cling to their old-world ideas of themselves. &nbsp;But as they begin to dream the American dream of self-invention, they move poignantly and ironically from people who disparage all that is &#x201c;typical American&#x201d; to people who might be seen as typically American themselves. With droll humor and a deep empathy for her characters, Gish Jen creates here a superbly engrossing story that resonates with wit and wisdom even as it challenges the reader to reconsider what a typical American might be today.</p></p><p><p>Gish Jen&nbsp;is the author of four novels, a book of stories, and two books of nonfiction,&nbsp;<i>The Girl at the Baggage Claim </i>and&nbsp;<i>Tiger Writing</i>.

We meet him at age six. He doesn&#39;t know where or what America is, but he does know, already, that he&#39;s got round ears that stick out like the sideview mirrors of the only car in town--his father&#39;s. Often he wakes up to find himself tied by his ears to a bedpost, or else he finds loops of string around them, to which are attached dead bugs. &#34;Earrings!&#34; his cousins laugh. His mother tells him something like, It&#39;s only a phase. (This is in Shanghainese.) After a while the other boys will grow up, she says, he should ignore them. Until they grow up? he thinks, and instead--more sensibly--walks around covering his ears with his hands. He presses them back, hoping to train them to bring him less pain. Silly boy! Everyone teases him except his mother, who pleads patiently.&#34;That&#39;s not the way.&#34; She frowns. &#34;Are you listening?&#34; He nods, hands over his ears.&#34;How can you listen with your hands over your ears?&#34;He shrugs. &#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;Back and forth. Until finally, irked, she says what his tutor always says, &#34;You listen but don&#39;t hear!&#34;--distinguishing, the way the Chinese will, between effort and result. Verbs in English are simple. One listens. After all, why should a listening person not hear? What&#39;s taken for granted in English, though, is spelled out in Chinese; there&#39;s even a verb construction for this purpose. Ting de jian in Mandarin means, one listens and hears. Ting bu jian means, one listens but fails to hear. People hear what they can, see what they can, do what they can; that&#39;s the understanding. It&#39;s an old culture talking. Everywhere there are limits.As Ralph, who back then was not Ralph yet, but still Yifeng--Intent on the Peak--already knew. His mother wheedles, patient again. &#34;No hands on your ears during lessons, okay? As it is, you have trouble enough.&#34; If he stops, she promises, she&#39;ll give him preserved plums, mooncakes, money. If he doesn&#39;t, &#34;Do you realize your father will beat me too?&#34;&#34;Lazy,&#34; says his father. &#34;Stupid. What do you do besides eat and sleep all day?&#34; The upright scholar, the ex--government official, calls him a fan tong--a rice barrel. He has an assignment for his son: Yifeng will please study his Older Sister. He will please observe everything she does, and simply copy her.His Older Sister (Yifeng calls her Bai Xiao, Know-It-All) blushes.Hands over his ears, Yifeng presses, presses, presses.It&#39;s 1947; Yifeng&#39;s more or less grown up. The Anti-Japanese War has been over for two years. Now there&#39;s wreckage, and inflation, and moral collapse. Or so it seems to his father as, on a fan-cooled veranda, he entertains apocalyptic thoughts of marching armies, a new dynasty, the end of society as they know it.&#34;Might there be something nicer to talk about?&#34; suggests his mother.But his father will talk destruction and gloom if he wants to. Degeneracy! he says. Stupidity! Corruption! These have been his lifelong enemies; thanks to them he no longer holds office.&#34;Too much rice wine,&#34; muses Ralph&#39;s mother.This is in a small town in Jiangsu province, outside Shanghai, a place of dusty shops and rutted roads, of timber and clay--a place where every noise has a known source. Somewhere in the city, the girl who will become Helen hums Western love songs to herself; on a convent school diamond, Know-It-All (that is, Theresa) fields grounders from her coach. Ralph, though--Yifeng--is on his way home from his job at the Transportation Department. His mother knows this. As his father prepares to write an article--he has an inkstone out, and a wolf&#39;s hair maobi--his mother prepares to speak up.His father announces that he&#39;s going to write about Degeneracy! Stupidity! Corruption!&#34;America,&#34; his mother says then.His father goes on grinding his ink. Yifeng simply cannot be going abroad.&#34;But it seems, perhaps, that he is.&#34;Silence. His father&#39;s hand hovers over the inkstone, circling. He presses just so hard, no harder. He holds his ink stick upright.A fellowship from the government! Field training! His son, an advanced engineer! No one knows what&#39;s possible like a father. His ink blackens; and in the end he can&#39;t be kept from making a few discreet inquiries, among friends. This is how he discovers that things are indeed more involved than they at first appeared. Though Yifeng has scored seventeenth on the department exam, he is one of the ten picked to go.&#34;No door like a back door,&#34; says his father. &#34;Your only son,&#34; pleads his mother.His father looks away. &#34;Opposites begin in one another,&#34; he says. And, &#34;Yi dai qing qing, qi dai huai&#34;--one generation pure, the next good for nothing.Of course, in the end, Yifeng did come to the United States anyway, his stomach burbling with fool hope. But it was privately, not through the government, and not for advanced field training, but for graduate study. A much greater opportunity, as everyone agreed. He could bring back a degree!&#34;A degree,&#34; he echoed dully.His mother arranged a send-off banquet, packed him a black trunk full of Western-style clothes.&#34;Your father would like to give you this,&#34; she told him at the dock. As his father stared off into the Shanghai harbor--at the true ships in the distance, the ragtag boats by the shore--she slid a wristwatch into Yifeng&#39;s hand.Yifeng nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll remember him always.&#34;It was hot.On the way to America, Yifeng studied. He reviewed his math, his physics, his English, struggling for long hours with his broken-backed books, and as the boat rocked and pitched he set out two main goals for himself. He was going to be first in his class, and he was not going home until he had his doctorate rolled up to hand his father. He also wrote down a list of subsidiary aims.1. I will cultivate virtue. (A true scholar being a good scholar; as the saying went, there was no carving rotten wood.)2. I will bring honor to the family.What else?3. I will do five minutes of calisthenics daily.4. I will eat only what I like, instead of eating everything.5. 1 will on no account keep eating after everyone else has stopped.6. I will on no account have anything to do with girls.On 7 through 10, he was stuck until he realized that number 6 about the girls was so important it counted for at least four more than itself. For girls, he knew, were what happened to even the cleverest, most diligent, most upright of scholars; the scholars kissed, got syphilis, and died without getting their degrees.He studied in the sun, in the rain, by every shape moon. The ocean sang and spit; it threw itself on the deck. Still he studied. He studied as the horizon developed, finally, a bit of skin--land! He studied as that skin thickened, and deformed, and resolved, shaping itself as inevitably as a fetus growing eyes, growing ears. Even when islands began to heave their brown, bristled backs up through the sea (a morning sea so shiny it seemed to have turned into light and light and light), he watched only between pages. For this was what he&#39;d vowed as a corollary of his main aim--to study until he could see the pylons of the Golden Gate Bridge.That splendor! That radiance! True, it wasn&#39;t the Statue of Liberty, but still in his mind its span glowed bright, an image of freedom, and hope, and relief for the seasick. The day his boat happened into harbor, though, he couldn&#39;t make out the bridge until he was almost under it, what with the fog; and all there was to hear were foghorns. These honked high, low, high, low, over and over, like a demented musician playing his favorite two notes.How was anyone supposed to be able to read?Years later, when he told this story, he&#39;d claim that the only sightseeing he did was to make a trip back to the bridge, in better weather, to have his picture taken. Unfortunately, he forgot his camera. As for the train ride to New York--famous mountains lumbered by, famous rivers, plains, canyons, the whole holy American spectacle, without his looking up once.&#34;So how&#39;d you know what you were passing, then,&#34; his younger daughter would ask. (This was Mona, who was just like that, a mosquito.)&#34;I hear what other people talk,&#34; he&#39;d say--at least usually. Once, though, he blushed. &#34;I almost never take a look at.&#34; He shrugged, sheepish. &#34;Interesting.&#34;New York. He admitted that maybe he had taken a look around there too. And what of it? The idea city still gleamed then, after all, plus this was the city of cities, a place that promised to be recalled as an era. Ralph toured the century to date--its subway, its many mighty bridges, its highways. He was awed by the Empire State Building. Those pilings! He wondered at roller coasters, Ferris wheels. At cafeterias--eating factories, these seemed to him, most advanced and efficient, especially the Automats with their machines lit bright as a stage. The mundane details of life impressed him too--the neatly made milk cartons, the spring-loaded window shades, the electric iceboxes everywhere. Only he even saw these things, it seemed; only he considered how they had been made, the gears turning, the levers tilting. Even haircuts done by machine here! The very air smelled of oil. Nothing was made of bamboo.He did notice.By and large, though, he really did study. He studied as he walked, as he ate. The first week. The second week.The third week, however, what could happen even to the cleverest, most diligent, most upright of scholars (and he was at least diligent, he allowed) happened to him.&#34;She was some--what you call?--tart,&#34; he said.A BOYWITH HIS HATOVER HIS CROTCHPICTURE HIM. Young, orotund. Longish hair managed with grease. A new, light gray, too dressy, double-breasted suit made him look even shorter than his five feet three and three-quarter inches. Otherwise he was himself--large-faced, dimpled, with eyebrows that rode nervously up and up, away from his flat, wide, placid nose. He had small teeth set in vast expanses of gum; those round ears; and delicate, almost maidenly skin that tended to flush and pale with the waxing and waning of his digestive problems. Everywhere he went, he carried a Panama hat with him, though he never put it on, and it was always in his way; he seemed to have picked up an idea about gentlemen, or hats--something--that was proving hard to let go.In sum, he was a doll, and the Foreign Student Affairs secretary, though she loathed her job, loathed her boss, loathed working, liked him.&#34;Name?&#34; he repeated, or rather &#34;nem,&#34; which he knew to be wrong. He turned red, thinking of his trouble with long a&#39;s, th&#39;s, l&#39;s, consonants at the ends of words. Was it beneath a scholar to hate the alphabet? Anyway, he did.&#34;Naaame,&#34; she said, writing it down. She&#39;d seen this before, foreign students who could read and write and speak a little, but who just couldn&#39;t get the conversation. N-A-M-E.&#34;Name Y. F. Chang.&#34; (His surname as he pronounced it then sounded like the beginning of angst; it would be years before he was used to hearing Chang rhyme with twang.)&#34;Eng-lish-name,&#34; said Cammy. E-N-G-L-I-S-H-N-A-M-E.&#34;I Chin-ese,&#34; he said, and was about to explain that Y. F. were his initials when she laughed.&#34;Eng-lish-name,&#34; she said again.&#34;What you laughing?&#34;Later he realized this to be a very daring thing to ask, that he never would have asked a Chinese girl why she was laughing. But then, a Chinese girl never would have been laughing, not like that. Not a nice Chinese girl, anyway. What a country he was in!&#34;I&#39;m laughing at you.&#34; Her voice rang, playful yet deeper than he would have expected. She smelled of perfume. He could not begin to guess her age. &#34;At you!&#34;&#34;Me?&#34; With mock offense, he drew his chin back.&#34;You,&#34; she said again. &#34;Me?&#34; &#34;You.&#34; &#34;Me?&#34; They were joking! In English! Shuo de chu--he spoke, and the words came out! Ting de dong--he listened and understood!&#34;English name,&#34; she said again, finally. She showed him her typewriter, the form she had to fill out.&#34;No English name.&#34; How to say initials? He was sorry to disappoint her. Then he brightened. &#34;You give me.&#34;&#34;I-give-you-a-name?&#34;&#34;Sure. You give.&#34; There was something about speaking English that carried him away.&#34;I&#39;ll-hang-onto-this-form-overnight,&#34; she tried to tell him. &#34;That-way-you-find-a-name-you-like-better-you-can-tell-me-tomorrow.&#34;Too much, he didn&#39;t get it. Anyway, he waited, staring--exercising the outsider&#39;s privilege, to be rude. How colorful she was! Orange hair, pink face, blue eyes. Red nails. Green dress. And under the dress, breasts large and solid as earthworks. He thought of the burial mounds that dotted the Chinese countryside--the small mounds for nobodies, the big mounds for big shots. This woman put him in mind of the biggest mound he had ever seen: in Shandong, that was, Confucius&#39;s grave.Meanwhile, she ran through her ex-beaux. Robert? Eugene? Norman? She toyed with a stray curl. Fred? John? Steve? Ken? &#34;Ralph,&#34; she said finally. She wrote it down. R-A-L-P-H. &#34;Do you like it?&#34;&#34;Sure!&#34; He beamed.Walking home, though, Ralph was less sanguine. Had he been too hasty? He did this, he knew; he dispensed with things, trying to be like other people--decisive, practical--only to discover he&#39;d overdone it. His stomach puckered with anxiety. And sure enough, when he asked around later he found that the other Chinese students (there were five of them in the master&#39;s degree program) had all stuck with their initials, or picked names for themselves, carefully, or else had wise people help them.&#34;Ralph,&#34; said smooth-faced Old Chao (Old Something-or-another being what younger classmates called older classmates, who in turn called them Little Something-or-another). He looked it up in a book he had. &#34;Means wolf,&#34; he said, then looked that up in a dictionary. &#34;A kind of dog,&#34; he translated.A kind of dog, thought Ralph.For himself, Old Chao had Henry, which turned out to be the name of at least eight kings. &#34;My father picked it for me,&#34; he said.It would have been better if Ralph sounded a bit more like Yifeng; in the art of picking English names (which everyone seemed to know except him), that was considered desirable. But so what? And who cared what it meant? Ralph decided that what was on the form didn&#39;t matter. He was a man with a mission; what mattered was that he register for the right courses, that he attend the right classes, that he buy the right books. All of this proved more difficult than he&#39;d anticipated. He discovered, for instance, that he wasn&#39;t on the class list for two of his courses, and that for one of them, enrollment was already closed. To address these problems, he did what he did when his tuition didn&#39;t arrive, and when his other two classes turned out to meet at the same time: he found his way to the Foreign Student Affairs Office, where gaily colored Cammy would help him.</p><h2>Crowned and Moldering (A Fixer-Upper Mystery)</h2><p><b>Don't miss&nbsp;<i>Concrete Evidence</i>,&nbsp;a Hallmark Movies &amp; Mystery Original starring Jewel, based on&nbsp;<i>Crowned and Moldering</i>&#x2014;the third novel in the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Fixer-Upper Mystery series!</b><br><br>When Mac Sullivan&#x2014;famous thriller writer and Shannon&#x2019;s new beau&#x2014;first moved to Lighthouse Cove, California, he bought the historic lighthouse mansion that the town is named after.

Kate also writes the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Bibliophile Mysteries featuring Brooklyn Wainwright.<p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>I gazed up at the neglected beauty and tingled with excitement. I was so ready to turn this old eyesore into the grand masterpiece it had once been.</p><p>The venerable lighthouse mansion was situated on a large tract of land surrounded by a once-lovely green lawn that had become overgrown and scruffy with crabgrass and brown weeds. A fine layer of sand covered the entire expanse, having been carried by the wind from the dunes that bordered the beach nearby.</p><p>The lighthouse tower stood a few yards away to the north of the house. To the west, the rough, rocky breakwater speared into the sea. Waves crashed and a fine mist of salt water was spewed in every direction.</p><p>&#x201c;I love my job,&#x201d; I murmured as I grabbed the thick roll of blueprints from the narrow backseat of my truck. I slammed the door shut and marched across the sprawling lawn.</p><p>The rough March wind gusting off the ocean lifted my mop of wavy red hair and blew it around until I couldn&#x2019;t see straight. I finally had to stop at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the front porch or risk tripping on the steps. I set down the tool chest I was carrying and shoved the hair back off my face. And that&#x2019;s when I beheld the wondrous sight before me at the top of the stairway.</p><p>MacKintyre Sullivan, world-famous, bestselling thriller writer and former Navy SEAL, stood with his arms crossed as he leaned against one of the smooth Doric columns that braced the roof covering the wide porch. The man looked for all the world like some handsome, dashingly entitled lord of the manor&#x2014;<i>if</i> the lord of the manor happened to be an unrepentant pirate with a wicked smile and a gleam in his dark blue eyes.</p><p>Mac had moved to Lighthouse Cove, California, a few months ago and almost immediately looked into buying the famous mansion by the lighthouse. The purchase had to be approved by both the town Planning Commission and the Historical Society. Not only was the mansion a local landmark with a lot of history attached to it, but the new owner of the home would have to be responsible for upkeep of the lighthouse&#x2014;for which our town was named. Mac was willing to do the work.</p><p>&#x201c;Those are the new blueprints?&#x201d; Mac asked, pointing at the thick roll of papers in my hands. &#x201c;So this is it? No more delays?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No more delays&#x2014;I promise you.&#x201d; I picked up my tool chest and made my way up the eight steps and onto the sturdy wooden porch. Flashing him a determined smile, I added, &#x201c;And no more red tape from the Planning Commission. No more whining from the Historical Society. And, especially, no more tiny white rats to send me screaming from this house again.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed, and I couldn&#x2019;t blame him. It was still a source of deep embarrassment to me that a few weeks ago, I had spotted the little-bitty rodent skittering across the kitchen floor. With a shriek, I had dashed out of Mac&#x2019;s kitchen and hadn&#x2019;t stopped until I&#x2019;d made it all the way across the wide lawn to my truck.</p><p>What can I say? Rats creep me out.</p><p>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re finally ready to get started.&#x201d; He pushed away from the column and strolled toward me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve cleared my schedule for the next two weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect.&#x201d; Because, to be honest, Mac&#x2019;s busy schedule had also produced a number of holdups lately. Flying off to New York, meeting with editors, dining with agents, going on book tours. Deadlines. The world-famous writer was a busy man.</p><p>I recalled one more unhappy distraction that had occurred recently and prayed there would be no more funerals, please. We didn&#x2019;t need anyone else dying in Lighthouse Cove. Besides being unbearably sad, the recent suspicious death of a dear friend had indeed thrown a shocking wrench into the schedule, causing yet more delays to Mac&#x2019;s plans to start the renovation of his new home.</p><p>Another gust of wind rushed up from the ocean, but before it could whip my hair into a greater tangle of curls, I turned toward the wind and lifted my face to catch the mist.</p><p>&#x201c;Man, I love it out here,&#x201d; Mac said, sliding his hands into the pockets of his Windbreaker.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good day.&#x201d; Cold, windy, with dark clouds forming out on the horizon; there would be rain within a few hours. Still, it was wonderful to be here, ready to begin the job of rehabbing the most iconic house in Lighthouse Cove for the hunky Mac Sullivan.</p><p>I checked my watch, eager to begin. Once my guys and I finished going through the house with Mac, I would work out a schedule and make up a list of supplies and equipment we would need. And within a few days, my crew and I would start restoring this wonderful old Victorian to its former glory.</p><p>That was why Mac had hired me, after all. My name is Shannon Hammer, and I&#x2019;m a building contractor specializing in Victorian-home renovation and rehab. I had taken over my father&#x2019;s construction business five years ago when Dad suffered a mild heart attack and decided to retire. Since then, I liked to think I&#x2019;d proven to my clients that the best man for the job is often a woman. Namely, me.</p><p>&#x201c;Wade and the guys should be here any minute,&#x201d; I said, referring to my foreman, Wade Chambers, and two of my most reliable crew members, Sean Brogan and Johnny Schmidt.</p><p>&#x201c;In that case,&#x201d; Mac said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get this out of the way.&#x201d; And with that, he pulled me into his arms and kissed me.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t protest. I should&#x2019;ve, but instead I sighed and wrapped my arms around his neck, reveling in the warmth of his touch. This really was not a good idea. And I would put a stop to it any minute now.</p><p>A truck horn sounded out on the highway and I jolted and took a quick step backward. It took me a moment to catch my breath. &#x201c;Uh, that must be the guys.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac was smiling broadly as he let go of me. &#x201c;Must be.&#x201d;</p><p>I coughed softly, knowing the guys&#x2019; truck wouldn&#x2019;t actually show up in front of Mac&#x2019;s house for another minute or two. I just needed to give myself a few more seconds to recover from the unexpected kiss. &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed and stroked my hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m crazy about you, Irish.&#x201d;</p><p>I was kind of crazy about him, too. But since I was afraid of setting myself up for a fall, I gave him a weak smile and said nothing.</p><p>Mac and I had grown close over the past few months, since he&#x2019;d moved to Lighthouse Cove. It helped that he&#x2019;d rented the guest apartment over my garage and lived only a few yards away from me. We&#x2019;d had a few late-night adventures while chasing down a killer and, yes, there had been a few kisses. I had hoped that maybe we&#x2019;d grow closer and, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway, things got complicated the morning I saw him escorting a gorgeous blond supermodel out of his apartment. Ever since then I&#x2019;d been rethinking the idea of getting involved with one of the most sought-after bachelor millionaires in the world.</p><p>I probably should&#x2019;ve demanded to know what he&#x2019;d been thinking by flirting with me while seeing some supermodel on the side. But it wasn&#x2019;t like me to be pushy that way, an obvious flaw in my character. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;I could be plenty assertive in other areas, but when it came to men and dating and such, I tended to hold back. Considering my checkered dating history, it made sense. In the past nine years, I&#x2019;d dated exactly three men. One turned out to be gay, another was a car thief, and the third ended up dead&#x2014;or, to put it more bluntly, murdered. Was it any wonder that I didn&#x2019;t want to probe too much? Better to just walk away with my sanity and ego intact.</p><p>That was one more reason why I should&#x2019;ve ended the kiss as soon as it began. Another was that kissing a client on the job probably wasn&#x2019;t the most professional thing I could&#x2019;ve been doing right then, especially with my crew guys about to drive up at any second. But did that stop me? Obviously not.</p><p>In my defense, Mac was a world-class kisser.</p><p>I shook off those thoughts and took the opportunity to study the elegant old porch. It was wide and stretched across most of the front and halfway along the north side of the house, following the curve of the corner tower. Double Doric columns gave the graceful, circular porch a worldly style that belied the mansion&#x2019;s utilitarian roots. With its incomparable ocean view, the porch could be turned into a wonderful outdoor living/dining space.</p><p>Currently, though, it was pretty shabby. The floor planks were dull and a few of the boards around the outer edges were spongy and crumbling after sustaining years of damage from the sun and ocean air. Once those boards were replaced, we could re-sand the surface and add several coats of clear varnish, and all of it would be shiny and new again.</p><p>Things wouldn&#x2019;t go so easy for the beams above our heads. The porch roof had actually begun to sag from water damage, and those rotten headers and crossbeams would need replacing immediately. The sooner we started work on this portion of the house, the better. I figured if I could see the wood decomposing with my own eyes, it had to be even worse beneath the surfaces.</p><p>I jotted down more notes on my tablet and then used the device to take some photographs of the decaying beams in order to remind myself how bad the damage was.</p><p>Wade&#x2019;s truck finally came into view and Mac jogged down the steps and over to meet the guys. I took the moment to regroup, breathing in more ocean air and staring at the spectacle of waves tumbling and crashing against the rocky coastline.</p><p>Once I&#x2019;d cleared my head and regained my senses&#x2014;that kiss really was more potent than I&#x2019;d realized&#x2014;I was able to relax and watch Wade&#x2019;s truck jerk and buck to a stop. There was nothing wrong with his truck; the lurching was due to the timeworn cracks and potholes that pitted Old Lighthouse Road, right up to the edge of Mac&#x2019;s property. I had a feeling he would want to repave the path eventually, unless he liked replacing tires on his SUV more often than usual.</p><p>I waved to my guys, who were unloading their tool chests and ladders, with Mac lending a hand. Since they had things under control, I continued making notes on the exterior repairs needed to make to bring the house back to its former splendor.</p><p>For some unknown reason, people in Lighthouse Cove had always called this place the lighthouse mansion. Yes, the house stood within a few yards of the lighthouse, but it was the <i>mansion</i> part of the phrase that had always seemed misleading. That was because our town was famous for its abundance of breathtakingly massive Victorian homes, while Mac&#x2019;s new place wasn&#x2019;t all that large. But the home had a quiet, stately presence, unencumbered by the ostentatious gingerbread detailing that Victorians were known for. The term <i>mansion</i> just seemed to suit it.</p><p>Despite the lack of decorative clutter, the mansion still had many of the classic Queen Anne features, including the convoluted roof lines, the seemingly random placement and sizes of the windows, the multiple chimneys, and the many different surface textures that changed from floor to floor and gable to gable.</p><p>On the second floor, a shingled overhang sheltered a set of arched Palladian windows braced by more Doric columns. I made a note to check those charming old fish-scale shingles for termite damage. A small balcony off the master bedroom on the second floor cried out for a new railing. The copper gutters circling the third-floor tower would have to be replaced. I could see the gaping holes from where I was standing.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t seen the basement yet, but according to the blueprints, it ran the entire length and width of the house. You didn&#x2019;t see that feature in many Victorian homes, and if Mac wanted to, he could probably create the biggest man cave in town. But chances were good that some load-bearing posts and a beam or two would have to be replaced before any other work could occur. Wind and water damage was the price a homeowner paid to have a house this close to the shoreline.</p><p>I took a quick walk down the steps and around to the south side of the house, where a jewel-box-sized solarium had been built to connect with the first-floor parlor, or living room. It was a true rarity, made of strong white galvanized wrought iron and tempered-glass panels. I stared through one of the windows and saw the worn brick floor in a room just large enough to contain a few dozen plants and some potted trees, along with a small conversation area made up of a settee and a chair or two. It would be the perfect sunny place to read a book or take a nap.</p><p>The presence of a solarium might&#x2019;ve seemed frivolous at first glance, but I&#x2019;d read that the navy had built it specifically to grow citrus trees in pots, in order to provide juice for the sailors who were once stationed here. No scurvy for those boys.</p><p>Past the solarium was the root cellar with its thick wooden door, detached, deteriorating, and leaning against the side of the house. As I&#x2019;d noted on my last visit, there were shutters hanging off their frames and several bricks missing from the chimney at the back of the house. The paint on most of the exterior walls was peeling badly, but there was plenty of other work to be done before we could start scraping, sanding, and painting.</p><p>Call me perverse, but seeing all the damage just made me more excited to explore the entire house. I took a quick moment to stare up at the spectacular sight of the lighthouse tower standing sentinel over the town and this stretch of the coast. It never failed to impress me with its clean white surface shooting one hundred feet into the sky. I&#x2019;d climbed its spiral wrought-iron staircase many times over the years and knew the view at the top was sensational. Gazing up at the glass-walled lantern room at the very top, I wondered if Mac had ever been up there. I would have to remember to ask.</p><p>I circled back to the front where Sean, Johnny, Wade, and Mac were trudging up to the porch with tool chests, a ladder, and other equipment for the walk-through.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, boss,&#x201d; Sean said, laying his eight-foot ladder down at the far end of the porch and out of the way.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, guys,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are we ready to get started?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bet,&#x201d; Wade said.</p><p>Johnny nodded. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Even though I had a key to the front door, I gestured to Mac. &#x201c;You go ahead. It&#x2019;s your new home.&#x201d;</p><p>He unlocked the door, walked in, and looked around. I knew he was familiar with the first &#x2013; and second-floor rooms, but he&#x2019;d never seen the whole place from attic to basement. Mac had bought the house after barely half an hour of walking through a few rooms and strolling around the property. That was all the time it had taken for him to fall in love and make an offer.</p><p>&#x201c;I had the power and water reconnected a few weeks ago,&#x201d; Mac said, &#x201c;so the lights should work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If there are still any bulbs in the fixtures,&#x201d; Wade said.</p><p>Mac grinned. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>Wade flicked the nearest light switch and the foyer lit up nicely, thanks to the old-fashioned chandelier hanging from the twelve-foot-high ceiling. &#x201c;Oh, man. This place is awesome. Look at all that mahogany paneling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I ran my hand over the rich wood surface of the stairwell. Unlike some Victorian entryways that were dark and narrow and barely had room to hold an umbrella stand, this one was a large square, well-lit room. On one side of the foyer was a double doorway leading into a paneled living room, and on the other was a...</p></p><h2>Practitioner&#39;s Guide to Using Research for Evidence-Based Practice</h2><p><p><b>Praise for the previous edition</b></p> <p>"An extraordinary and important book.

In THE BORROWERS AFLOAT they must find a new home after the departure of the human occupants from the cottage the tiny family has been calling home. This time they take to the river in a tea kettle as they head to a new home in Fordham Village, a model village. This tale is full of rich characterizations of the humans and vivid descriptions of the settings. Some books must be narrated by a British voice, and Norton&#39;s tales are such books. Lucky for us, Rowena Cooper is up to the task. She also does well switching voices from male to female characters, always managing to keep clear the notion that the Borrowers are small folks.

Whether such purpose has to do with what job to take, whether to get married, or how to incorporate religious faith into the texture of their lives, Christians down the centuries have believed that God has plans for them. This unprecedented anthology gathers select passages on work and vocation from the greatest writers in Christian history. William Placher has written insightful introductions to accompany the selections &#x2014; an introduction to each of the four main historical sections and a brief introduction to each reading. While the vocational questions faced by Christians have changed through the centuries, this book demonstrates how the distilled wisdom of these saints, preachers, theologians, and teachers remains relevant to Christians today. This rich resource is to be followed by a companion volume, edited by Mark R. Schwehn and Dorothy C. Bass, featuring texts drawn mainly from fiction, memoir, poetry, and other forms of literature.

Afterward he lived in New York, the city of choice for political exiles, and eventually arrived in Washington, D.C., at the newly minted National Museum of the American Indian (&#x201c;a bad idea whose time has come&#x201d;) as a curator. In his journey from fighting activist to federal employee, Smith tells us he has discovered at least two things: there is no one true representation of the American Indian experience, and even the best of intentions sometimes ends in catastrophe.&nbsp;<i>Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong</i>&nbsp;is a highly entertaining and, at times, searing critique of the deeply disputed role of American Indians in the United States. In &#x201c;A Place Called Irony,&#x201d; Smith whizzes through his early life, showing us the ironic pop culture signposts that marked this Native American&#x2019;s coming of age in suburbia: &#x201c;We would order Chinese food and slap a favorite video into the machine&#x2014;the Grammy Awards or a Reagan press conference&#x2014;and argue about Cyndi Lauper or who should coach the Knicks.&#x201d; In &#x201c;Lost in Translation,&#x201d; Smith explores why American Indians are so often misunderstood and misrepresented in today&#x2019;s media: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re lousy television.&#x201d; In &#x201c;Every Picture Tells a Story,&#x201d; Smith remembers his Comanche grandfather as he muses on the images of American Indians as &#x201c;a half-remembered presence, both comforting and dangerous, lurking just below the surface.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Smith walks this tightrope between comforting and dangerous, offering unrepentant skepticism and, ultimately, empathy. &#x201c;This book is called&nbsp;<i>Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong</i>, but it&#x2019;s a book title, folks, not to be taken literally. Of course I don&#x2019;t mean everything, just most things. And &#x2018;you&#x2019; really means we, as in all of us.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul Chaat Smith is associate curator at the Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Museum of the American Indian. He is the coauthor, with Robert Warrior, of <i>Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee</i>.In this acerbic collection of essays, Comanche cultural critic and art curator Smith (<i>Like a Hurricane</i>) riffs on the romantic stereotypes of Indian as spiritual masters and first environmentalists, as tragic victims of technology and civilization, as primal beings brimming with nomad authenticity, their every artifact a gem of folk art. Such tropes, he complains, hide the riotous complexity of the modern Indian experience, which he visits in pieces that explore his grandfather's Christian church, Sitting Bull's savvy manipulation of his media image (he had an agent) and the author's own Comanche forebears, who were both world-class barbarians and avid adopters of the white man's gadgetry. These loose-limbed essays range all over the landscape, from Hollywood westerns to the 1973 siege of Wounded Knee to (somewhat obscurely) the contemporary Indian art scene. Smith doesn't entirely square his view of Indians as just plain folks with his advancing of a unique Indian cultural perspective, but his keen, skeptical eye makes such ironies both amusing and enlightening.

She is also the author of <i>Rolfing and Physical Reality</i>.<b>That Odd Mary Magdalene<br></b> <br>It seems that even among Jesus&#x2019; disciples, Mary played a privileged role. Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>The Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion: Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, No. 18</h2><p>A friend of Carson Drew&#x2019;s has been arrested and charged with sending a truck loaded with explosive oranges into the Space Center complex at Cape Kennedy.

It was lunch hour on Thursday, which meant book talk, crafts and snacks, as their weekly crafternoon book club gathered in a meeting room on the far side of the building.</p><p>Out of all the activities the library hosted, this was by far Lindsey&#x2019;s favorite. She figured it was the book nerd in her that loved it so, but truthfully, these ladies had become her dearest friends since she&#x2019;d moved to Briar Creek, Connecticut, a few years ago, and any afternoon she shared with them was time well spent.</p><p>&#x201c;Lindsey, wait up!&#x201d; a voice called to her from the children&#x2019;s department. She spun around to see an old-fashioned aviator charging toward her.</p><p>Lindsey squinted. Beneath the leather cap and goggles, she couldn&#x2019;t make out much, but she was pretty sure she recognized the upturned nose and stubborn chin as belonging to her children&#x2019;s librarian, Beth Stanley. But it was hard to say, as the rest of her was dressed in a white scarf, leather bomber jacket, black pants and boots. Not the typical wardrobe for a woman who spent most of her time doing finger plays, felt boards and story times.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; the aviator asked. She planted her hands on her hips and stood as if she were posing for a photo.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? Oh!&#x201d; The woman wrestled her goggles up onto her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me&#x2014;Beth. What do you think of my steampunk outfit?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the bomb,&#x201d; Lindsey said with a laugh. Beth looked positively delighted with herself and with good reason. &#x201c;You look like you could have stepped right out of Scott Westerfeld&#x2019;s <i>Leviathan</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; Beth pumped a fist in the air. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I was going for. My teen group worked on these at our meeting last night. You should see some of the stuff they made. We&#x2019;re all getting together at the Blue Anchor tonight to have our holiday blowout and show off our outfits.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love it,&#x201d; Lindsey said. Not for the first time, she thought how lucky the community was to have Beth, who truly brought reading to life for kids and teens.</p><p>&#x201c;I think you look ridiculous,&#x201d; a voice said from the circulation desk. &#x201c;Mr. Tupper never let his staff run around in costume, and certainly not out in public.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one asked you&#x2014;&#x201d; Beth began, but Lindsey cut her off.</p><p>&#x201c;That will do, Ms. Cole,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Beth has done amazing things to get our teens reading.&#x201d;</p><p>Ms. Cole sniffed but didn&#x2019;t argue, which Lindsey felt was a big improvement. Known as the lemon to the rest of the staff, Ms. Cole was an old-school librarian who longed for the days of shushing loud patrons and shunning late borrowers.</p><p>&#x201c;Walk and talk,&#x201d; Lindsey said to Beth. &#x201c;Crafternoon is starting soon, and I need to set up the meeting room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s bringing the food this week?&#x201d; Beth asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nancy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I hope she baked cookies,&#x201d; Beth said. Nancy Peyton, who was also Lindsey&#x2019;s landlord, was known throughout Briar Creek for her exceptional cookie-baking skills. Since it was December and the holidays were just weeks away, Lindsey knew that Nancy had been giving her oven a workout.</p><p>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a safe bet,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>She glanced out the window as they turned down the short hallway that led to the crafternoon room. The town maintenance crew had been decorating the old-fashioned lampposts that lined Main Street with garlands of silver and gold tinsel, and hanging green wreaths with red ribbons just below the lamps.</p><p>The decorations added just the right amount of festive energy to the air and helped ward off the gloom that seemed to be descending upon them in the form of menacing, steel gray clouds, which were reflected by the water in the bay, giving everything a cold, hard and unforgiving appearance.</p><p>The crafternoon room had a small gas fireplace, and Lindsey had a feeling that they were going to need it today to fight off the wintery chill in the air.</p><p>&#x201c;So I was thinking you should come and meet up with me and the teens at the Blue Anchor tonight,&#x201d; Beth said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fun. I even have enough steampunk gear for you to wear.&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey glanced at her friend. She could not picture herself looking like a souped-up Amelia Earhart; still Beth had spray-painted the goggles copper and stuck all sorts of knobs and gear and even a dragonfly on them. They were pretty cool.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like to leave Heathcliff alone for that long,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;What alone?&#x201d; Beth asked. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been mooching cookies off of Nancy all day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No doubt,&#x201d; Lindsey said. Nancy liked to have Lindsey&#x2019;s dog, Heathcliff, with her during the day. &#x201c;Which is why he&#x2019;s going to need an even longer walk than usual tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aw, come on,&#x201d; Beth said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fun. Charlie&#x2019;s band is playing, and who knows? You might run into one of your admirers.&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey gave her a bland look. &#x201c;I have no idea to whom you could be referring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sully or Robbie,&#x201d; Beth said. &#x201c;You know they&#x2019;re both hovering around waiting for you to give any hint of encouragement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you finish the book for this week?&#x201d; Lindsey asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice conversational segue&#x2014;not,&#x201d; Beth said. &#x201c;Yes, I finished <i>The Woman in White</i>, but you didn&#x2019;t answer&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that the novel was so popular that Wilkie Collins had &#x2018;AUTHOR OF &#x201c;THE WOMAN IN WHITE&#x201d;&#x2019;<i> </i>inscribed on his tombstone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fascinating, but you might want to save that tidbit for when the other crafternooners start to grill you about your love life,&#x201d; Beth said.</p><p>Lindsey turned the key in the lock and pushed it open.</p><p>The room was dark, and she flipped the switch to the left of the door before stepping into the room.</p><p>Her gaze moved past the door to where she saw a man standing perfectly still. She felt a thrill of recognition surge through her, but the man shook his head from side to side and then put his finger to his lips. Lindsey knew immediately that he didn&#x2019;t want anyone to know he was there.</p><p>She quickly stepped back out of the room, bumping into Beth as she went.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; Beth asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s freezing in there,&#x201d; Lindsey said. She shivered as if to prove it. &#x201c;Even with the fireplace, there&#x2019;s no way this room will be warm enough to meet in. The heat must have been turned off, or maybe a window was left open. I&#x2019;ll check it out. In the meantime, could you set up one of the other meeting rooms for us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On it,&#x201d; Beth said, and she hustled back down the hallway in the direction of the main library.</p><p>As soon as she was gone, Lindsey opened the door and hurried inside. She quickly shut and locked it behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;Jack!&#x201d; she cried.</p><p>&#x201c;Linds!&#x201d; he said in return.</p><p>The ruggedly handsome man met her halfway across the room with his arms open wide. Lindsey leapt at him, and he caught her in a hug that almost, but not quite, crushed her.</p><p>When he released her, Lindsey stepped back and stared at the face so similar to her own. She had many people in her life whom she considered close friends, but the bond between siblings was one that could not be surpassed.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, brother of mine,&#x201d; she said as she crossed her arms over her chest in a fair imitation of their mother when she was irritated. &#x201c;Start explaining.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Where Lindsey was all long blond curls and a face that was handsome more than pretty, Jack was short-cropped honey-colored curls with a face that was almost too pretty for a man. He had hit the genetic lottery with full lips and rich caramel-colored eyes, and Lindsey thought, not for the first time, how unfair it was. Paired with his muscular shoulders, lean hips and formidable height, Jack could have been a male model as easily as an economist, but where Lindsey&#x2019;s world revolved around words, Jack&#x2019;s passion had always been for numbers.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he asked, raising his hands in the air in a questioning gesture. &#x201c;A brother can&#x2019;t surprise his favorite sister for the holidays?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your only sister, but nice try,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Of course, you can surprise me but why are you hiding in here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hiding? What hiding?&#x201d; he asked. He turned away from her and surveyed the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to keep my arrival on the down low for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What aren&#x2019;t you telling me, Jack?&#x201d; she asked. He could try and fool her all he wanted, but she knew that whenever he was hiding something, he started to pace just like he was doing now.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he said. He crossed over to the bookshelves and then the fireplace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just been doing the usual, you know, solving the business troubles of companies around the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then how come I haven&#x2019;t heard from you in a month, and why didn&#x2019;t you tell me you were coming? Do Mom and Dad know you&#x2019;re here? Where have you been anyway? Last I heard, you were in the Fiji Islands,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh, so many questions.&#x201d; Jack groaned. &#x201c;Can we do the catch-up thing later? Hey, is this a gas fireplace? Can I fire it up? It&#x2019;s chilly in here. I thought maybe I could catch a nap since I had almost no sleep last night.&#x201d; As if to prove his statement, he let out a jaw-popping yawn.</p><p>Lindsey fretted her lower lip between her teeth. There was only one person on the entire earth that she could never say no to, and that was Jack.</p><p>The building policy strictly stated that no one was to be in here without a staff member present, but he did look awfully tired and he was a responsible adult. Surely, Jack, a Cornell-educated economist, would be fine left to his own devices in the meeting room. Besides, she could keep checking on him as needed so she would sort of be in here with him.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I still want an explanation. How did you get in here anyway? Because I know the door was locked.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am a man of many talents,&#x201d; he said in a bogus Houdini voice while waving his hands in the air like a magician.</p><p>&#x201c;You found an unlocked window, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; He dropped his arms, looking deflated. &#x201c;You should really be more careful, Linds. You never know what kind of bad guy might come in and steal all of your precious books.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; Lindsey switched on the gas fireplace, which clicked three times before it ignited.</p><p>Jack launched himself onto the squashy leather couch that faced the fireplace. As he settled in, he looked like a very big cat, finding just the right spot for his nap.</p><p>&#x201c;You know my crafternoon group is supposed to be meeting in here,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;You owe me one for disrupting our meeting so you can have a nap.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack grabbed her hand as she passed by the couch, stopping her from leaving.</p><p>&#x201c;I do owe you one, Linds, more than you know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really good to see you. I&#x2019;ve missed you.&#x201d;</p><p>She could see the sincerity in his eyes, and she knew he felt the same way she did. The bond they shared, like an invisible cord, stretched as far as the globe could take them away from each other, but it never broke. They were always connected.</p><p>Lindsey bent down and kissed his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve missed you, too, you big dope. We&#x2019;ll talk, and I mean that, when you wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>She checked her watch. She was going to be late for crafternoon, but that was okay. Her brother Jack was here, and suddenly the steely gray day outside seemed brimming with holiday cheer.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t wait to spend some time with him and hear his latest adventures. Jack was like a crusty old penny with a heavy patina; he had lots of miles and lots of stories on him, and he always turned up when she least expected it.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Woman in White </i>was not what I expected,&#x201d; Nancy Peyton said while she arranged a tray of cookies on the end of the table. &#x201c;Why do novels written in the eighteen hundreds always break up the happy couple? It&#x2019;s annoying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Violet La Rue said. &#x201c;It seems to me many novels separate the couple, especially if it&#x2019;s a series. I suppose we readers just have to read on, trusting the author and being committed to seeing it through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not unlike most relationships,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;I suppose you have to decide if you&#x2019;re the committing type before you start a book, which if you think about it, is a relationship of sorts.&#x201d;</p><p>To Lindsey&#x2019;s relief, today&#x2019;s crafternoon actually worked out better in the smaller glassed-in conference room. Since they were recycling candles and were using little electric hot plates to do it, they had more access to outlets in the refurbished conference room than they would have had in the room she&#x2019;d left to Jack.</p><p>&#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t answer the question,&#x201d; Mary Murphy agreed. She added a bunch of half-spent candles to the pile in the center of the table. Then she looked pointedly at Lindsey and asked, &#x201c;<i>Why</i> does the happy couple always break up?&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey shook her head. Captain Mike Sullivan, known to everyone one as Sully, was Mary Murphy&#x2019;s older brother, and Lindsey knew Mary well enough to know that she was asking why she and Sully were still broken up. Mary never missed an opportunity to fish for information, and since they both belonged to the library&#x2019;s crafternoon group, Mary always used it to work in an informal questioning, which felt like an inquisition, into the status of Lindsey&#x2019;s relationship with Sully.</p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s more dramatic that way,&#x201d; Charlene La Rue answered for Lindsey. &#x201c;Right, Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>Charlene La Rue turned to her mother, Violet, a former Broadway actress and the reigning queen of the local community theater.</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Violet agreed. &#x201c;The story would be over in twenty pages if Walter Hartwright won Laura Fairlie when they first met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the fact that he&#x2019;s her poor drawing instructor makes it so much more romantic,&#x201d; Beth cried.</p><p>Nancy snorted. &#x201c;My grandmother always said, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s just as easy to love a rich man as a poor one.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; Beth agreed. She was still wearing her steampunk cap and goggles, but had taken off the jacket and scarf. &#x201c;But it just seems like there are so many more poor ones to choose from. You know, the unemployed, underachieving, living in his parents&#x2019; basement population has really exploded.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And thus, we remain single,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>&#x201c;An actor is not unemployed,&#x201d; Violet said. &#x201c;Their job prospects are just more eclectic than most.&#x201d;</p><p>Both Violet and Charlene hit Lindsey with their matching mother and daughter dazzling smiles. While Violet was retired from the stage and lived in Briar Creek, Charlene was a newscaster on the local station in New Haven. Both women were tall and thin with rich cocoa skin and warm brown eyes. Together they were a force to be reckoned with, but Lindsey was wise to their game.</p><p>The La Rue women were close friends with Robbie Vine, a famous British actor who had recently come to Briar Creek to star in a production of Violet&#x2019;s while getting reacquainted with his son. He had made no secret of his interest in Lindsey, but even though Robbie charmed her senseless, her heart was still knotted up over Sully, who had dumped her to give her space she had not requested. In a word, it was complicated.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Pffthbt</i>.&#x201d; Beth made a scoffing noise. &#x201c;You know, instead of pushing the head librarian with two beaus to make her choice&#x2014;yes, I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s brutal, Lindsey, really&#x2014;you all might consider canvassing the area for an availab...</p></p><h2>The Omni-Americans: Some Alternatives to the Folklore of White Supremacy</h2><p><b>Rediscover the "most important book on black-white relationships" in America in a special 50th anniversary edition introduced by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b><br><br>"The United States is in actuality not a nation of black people and white people. It is a nation of multicolored people. . . . Any fool can see that the white people are not really white, and that black people are not black. They are all interrelated one way or another." These words, written by Albert Murray at the height of the Black Power movement, cut against the grain of their moment, and announced the arrival of a major new force in American letters. In his 1970 classic <i>The Omni-Americans</i>, Murray took aim at protest writers and social scientists who accentuated the "pathology" of race in American life. Against narratives of marginalization and victimhood, Murray argued that black art and culture, particularly jazz and blues, stand at the very headwaters of the American mainstream, and that much of what is best in American art embodies the "blues-hero tradition"--a heritage of grace, wit, and inspired improvisation in the face of adversity. Reviewing <i>The Omni-Americans</i> in 1970, Walker Percy called it "the most important book on black-white relationships . . . indeed on American culture . . . published in this generation." As Henry Louis Gates, Jr. makes clear in his introduction, Murray's singular poetic voice, impassioned argumentation, and pluralistic vision have only become more urgently needed today.</p><p><b>Albert Lee Murray</b> (1916-2013) was born in Alabama and graduated from Tuskegee Institute with a B.S. in Education in 1939, later earning an M.A. in literature from New York University in 1948.

In the wake of materialism and social change, man had been described in the early years of our century as the &#x201c;dead end&#x201d; of nature. Freud had redefined culture as illness&#x2014;a result of drive sublimation; Klages had called the spirit (and he was surely speaking of the hypertrophied intellect) the &#x201c;adversary of the soul,&#x201d; propounding a return to a life like that of the Pelasgi, the aboriginal inhabitants of Greece; and Spengler had declared the &#x201c;Demise of the West&#x201d; during the years following World War I. The consequences of such pessimism continued to proliferate long after its foundations had been superseded.<br><br>It was with these foundations&#x2014;the natural sciences&#x2014;that Gebser began. As early as Planck it was known that matter was not at all what materialists had believed it to be, and since 1943 Gebser has repeatedly emphasized that the so-called crisis of Western culture was in fact an essential restructuration....<br><br>Gebser has noted two results that are of particular significance: first, the abandonment of materialistic determinism, of a one-sided mechanistic-causal mode of thought; and second, a manifest &#x201c;urgency of attempts to discover a universal way of observing things, and to overcome the inner division of contemporary man who, as a result of his one-sided rational orientation, thinks only in dualisms.&#x201d;<br><br>Against this background of recent discoveries and conclusions in the natural sciences Gebser discerned the outlines of a potential human universality. He also sensed the necessity to go beyond the confines of this first treatise so as to include the humanities (such as political economics and sociology) as well as the arts in a discussion along similar lines. This was the point of departure of <i>The Ever-Present Origin.</i><br><br>From <i>In memoriam Jean Gebser</i> by Jean Keckeis</p></p><p><p><b>Jean Gebser</b> (1905&#x2013;1973) was lecturer at the Institute of Applied Psychology in Z�rich and honorary Professor of Comparative Studies of Civilization at the University of Salzburg.

Under the guidance of these ancient visitors from the heavens, human civilisation flourished - as revolutionary advances in art, science and thought swept through the inhabited world. And they left behind magnificent monuments -- baffling monoliths and awesome, towering structures that stand to this day as testaments to their greatness. </p><p>In this extraordinarily documented, meticulously researched work, Zecharia Sitchin draws remarkable correlations between the events that shape our civilisation in millennia past - pinpointing with astonishing accuracy the tumultuous beginning of time as we know it . . . and revealing to us the indisputable signature of extraterrestrial god indelibly written in stone.</p></p><p>Dear Reader, <br> <br><em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series is based on the premise that mythology is the depository of ancient recollections, that the Bible should be read literally as a historic-scientific document, and that ancient civilizations were the product of knowledge brought to Earth by the Anunnaki--&#x201c;Those who from Heaven to Earth came.&#x201d; <br> <br>Complementing each other and serving to bring the saga of gods and humans on Earth ever closer to our time, each book of the series looks at this awesome tale from a different perspective. <br> <br><em>The 12th Planet</em>, the first book of the series, brings to life the Sumerian civilization and presents millennia-old evidence of the existence of Nibiru, the home planet of the Anunnaki, and the landings of the Anunnaki on Earth every 3,600 years. <br> <br><em>The Stairway to Heaven</em>, the second book, incorporates ancient Egyptian evidence to show that the gateway between the mortal and the divine was a spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula, with the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx serving as beacons for the landings. <br> <br><em>The Wars of Gods and Men</em>, the third book, additionally embraces Canaanite, Hittite, and Hindu sources to include in these investigations the incidents of the Tower of Babel and the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah, concluding that nuclear weapons were used on Earth 4,000 years ago. <br> <br> <em>The Lost Realms</em>, the fourth book, transports readers to the pre-Columbian civilizations and ancient empires of the Americas, revealing hitherto unrecognized golden links between ancient Near Eastern civilizations and the "cities of the gods" of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs, and Incas. <br> <br><em>When Time Began</em>, the fifth book, explores ancient knowledge of Heaven and Earth and the interwoven cycles that gave rise to astronomy, the zodiac and astrology, and stone calendars such as Stonehenge, revealing the secret of New Ages past and future. <br> <br>And <em>The Cosmic Code</em>, the sixth book in the series, explains how the secrets of humankind&#x2019;s celestial teachers were encoded in the Bible and other sacred and hidden &#x201c;books&#x201d;--a cosmic code that links Earthlings to their cosmic roots. <br> <br>In the years since each book was published, new scientific discoveries have provided mounting corroboration of the series&#x2019; incredible and unorthodox science-based conclusions. This accumulation of discoveries and the origins of humankind and the solar system are further discussed in the companion books <em>Genesis Revisited</em> and <em>Divine Encounters</em>. I trust that modern science will continue to confirm ancient knowledge. <br> <br>Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) was born in Russia and grew up in Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. A graduate of the University of London with a degree in economic history, he worked as a journalist and editor for many years prior to undertaking his life&#x2019;s work--<em>The Earth Chronicles</em>. <br> <br>One of the few scholars able to read the clay tablets and interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian, Sitchin based <em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series on the texts and pictorial evidence recorded by the ancient civilizations of the Near East. His books have been widely translated, reprinted in paperback editions, converted to Braille for the blind, and featured on radio and television programs. <br>ARCHAEOLOGY / HISTORY <br> <br>Special large-format edition, lavishly illustrated with maps, diagrams, and photographs <br> <br>Night and day, month after month, year after year, our ancestors dutifully recorded the passage of time on clay tablets, watching the heavens from stage towers and pyramids and from megalithic monuments whose incredible size and precise architecture boggle the mind. . . . Who were the builders of these mysterious structures? What was their purpose? Whose signature is indelibly written on these timeless stones, and who was the Divine Architect? Why was Stonehenge and its likes built by ancient civilizations at the very same time--4,100 years ago? What is their message for our time? With these questions in mind, Zecharia Sitchin, renowned researcher of past ages, takes us on a journey through the records of time in this, the fifth book of his <em>Earth Chronicles</em> series. Drawing deeply on Sumerian and Egyptian writings, millenia-old artifacts, and sacred architecture ranging from ancient Mesopotamia to pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, this bestselling scholar provides astounding insights into the origins of the calendar, astronomy, and astrology. He takes readers to the climax circa 2100 b.c. when Marduk, the Babylonian national god, attained supremacy on Earth and proclaimed the New Age of Aries--after which society, religion, science, and the status of women were never the same. <br> <br>&#x201c;Compelling.&#x201d; <br>--<em>Booklist </em> <br> <br>&#x201c;Sitchin&#x2019;s book is nothing less than a sensation. . . . a sober and erudite work, profound in its implications and obviously the outcome of painstaking, perceptive research into the texts of past ages. As such, it is sincere and convincing.&#x201d; <br>--<em>Worcester Evening News</em></p><h2>I Am Not Myself These Days: A Memoir</h2><p><p> <i>I Am Not Myself These Days </i>follows a glittering journey through Manhattan's dark underbelly - a shocking and surreal world where alter egos reign and subsist (barely) on dark wit and chemicals. . . a tragic romantic comedy where one begins by rooting for the survival of the relationship and ends by hoping someone simply survives. Kilmer-Purcell is a terrifically gifted new literary voice who straddles the divide between absurdity and normalcy, and stitches them together with surprising humor and lonely poignancy. As Booklist raved "as tart and funny as a Noel Coward play, for Kilmer-Purcell is especially good at dialogue, and, as in Coward's best plays, under the comedy lies the sad truth that even at our best, we are all weak, fallible fools. Again and again in this rich, adventure-filled book, Kilmer-Purcell illustrates the truth of Blake's proverb, 'The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.'" </p></p><p><i>I Am Not Myself These Days</i> is Josh Kilmer-Purcell's outrageously intimate memoir of a young man living a double life in the heady days and nights of mid-'90s New York City. As we follow Kilmer-Purcell through alcohol-fueled nights and a love affair with Jack, a crack-addicted male escort, he offers up an alternative universe where normal is "a Normal Rockwell painting that, if you leaned in close, would discover is made up entirely of misfits." <p> By day, Josh drudges off to a Soho-based advertising firm where he creates ad campaigns for corporate clients. At night, he dons live goldfish to complete the look of Aqua, a 7-foot-tall award-winning drag queen who trolls gay clubs in search of her next drink/one night stand. In between, he spends his time trying to build a stable, loving relationship with someone whose beeping pager is a constant reminder of the pair's almost inevitable fate. Yet even as Josh's escapades get increasingly absurd, Kilmer-Purcell is always there to remind us that the story we're reading is real, and that fundamental human emotions and desires are essentially universal. In the end, everyone just wants to be loved and to fit in somewhere. And while the lesson may seem hokey at times, Kilmer-Purcell's sharp wit rescues the memoir from becoming an exaggerated sob story: </p><blockquote> The night before any major holiday is always a blockbuster night at gay clubs. Thousands... across the city fortifying themselves for long trips home where they'll be met with awkward silences, stilted conversations and cousins with whom they'd experimented with decades ago. </blockquote> From start to finish, <i>I Am Not Myself These Days</i> is an extraordinary journey into an amazing life. To be a fly on the wall is an adventure that should not be missed. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i><p>Josh Kilmer-Purcell is the bestselling author of the memoir <em>I Am Not Myself These Days</em> and the novel <em>Candy Everybody Wants</em>, and the star of Planet Green's documentary television series <em>The Fabulous Beekman Boys</em>.

A passionate Anglophile, he was a great expert on all things English, including its medieval history, which provides great inspiration for the series. His many and diverse fans include George RR Martin, Nicolas Sarkozy and Vladimir Putin.</p>*Starred Review* Sporting an enthusiastic introduction by George R. R. Martin (in which he calls the book &#x201c;the original game of thrones&#x201d;), this is the first U.S. publication of the first volume of French novelist Druon&#x2019;s seven-volume historical saga, collectively known as The Accursed Kings. Originally published in 1955, the novel is set in the year 1314. Philip IV, the king of France, has disbanded the Knights Templar, arresting, torturing, and executing most of them. Relations between France and England are as strained as they have ever been. Philip&#x2019;s increasingly desperate search for money to pay his massive debts has virtually bankrupted the country. Against this sprawling backdrop, Druon tells the story of Robert of Artois, a French lord whose lands have been taken from him by his greedy aunt and whose efforts to reclaim his birthright will lead to all-out war between France and England. Unlike Martin&#x2019;s multivolume Song of Fire and Ice, Druon&#x2019;s saga is based on real history and features real people as its central characters. It&#x2019;s historical fiction on a grand scale, full of political intrigue, family drama, and characters who, while drawn from life, are larger than it. Fans of historical epics who have not yet discovered Druon&#x2019;s saga will be thrilled with this one. --David Pitt</p><h2>Sacagawea: American Pathfinder (Childhood Of Famous Americans)</h2><p>Describes how Sacagawea found adventure guiding Lewis and Clark to the Oregon coast.</p><p>Flora Warren Seymour (1888&#x2013;1948) was an attorney and writer who was the first woman member of the Board of Indian Commissioners.

I didn't know that if a girl broke your heart, another girl, virtuous at least in spirit, could mend it on the same night. And I didn't know that the enthalpy decrease in a converging passage could be transformed into jet kinetic energy if a divergent passage was added. The other boys discovered their own truths when we built our rockets, but those were mine."<br><br>So begins Homer "Sonny" Hickam Jr.'s extraordinary memoir of life in Coalwood, West Virginia-a hard-scrabble little company town where the only things that mattered were coal mining and high school football. But in 1957, after the Soviet satellite Sputnik shot across the Appalachian sky, Sonny and his teenaged friends decided to do their bit for the U.S. space race by building their own rockets&#x2014;and Coalwood, Sonny and A powerful story of growing up and of getting out, of a mother's love and a father's fears, Homer Hickam's memoir <b>Rocket Boys</b> proves, like <i>Angela's Ashes</i> and Russell Baker's <i>Growing Up</i> before it, that the right storyteller and the right story can touch readers' hearts and enchant their souls.<br><br>In a town where the only things that mattered were coal-mining and high-school football, where the future was regarded with more fear than hope, a young man watched the Soviet satellite <i>Sputnik</i> race across the West Virginia sky&#x2014;and soon found his future in the stars. In 1957, Homer H. "Sonny" Hickam, Jr., and a handful of his friends were inspired to start designing and launching the home-made rockets that would change their lives and their town forever.<br><br>Looking back after a distinguished NASA career, Hickam shares the story of his youth, taking readers into the life of the little mining town of Coalwood and the boys who would come to embody its dreams. Step by step, with the help (and occasional hindrance) of a collection of unforgettable characters, the boys learn not only how to turn scrap into sophisticated rockets that fly miles into the sky, but how to sustain their dreams as they dared to imagine a life beyond its borders in a town that the postwar boom was passing by.<br><br><b>Rocket Boys</b> has already caught the eye of Hollywood: The producer of <i>Field of Dreams</i> is now working to produce a major motion picture in time for next year's Academy Awards.<br><br>A uniquely endearing story with universal themes of class, family, coming of age, and the thrill of discovery, Homer Hickam's <b>Rocket Boys</b> is evocative, vivid storytelling at its most magical.</p><p>Inspired by Werner von Braun and his Cape Canaveral team, 14-year-old Homer Hickam decided in 1957 to build his own rockets. They were his ticket out of Coalwood, West Virginia, a mining town that everyone knew was dying--everyone except Sonny's father, the mine superintendent and a company man so dedicated that his family rarely saw him. Hickam's smart, iconoclastic mother wanted her son to become something more than a miner and, along with a female science teacher, encouraged the efforts of his grandiosely named Big Creek Missile Agency. He grew up to be a NASA engineer and his memoir of the bumpy ride toward a gold medal at the National Science Fair in 1960--an unprecedented honor for a miner's kid--is rich in humor as well as warm sentiment. Hickam vividly evokes a world of close communal ties in which a storekeeper who sold him saltpeter warned, "Listen, rocket boy. This stuff can blow you to kingdom come." Hickam is candid about the deep disagreements and tensions in his parents' marriage, even as he movingly depicts their quiet loyalty to each other. The portrait of his ultimately successful campaign to win his aloof father's respect is equally affecting. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[T]horoughly charming....Hickam builds a story of overcoming obstacles that is worthy of Frank Capra...[in its]...eloquent evocation of a lost time and place."<br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Rights of Man (Dover Thrift Editions: Political Science)</h2><p><p>One of the most influential writers and reformers of his age, Thomas Paine successfully publicized the issues of his time in pamphlets that clearly and persuasively argued for political independence and social reform. <i>Rights of Man</i>, his greatest and most widely read work, is considered a classic statement of faith in democracy and egalitarianism.<br>The first part of this document, dedicated to George Washington, appeared in 1791<b>.</b> Defending the early events of the French Revolution, it spoke on behalf of democracy, equality, and a new European order.

Part Two, which appeared the following year, is perhaps Paine's finest example of political pamphleteering and an exemplary work that supported social security for workers, public employment for those in need of work, abolition of laws limiting wages, and other social reforms.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Knife Slipped (Cool and Lam)</h2><p>Lost for more than 75 years,&nbsp;<i>The Knife Slipped&nbsp;</i>was meant to be the second book in the series, but shelved when Gardner&#x2019;s publisher objected to (among other things) Bertha Cool&#x2019;s tendency to &#x201c;talk tough, swear, smoke cigarettes, and try to gyp people.&#x201d; But this tale of adultery and corruption, of double-crosses and triple identities&#x2014;however shocking for 1939&#x2014;shines today as a glorious present from the past, a return to the heyday of private eyes and shady dames, of powerful criminals, crooked cops, blazing dialogue, and delicious plot twists.&nbsp;<br><br>Donald Lam has never been cooler&#x2014;not even when played by Frank Sinatra on the&nbsp;<i>U.S. Steel Hour of Mystery&nbsp;</i>in 1946.

The crime stunned and paralyzed France since Louis had often ruled in place of his brother King Charles, who had gone mad. As panic seized Paris, an investigation began. In charge was the Provost of Paris, Guillaume de Tignonville, the city's chief law enforcement officer--and one of history's first detectives. As de Tignonville began to investigate, he realized that his hunt for the truth was much more dangerous than he ever could have imagined.<br><br>A rich portrait of a distant world, BLOOD ROYAL is a gripping story of conspiracy, crime and an increasingly desperate hunt for the truth. And in Guillaume de Tignonville, we have an unforgettable detective for the ages, a classic gumshoe for a cobblestoned era.</p><p>Eric Jager is an award-winning professor at UCLA and the author of many in acclaimed academic journals. He has also written three books, including the widely acclaimed<i> The Last Duel</i>, <i>The Book of the Heart,</i> and <i>The Tempter's Voice</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.On a November evening in 1407, Louis of Orleans, brother of the mentally unbalanced French king Charles VI, was bludgeoned and stabbed to death on a Parisian street by several masked men. This was no simple street mugging. Louis had exercised great power during his brother&#x2019;s frequent bouts of incapacitation. With France still embroiled in the Hundred Years&#x2019; War with England and facing severe internal threats to the monarchy, the murder had far-reaching implications. To unravel the assassination plot, Guillaume de Tigonville, the chief law enforcement officer of Paris, had to wade through the layers of criminality, corruption, and high politics that permeated different levels of French society. Jager has utilized de Tigonville&#x2019;s written report as the basis for a tense and exciting true-life detective story. De Tigonville is the ideal detective, combining street smarts, a relentless drive, and a willingness to follow where the facts lead regardless of whose toes he steps on. An outstanding crime tale that also provides a good survey of both the glittering facade and the seamier aspects of medieval Paris. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Sir Bentley and Holbrook Court (The Knights of Arrethtrae)</h2><p>Sir Bentley, an honorable young knight, abandons his calling in order to seek the truth of the Prince.

Sand-colored hair formed loose curls around the young man&#x2019;s neck and ears. His square, clean shaven jaw revealed a small, faint scar&#x2014;a badge to remind him never to become prideful about his considerable abilities as a swordsman. Bentley&#x2019;s shoulders were broad, and he carried himself with the distinctive posture of a nobleman. In spite of his comely appearance and his social charm, however, Bentley did not hold himself in high regard, and thus there was very little to dislike about the young man.<br>&#x201c;Do you swear to uphold the honor of the Noble Knights, placing the protection of your fellow brothers- in-arms above your own?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; Bentley replied.<br>Nearly all two hundred Noble Knights were present to witness the knighting of one more squire into their brotherhood. It was a time-honored tradition that often followed the family lines of the wealthiest men in Chessington, and such was the case with Bentley. Behind the Noble Knights stood two to three hundred highly respected citizens of Chessington, for this was a significant event for both the Noble Knights and the citizenry.<br>&#x201c;Do you take this oath without reservation, fully understanding the authority and responsibilities granted to you by the King&#x2014;an oath that binds you to the order of the Noble Knights until death?&#x201d;<br>Bentley hesitated, looking past Kifus toward the two men standing behind him. His father, Sir Barrington, and Sir York, the man who trained him at sword&#x2014;his role model and his mentor. Could any two men be more different?<br>Bentley looked toward York and then to his father. A few seconds passed, and the delay became awkward. Barrington gazed at his son, smiled, and nodded. The room filled with tension, and Kifus&#x2019;s gaze<br>became stone hard.<br>Bentley looked back to the white-haired knightly leader, an icon of the perfect knight in many eyes. This was what Bentley had wanted his whole life, and yet something tugged upon his soul from another direction. It was those last few words that caused him to hesitate, for such an oath was a seal that would establish the course of his life forever.<br>He repeated the words in his mind:<br><i>&#x201c;Do you take this oath without reservation...an oath that binds you to the order of the Noble Knights until death?&#x201d;<br></i>What could be more honorable than service to the King?<br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; Bentley lowered his head in submission.<br>As if the doors of a flooded chamber had opened, the tension abated. Kifus lifted his brilliant silver sword to just above Bentley&#x2019;s shoulder.<br>&#x201c;Then I dub thee Sir Bentley, protector of Chessington and Noble Knight of the King!&#x201d;<br>He touched the flat of the blade to each of Bentley&#x2019;s shoulders, and a roar of shouts and acclamation filled the great hall. Bentley stood and Kifus offered his arm as a token of brotherhood.<br>&#x201c;Well done, Sir Bentley. You are young but well deserving of the honor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Lord Kifus.&#x201d;<br>Kifus turned to greet some of the approaching prestigious knights and citizens. Bentley&#x2019;s father stepped forward and embraced his son.<br>&#x201c;I am proud of you, my son.&#x201d; Barrington smiled broadly through his cropped salt-and-pepper beard.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Father. You and you alone have been my inspiration.&#x201d; York stepped forward and grasped Bentley&#x2019;s arm.<br>&#x201c;<i>Sir Bentley</i>...has a nice ring to it, aye, laddie?&#x201d; He slapped Bentley hard on the shoulder with a meaty palm.<br>Bentley bowed his head toward York. &#x201c;I am indebted to you for all the training you have given me, sir.&#x201d;<br>York&#x2019;s smile vanished as his mind seemed to return to a former preoccupation. &#x201c;Aye, and ye&#x2019;ll be needing those skills in the days to come. The Followers continue to be a menace to our cause, and Kifus tells me our missions to eradicate them will increase.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Bentley replied, but something in his heart resisted the words. &#x201c;What was it like before?&#x201d;<br>York squinted and cocked his head to one side. &#x201c;Before the...ah...Followers?&#x201d; Bentley added. It was an unusual question, and it conveyed much more than curiosity. Those few words carried a subtle message that raised the eyebrows of both York and his father.<br>York looked back and forth between Barrington and Bentley.When he spoke, his words vibrated with passion. &#x201c;It was a time when the authority of the Noble Knights was never questioned! That&#x2019;s why we<br>must fight well in coming days. The lingering effects of that dead Stranger will end, and we will restore the order of the Noble Knights to its rightful place when we eradicate His imbecile Followers.&#x201d; York&#x2019;s<br>countenance had assumed a familiar ferocity, his eyes beneath their bushy black brows seemed to shoot forth fiery darts.<br>Neither Bentley nor his father said a word. It was exactly the response Bentley had expected, and he wasn&#x2019;t sure why he had even asked the question. The momentary awkward silence between them<br>ended when his mother took his arm and a dozen other knights and citizens moved in to offer congratulations.<br>When the knighting ceremony was over and the accolades were finished, Bentley lingered behind in the great hall. It was a day he had looked forward to for a long time. He took a deep breath and tried to<br>enjoy the moment. It felt good to be a Noble Knight...almost perfect.<br>Almost.<br>Bentley&#x2019;s heart pounded hard in his chest. He readied his sword in a midguard stance as he stood face to face with a fierce warrior whose markings Bentley had never seen before.The warrior yelled and initiated a diagonal cut that nearly blew Bentley&#x2019;s sword from his grip. Preoccupied with his own survival, he was barely conscious of the clanging of other swords nearby.<br>He tightened his grip and countered with a rising cut, followed by a horizontal slice. His sword was met by the nearly immovable dark blade of the warrior, and he had to retreat to avoid the next deadly slice.<br>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw one of his fellow Noble Knights fall to the ground&#x2014;and realized that he, York, and his other five companions could shortly succumb to the same fate. The five warriors they<br>faced were much more than mere marauders; they had the look of seasoned war veterans. The Noble Knights had the advantage in numbers only, for the skill and power of these men far surpassed anything they had ever experienced.<br>Bentley considered his next move. How could they have made such a serious miscalculation and come to such a desperate situation? The months following his knighting ceremony had been filled with raids on the Followers, but each week seemed more intense than the previous. This was already their third mission this week.<br>They had received news from an informant that a handful of Followers was meeting near a hut in the hollow at the northwest edge of Chessington.When they arrived, a strange old woman had yelled at them and cursed them from afar. York had ignored her and insisted they search the hut and the surrounding area. When they dismounted and neared the hut, these five massive warriors had attacked. Bentley had barely been able to draw his sword in time before one warrior launched a deadly slice toward him. Ever since, he had been fighting for his life.<br>Another powerful slice came terrifyingly close, and Bentley ducked. He heard the <i>swoosh </i>of his enemy&#x2019;s blade pass just above his head. Bentley initiated another rising cut, but missed and found himself slightly off balance. He knew that such an experienced man of war would capitalize on Bentley&#x2019;s mistake&#x2014;and he did. The next slice came from Bentley&#x2019;s left, and he was only able to raise his sword for partial protection before the grisly blade blasted through his defense.<br>The concussion on his sword carried on to Bentley&#x2019;s left spaulder and slammed into his helmet. Bentley careened to the right, scrambling in vain to keep his footing, then crashed to the ground.<br>He knew what would happen next. In seconds, he would feel the steel of his enemy&#x2019;s sword pierce his armor and then his chest. He lifted his sword for protection against the vertical slice, but the edge of the<br>warrior&#x2019;s blade burst through his resistance and into his breastplate. The impact of the blow on his body seemed to force the last of his strength from him. His end was near.<br>Bentley froze as the warrior lifted his sword high above him for a final downward thrust.His physical exhaustion did not diminish his fear of death in the least. But just as the tip of the warrior&#x2019;s sword began its plummet, Bentley heard an unfamiliar yell and watched a wide arcing blade slice across his enemy&#x2019;s torso from behind.<br>Screaming in pain and frustration, the warrior recoiled and turned on his unknown assailant. Bentley&#x2019;s strength immediately returned, and he rolled away, quickly finding his feet. The warrior was now heavily<br>engaged with a new adversary, one Bentley had never seen before.<br>Bentley chanced a quick glance about him and realized that four other knights had joined their cause against these massive warriors of destruction. Another glance filled him with shock as he recognized their insignia.<br><i>Followers!<br></i>The newcomers bore the unmistakable mark of the Stranger. This was the enemy Bentley and his comrades had set out that morning to engage. Yet these men were fighting to save their lives.<br>Bentley brought his sword to bear along with his unexpected ally against the dark warrior, who was now wounded and searching for an avenue of retreat.Together, they forced the warrior into flight and joined<br>the remaining knights in vanquishing their foes.<br>When the tips of the swords slowly settled to grassy harbors of rest, only one man had fallen. Bentley and anotherNoble Knight went to him and began removing his breastplate, for the wound was serious.The other men stood breathing heavily as the rush within their bodies subsided.<br>Bentley looked up in gratitude toward the man who had wielded sword to help him. &#x201c;Thank you for your help. We&#x2019;ve never faced such men before.&#x201d;<br>The Follower nodded in the direction the enemy had fled. &#x201c;We have. They are enemies of the King.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As are ye,&#x201d; came York&#x2019;s voice from behind. &#x201c;Drop yer swords.&#x201d;<br>Bentley looked up incredulously. &#x201c;But these men&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;&#x2014;are our enemies,&#x201d; York repeated. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be imprisoned.&#x201d;<br>The four Followers looked stunned, then slowly stepped back and away once they determined the burly knight was not bluffing.<br>Bentley jumped to his feet. &#x201c;They just saved our lives!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then they be fools as well,&#x201d; York spat. &#x201c;Disarm them!&#x201d;<br>The other knights looked at one another and then at Bentley. Bentley met their eyes, then knelt back down to his fallen comrade.The delay allowed the Followers to separate themselves, and they ran into the trees of the valley.<br>&#x201c;After them!&#x201d; York commanded.<br>&#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; one of the older knights exclaimed. &#x201c;Nordan is down and needs immediate treatment.We either help him, or we chase the Followers and let him die&#x2014;you choose!&#x201d;<br>York&#x2019;s eyes burned with fury, and in that moment Bentley fully discerned how deep York&#x2019;s contention with the Followers lay.<br>It was a moment that set his mind on a different course.</p><h2>Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings from the Road</h2><p><p>In <em>Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die</em>, Willie Nelson muses about his greatest influences and the things that are most important to him, and celebrates the family, friends, and colleagues who have blessed his remarkable journey.

He lives in Archer City, Texas.<b>Chapter 1</b><br>On their monthly visits to the prison, Aurora drove going and Rosie drove home. That was the tradition, and there was good reason for it: seeing her grandson behind bars, being reminded yet again that he had killed a woman, realizing that in all likelihood she would be seeing him only in such circumstances for the rest of her life, left Aurora far too shaken to be trusted at the wheel of a car -- particularly the sputtery old Cadillac she refused to trade in. Aurora managed the Cadillac erratically under the best of circumstances, and visiting Tommy in prison could not be called the best of circumstances.<br>Rosie and everyone else who knew Aurora felt sure the Cadillac would be the death of her someday, but it would not have been wise to reiterate this fear on the return trip from Huntsville, when Aurora would have been only too happy to die on the spot.<br>Aurora, in the midst of a bitter fit of sobbing, nonetheless reached up and twisted the rearview mirror her way, in order to regard her own despair. It was an old habit: when sorrow beset her, as it now did regularly, she often grabbed the nearest mirror, hoping, through vanity alone, to arrest it in its course before it did her too much damage.<br>This time it didn't work, not merely because she was crying so hard she couldn't see herself at all, but because Rosie -- a woman so short she could barely see the traffic in front of her, much less that which she knew to be in pursuit, immediately grabbed the mirror and twisted it back.<br>"Don't do that, hon, I got to have my mirror!" Rosie said, panicked because she heard the sound of a huge truck bearing down on them, but lacked a clue as to exactly how close it might be.<br>"There's an eighteen-wheeler after us -- if that sucker ran over us we'd be squished like soup in a can," she added, wishing they were in Conroe, so perhaps Aurora would quit crying, shaking, and scattering wet Kleenex around.<br>The prison where Tommy was doing fifteen years to life was in Huntsville, Texas. Conroe, Texas, thirty-two miles to the south, down an Interstate rife with eighteen-wheelers, was the nearest point at which Aurora could reasonably be expected to regain control of her emotions. Until then, all Rosie could do was stay out of the fast lane and drive for dear life.<br>"I just wish you'd do something I ask you for once in your life and buy us a Datsun pickup," Rosie said. "We'd stand a lot better chance on this racetrack if we had a vehicle I could see out of."<br>To her relief she noticed the eighteen-wheeler sliding smoothly past them on her left.<br>Aurora didn't respond. Her mind was back with Tommy, the pale, calm boy in the prison. He had always been the brightest of her dead daughter's three children. His grades had never been less than excellent, unlike those of her other grandchildren, Teddy and Melanie, both such erratic scholars that it was hardly even fair to use the word "scholar" when referring to their academic careers.<br>"We're almost to Conroe," Rosie said unwisely, hoping it might cause Aurora to stop crying a little sooner than usual.<br>"Who gives a fuck where we are!" Aurora yelled, flaring up for a moment before crying a fresh flood.<br>Rosie was so shocked she almost rear-ended a white Toyota suburban. Only three or four times in their long acquaintance had she heard her employer use that particular word.<br>Shortly after they sped past the first Conroe exit, Aurora calmed a little.<br>"Rosie, I'm not a robot," she said. "I do not have to stop crying just because we happen to be passing Conroe."<br>"I wish I hadn't brought it up," Rosie said. "I wish I hadn't never been born. But most of all I wish we had a Datsun pickup -- the seat of this car is so old it's sinking in, and if it sinks in much farther I won't be able to see anything but the speedometer. Then an eighteen-wheeler will probably run over us and squish us like soup in a can."<br>"This car is not a can and we will not be squished like soup," Aurora declared, sniffing. "You've chosen a bad figure."<br>"Yeah, I was always flat-chested, but I didn't choose it, God did it to me," Rosie said, thinking it odd that Aurora would mention her lifelong flat-chestedness at such a time.<br>"Oh, figure of speech, I meant," Aurora said. "Of course you didn't choose your bosom. What I meant to point out is that there's nothing souplike about either one of us. If you get squished, it'll be like a French fry, which is what you resemble."<br>Aurora felt no better, but she did feel cried out, and she began to mop her cheeks with a wad of Kleenex. She had already scattered several wet wads on the seat. She gathered these up, compressed them into one sopping mess, and threw the mess out the window.<br>"Hon, you oughtn't to litter," Rosie admonished. "There's signs all up and down this highway saying don't mess with Texas."<br>"I'll mess with it all I want to," Aurora said. "It's certainly messed enough with me."<br>When her vision cleared a bit more, she noticed that a stream of cars and trucks was flowing past them. Looking back, she saw with alarm that a very large truck seemed to be practically pushing them.<br>"Rosie, are you going the correct speed?" she asked. "We're not exactly leading the pack."<br>"I'm going fifty-five," Rosie said.<br>"Then no wonder that truck just behind us has such an impatient aspect," Aurora said. "I tell you every time we come here that the legal speed is now sixty-five, not fifty-five. You had better put the pedal to the metal, if that is the correct expression."<br>"The pedal's to the metal, otherwise we wouldn't be moving at all," Rosie said. "Why do you think I been bugging you about a Datsun pickup? I could push the pedal through the radiator and this old whale wouldn't go more than fifty-five. Besides, the speed limit's only fifty-five when you're going through a town, and we're going through Conroe."<br>"Don't be pedantic when I'm sad," Aurora said. "Just try to go a little faster."<br>Rosie, in a daring maneuver, attempted to pass the sluggish white Toyota just as a truck behind them pulled out to pass them. The driver honked, and Rosie instantly whipped her arm out the window and gave him the finger. Then, not appeased, she actually stuck her head out the window, turned it, and glared at the truck driver.<br>Unimpressed, the truck driver honked again, while Rosie, pedal to the metal, inched grimly past the white suburban.<br>"Well, you don't lack spunk -- you never have or I'd have squished you myself," Aurora said.<br>The trucker, perhaps annoyed, perhaps amused, began to tap his horn every few seconds, and Rosie -- definitely not amused -- stuck her arm out the window and left it there, with her middle finger extended for his benefit.<br>The sight of her maid sustaining a rude gesture while virtually beneath the wheels of a giant truck made Aurora laugh. A vagrant bubble of mirth rose unexpectedly from inside her, but she had no more than started a little peal when sorrow came back in a flood and overran amusement, just as her Cadillac seemed about to be overrun by the eighteen-wheeler.<br>"I hope it kills us, then this will be over!" she cried, as she was crying.<br>"I'm from Bossier City, and I ain't about to be bullied by no truck," Rosie said. She calculated that she now had at least a three-or-four-inch lead on the Toyota and was nerving up to make her cut to the right.<br>When Aurora calmed for the second time they were well down the road past the airport exit -- she could see the skyscrapers of downtown Houston through the summer haze.<br>"I can no longer laugh without beginning to cry," she reported, rolling down her window. She proceeded to mess with Texas to the extent of another fifteen or twenty Kleenex.<br>"You wasn't really laughing, you was just mainly crying," Rosie said.<br>Copyright � 1992 by Larry McMurtry</p><h2>Unwomanly Face Of War</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Svetlana Alexievich (Author) Svetlana Alexievich was born in Ivano-Frankivsk in 1948 and has spent most of her life in the Soviet Union and present-day Belarus, with prolonged periods of exile in Western Europe.

Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.Pickax City columnist and wealthy bachelor Jim Qwilleran travels to Scotland, leaving his Siamese cats Koko and Yum Yum at home, in one of the most lively recent entries in Braun's popular "The Cat Who . . . " series. Also on the Bonnie Scots Tour are Qwill's current woman friend, Polly Duncan, the Moose County librarian; and his recently returned former girlfriend, Dr. Melinda Goodwinter, who proposes marriage. Tour leader Irma Hasselrich (a friend of Polly's and a patient of Melinda's) dies of apparently natural causes; then a jewel case and the tour-bus driver disappear. Qwill, Polly and Melinda decamp the tour early; back in Pickax City, listening to tape recordings he made along the way--and to Koko's intuitive yowls--Qwill begins to suspect that Irma was murdered. Convincing others, however, takes time and an investigation. Although the cats play a smaller role in this installment than in previous ones, Braun's descriptions of Scottish lore and the complications of Qwill's love life will enchant fans.

She is the author of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. Darling was born in 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a large and close-knit family. Painting was a popular family recreation, and almost every family excursion included one or more easels and a variety of sketch pads, chalks, paints, and pencils. For four years, the family lived on a hundred-acre farm in Kentucky. Here young Sandra grew especially fond of riding and training horses, and became a dog owner for the first time. Living in the country also provided plenty of time for reading, a life-long passion. </p><p>Sandra illustrated her first book in 1983: <i>The Teddy Bears' Picnic</i>, a popular children's song by Jimmy Kennedy. That same year, she was visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when she came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image proved the inspiration for <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the book's main character. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the seven sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients. </p><p>About her work Sandra says: "I think that one of the reasons my illustrations have appealed to people is that they can sense my sincerity. I know that marvels exist which are just outside our ordinary experience, but that at any moment we may turn a corner and encounter one of them. Children also believe this, and because they and I have this conviction in common, we, as creator and audience, make good partners." Sandra lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband, Harold.</p>Ages 4-7. In his previous appearances, Carl the rottweiler has looked after baby Madeleine when her mother takes a brief excursion, as in <i>Carl's Afternoon in the Park</i> (1991), or when her parents both go out for the evening, as in <i>Carl's Masquerade</i>. But this time Carl takes charge of a roomful of children when Madeleine's pull-toy dislodges the day-care room's doorstop, locking the teacher out and Carl and all the youngsters in. Not prone to panic, Carl follows the posted list of the day's activities, from music time to nap time. All the while, the teacher is spotted outside futilely trying to pry open the window, unscrew the door lock, climb through the skylight, and even pull the door down with her car. Finally she holds a sign up in the window requesting Carl to open the door. Once again, Day's expressive paintings energetically detail the comic scene; just a few lines of conversational text introduce and conclude the story, which is sure to be a favorite in a deservedly popular series. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>The Cadfael Companion: The World of Brother Cadfael</h2><p>Introduced by Ellis Peters, an elegantly bound, richly illustrated reference guide to the world of Peters&#39;s very popular medieval sleuth, Brother Cadfael, covers all of the characters, settings, and trivia of the mystery series.</p><p></p><h2>Windblown World: The Journals of Jack Kerouac 1947-1954</h2><p>Excerpts and passages from the personal diaries of the great Beat writer chronicle a pivotal era in Kerouac&#39;s life, describing the creation of his first novel, The Town and City; his special friendships with Allen Ginsberg, William S.

He is the award-winning author of twelve books, including, most recently, <i>Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War</i>.Adult/High School&#x2013;These entries cover Kerouac's mid-20s, when he was completing his first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, and beginning what were to become <i>Dr. Sax</i> and <i>On the Road</i>. Much of the book is devoted to issues of writing&#x2013;character, plot, style&#x2013;and a daily obsession with word count that any writer will appreciate. Discussions of favorite authors like C�line, Twain, and Dostoyevsky highlight some influences, and Kerouac shows his early iconoclastic tendencies through an almost rampant hatred of academics and the literary establishment. Anecdotes about partying with Allen Ginsburg and William S. Burroughs, the New York jazz world, and finding a girlfriend are peppered throughout. The final section is devoted to the cross-country trip made with Neal Cassady and others that inspired <i>On the Road</i>. These narratives of the landscapes of the U.S. and Mexico are hauntingly beautiful and contain hints of the quasi-spontaneous style that made both Kerouac and the Beat movement so different and so popular. The introduction, notations, and index are invaluable to those less familiar with the time period or Kerouac's life. But the real charm of this title is in his words; seeing this young, brilliant author develop and continually push himself toward greatness is gripping and astonishing. The reality of Kerouac proves far more moving and interesting than the bad-boy image.<i>&#x2013;Matthew L.

A half-hearted investigator, Bird agrees to track down the ex-husband of Rita Purdue and get the child support she has coming to her. And when Rita and her son are killed and the finger of suspicion points to Billy Purdue, Bird still feels a moral obligation to find the young man, even though he can't believe he's a killer. Then the bodies begin piling up, among them a bunch of Cambodian killers, some mob-connected Boston gangsters, a couple of people to whom Billy turned for refuge, and an old woman in a nursing home who dies with the name of a bogeyman on her lips--the mysterious Caleb Kyle. It's not the first time Bird's heard that name: his grandfather, who was also a cop, spent his last years trying to track down the legendary monster whose name was always used to scare kids into doing what they were supposed to. And it's not only his grandfather's ghost that haunts Bird as he attempts to solve the mystery of who Billy Purdue really is; the spirits of his dead wife and child urge him on in his attempt to find justice for Rita and her child as well. Aided in his quest by two unlikely but compellingly realized associates, a gay hit man and his lover, Bird confronts the evil that lurks in a mythical monster who turns out to be all too real, and comes to terms, finally, with the grief that has colored his life black since the death of his family.

By age eleven, she had been deported, along with her mother, to Theresienstadt, the first in a series of concentration camps which would become the setting for her precarious childhood. Kluger's story of her years in the camps and her struggle to establish a life after the war as a refugee survivor in New York, has emerged as one of the most powerful accounts of the Holocaust.<br><br>Interwoven with blunt, unsparing observations of childhood and nuanced reflections of an adult who has spent a lifetime thinking about the Holocaust, <i>Still Alive</i> rejects all easy assumptions about history, both political and personal. Whether describing the abuse she met at her own mother's hand, the life-saving generosity of a woman SS aide in Auschwitz, the foibles and prejudices of Allied liberators, or the cold shoulder offered by her relatives when she and her mother arrived as refugees in New York, Kluger sees and names an unexpected reality which has little to do with conventional wisdom or morality tales.<br><br><i>Still Alive</i> is a memoir of the pursuit of selfhood against all odds, a fiercely bittersweet coming-of-age story in which the protagonist must learn never to rely on comforting assumptions, but always to seek her own truth.</p><p>"Instead of God I believe in ghosts," writes the literary scholar Ruth Kluger in this harrowing memoir of life under the yellow star, a controversial bestseller in Germany.<p> Born in Vienna, Kluger somehow survived a girlhood spent in Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and Gross-Rosen. Some of the lessons she imparts are surprising, as when she argues, against other historians, that the female camp guards were far more humane than their male counterparts, and when she admits that she has difficulty today queuing in line, a constant of camp life, "out of revulsion for the bovine activity of simply standing." Her memories of her youth are punctuated by sharp reflections on the meaning of the Shoah and how it should best be memorialized in a time when ever fewer survivors are left to act as witnesses. Those reflections are often angry--"Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps," she writes, recalling an argument with a naive German graduate student, "and he expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for?"</p><p> But they are constantly provocative, too. Though readers will doubtless take issue with some of her conclusions, Kluger's insistent memoir merits a wide audience. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Ruth Kluger is professor emeritus of German literature at UC-Irvine.

Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner, expounds on the steady but quiet growth of an Israeli nuclear industry that proved so successful that Israel was able to coerce several U.S. administrations into doing its bidding. He also explores in depth Israeli access to U.S. intelligence satellite technologies that resulted from inattention by Washington leaders as well as from the four years of insider spying by Jonathan Jay Pollard. He reveals that the Soviet Union has been targeted by Israeli nuclear warheads since the mid-1980s. Unlike several other recent expos es of Israeli intelligence apparatus (Ian Black and Benny Morris's Israel's Secret Wars , LJ 8/91, and Andrew and Leslie Cockburn's Dangerous Liaison , LJ 6/15/91), Hersh follows the threads of a specific intelligence focus while highlighting U.S. policies that ultimately ignore the very real presence of the Israeli nuclear arsenal.

Yet here he stood, literally up to his ankles in the blood of Christians. While alive, the four brothers had been exceptionally beautiful young men. But after their terrible deaths brought about by beatings and torture, they were unrecognizable masses of blood and flesh. The sight made him want to retch, but he could not appear to be weak before his citizens. </p><p>Pius was, for the most part, tolerant of the irksome minority who called themselves Christians. He even found it stimulating to participate in debates with those who were educated and reasonable. However odd he personally found their beliefs&#x2014;about the single messiah who rose from the dead and would come again&#x2014;their ideas did appear to be spreading at an unnervingly steady pace throughout Rome. A number of Roman nobles had converted to Christianity openly, and their participation in Christian rituals was tolerated by his government. This growing sect was also finding particular popularity with highborn females; women were included as equals in all its rites and ceremonies. They could even be priests in this strange new world of Christian thought and practice. </p><p>The Roman priests who held court in the temples of Jupiter and Saturn were up in arms that these Christians were allowed to offend the gods with their ridiculous concept of a single deity. Emperor Pius generally ignored the priests&#x2019; wailings, and thus life in Rome went on in relative peace during much of his reign. It was only when some aberration developed to endanger lives in the Roman republic, some tragedy or natural disaster, that the Christians found themselves mortally threatened. The Roman priests, and their followers, were quick to blame the Christians for any and all misfortunes that might befall Rome. Surely it was their monotheistic insult to the true gods of the republic that caused divine retribution to fall on the other innocent and obedient citizens? </p><p>Emperor Pius had himself discovered in his debates that there were two types of Christians: the wild-eyed fanatics who often seemed anxious to die to prove their great piety, and the truly reasonable and compassionate adherents who were more devoted to helping the poor and healing the sick than they were to preaching and converting. Pius definitely preferred the latter type; they were making a positive contribution to their communities and were valuable citizens. These Christians, whom he called the Compassionates, were fond of telling stories of their messiah and his great healing ability and of quoting his very wise words about the need for charity. Most often, they spoke passionately about the power of love and its many forms. Indeed there were even some Christians here in Rome who claimed direct descent from their messiah himself, through his children who had settled in Europe. These claimants were the same Compassionates who worked tirelessly to help the suffering and the poor. Their undisputed leader was a stunning and charismatic noblewoman called Lady Petronella. The flame-haired Petronella was beloved by the people of Rome, despite her openly Christian practices, as she was the daughter and heiress of one of Rome&#x2019;s oldest families. She used her wealth generously for the highest good of the republic and preached only of the need for love and tolerance. If Petronella and her Compassionates, had been the only kind of Christian in Rome, this onslaught of terrible bloodshed would likely never have begun. </p><p>But the group of Christians that Pius referred to as the Fanatics were another story altogether. In contrast to the Compassionates, who spoke of their messiah in warm and devoted tones as the great teacher of a spiritual path they called the Way of Love, the Fanatics screeched of the one true God who would eliminate all others and bring about a reign of terror for the unbelievers at a time of final judgment. The Romans were deeply offended by this perspective, and the Fanatics compounded <br>the offense by insisting that life on earth did not matter and that only the afterlife was of importance. Such a philosophy, such a craven disregard for the gift of life that the gods bestowed upon mortals, was absolute sacrilege to the Roman priests and their followers. It was incomprehensible to a culture of people who celebrated the experience of the physical senses in their countless spiritual and civic festivals. To most Romans, the Fanatics were an enigma born out of madness, a group to be shunned if not feared. </p><p>Thus it was the Fanatics who raised the ire of the Roman people, even when there were no natural disasters to contend with. But when <br>a deadly influenza outbreak struck an affluent Roman suburb, the priests of Saturn began to cry for the blood of Christians to appease their god. </p><p>In the center of this growing drama was a wealthy Roman widow, the Lady Felicita. Felicita had converted to Christianity when, overcome by grief following the sudden death of her noble and beloved husband, she had turned her back on the Roman gods. It was said that, left alone to raise seven sons without a father, she went mad with the anguish of her loss. Felicita was visited by Christians who offered her comfort in her mourning, and she ultimately found strength and so-<br>lace in the Fanatics&#x2019; extreme perspective on the absolute importance of the afterlife. In this ideal, Felicita was consoled that her husband was in a better place where she would join him one day, and they would be together with their children as a family in heaven. </p><p>While Felicita burned with the passion of the newly converted, most of the nobles in her community were not overly upset by her behavior. Felicita would spend hours each day on her knees in prayer, but most felt that this was her own business. In addition, Felicita was charitable and generous, donating portions of her dead husband&#x2019;s fortune to the building of a hospital and compelling her older sons to contribute physical labor to help the infirm. As a result, Felicita&#x2019;s strong and beautiful children were very popular with the people of the Roman suburb in which they dwelled. The boys ranged in age from the golden-haired youngest, called Martial, who was in his seventh summer, to the tall and athletic eldest, Januarius, who was twenty years on earth. </p><p>The world in which Felicita and her sons lived remained relatively peaceful until the influenza swept into their town. It struck intermittently and at random, but those who were afflicted by it rarely survived the extreme fevers that accompanied the retching and convulsions. When the firstborn son of a Saturnian priest succumbed to the illness, the distraught man rallied the population to join him in accusing Felicita and her sons of bringing down the wrath of the gods upon them. Clearly, Saturn had punished his own priest to make his point clear: the Romans would need to be strong in their opposition to these Christian people who dared to regard their true gods as obsolete. The gods would not stand for it, and certainly not a god such as Saturn, who was the domineering and ruthless patriarch of the Roman pantheon. Hadn&#x2019;t Saturn even devoured his own son when he found him to be disobedient? </p><p>Felicita and all seven of her children were subsequently brought before the regional magistrate, Publius. Because of Felicita&#x2019;s noble status, they were not shackled by chains or tied but were allowed to enter the court of their own volition. Felicita was a handsome woman, tall and well built, with flowing dark hair and the walk of a queen. She stood straight and proud before the court, never wavering and showing no fear. </p><p>The proceedings began calmly and were carried out with due order. While Magistrate Publius was known to have a harsh streak when provoked, he was not as monstrous as some of the local jurists were known to be. He read out the charges against Felicita and her sons in measured tones. </p><p>&#x201c;Lady Felicita, you and your children have been brought to this court today under suspicion. The citizens of Rome have grave concerns that you have angered our gods, most specifically, that you have offended Saturn, the great father of the gods. Saturn has taken vengeance upon your community, claiming the lives of a number of your neighbors, including innocent children, as a result. The laws of our people state that &#x2018;refusal to accept the gods angers the gods and disrupts the forces of the universe. When the gods have been angered, those culprits who have caused their consternation must beg forgiveness by making sacrifices to them.&#x2019; Therefore you and your children are commanded to worship in the Temple of Saturn for eight days, making appropriate sacrifices as designated by the priests until the god has been appeased.

This 17th edition, under Kaplan&#39;s splendid direction, contains over 20,000 quotations, representing 2,500 authors, 90 of whom are new to BARTLETT&#39;S. New comers include Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Tony Kushner, Tammy Wynette, Margaret Atwood, Mary Oliver, Maya Angelou, Frank O&#39;Hara, Martin Amis, Kingsley Amis, Mother Teresa, Jacques Cousteau, Rudolph Giuliani, Alfred Hitchcock, L. M. Montgomery, Eric Ambler, Jerry Seinfeld, J.K. Rowling, Katharine Graham, and Emma Goldman. With quotations presented in chronological order, in the famous BARTLETT&#39;S tradition, BARTLETT&#39;S gives the reader a vast panorama of the world, from the ancient Egyptians to the latest movie, from the inspirational and the beautiful to the sardonic and the downright funny.</p><p>John Bartlett: First published in 1855, BARTLETT&#39;S FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS has been completely updated and revised for the 17th edition.According to his entry in <i>American National Biography,</i> "ask John Bartlett" was once a common answer to questions in the environs of Harvard College. Bartlett went to work in a Cambridge, Massachusetts, bookstore when he was 16, and "his copious memory and love of books soon had university faculty and students using him as a ready reference tool." His notebook of common phrases and quotations eventually became <i>A Collection of Familiar Quotations</i>, which he had privately printed in 1855. By the time he died in 1905, the collection had gone through nine editions. Almost 100 years and eight editions later, people still ask John Bartlett when they are seeking the source of a common phrase or hoping to dress up a speech with a pithy saying.<p>The seventeenth edition of <i>Bartlett's</i> has 25,000 quotations from 2,500 authors. It follows in the path of its predecessors by adhering to certain traditions yet also strives to remain relevant and up-to-date. Bartlett's original collection relied heavily on literary sources, such as the Bible and Shakespeare, and these, as current editor Kaplan tells us in his preface, "are still major components." Structurally, arrangement is still chronological and access is abetted by an index of authors and a very detailed keyword index. But for this edition, hundreds of "purely mechanical, nonsubstantive cross-reference and footnotes" have been eliminated, and full citations are used in place of the often-confusing <i>Ibid.</i> And Bartlett's continues to widen its net beyond canonical sources, casting about for material from culture both high and low. New among the quoted are Maya Angelou, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Princess Diana, Rudy Giuliani, Frank McCourt, Robert McNamara, and Jerry Seinfeld. Selections from Charles Darwin, Bob Dylan, and Virginia Woolf, among others, have been expanded. Some authors, such as popular eighteenth-century English writer Anna Laetitia Barbauld, have been excised, although cutting has not been as deep for this edition as it was for the sixteenth, also edited by Kaplan.</p><p>There are hundreds of other quotation books from which to choose. Among those that are comparable in size to <i>Bartlett's,</i> <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</i> (5th ed., 1999) is arranged alphabetically by author, and <i>Random House Webster's Quotationary</i> (1999) is arranged by subject. In addition to these general anthologies, there are books of quotations by women and by African Americans; books of humorous or religions quotations; and books for quotations about movies or sports (for a rundown of some recent examples, see "Other People's Words: Recent Quotation Books," in our July 2002 issue). Strictly speaking, the new <i>Bartlett's</i> may not be a necessary purchase for libraries that have the sixteenth edition and a good array of other fairly current titles. But because it is one of the handful of reference staples that patrons are likely to ask for by name, no self-respecting library should be without it. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He brings a unique perspective and impeccable academic credentials to a narrative history of the British Empire, one that avoids sweeping judgmental condemnation and instead sees the Empire for what it was: a series of local fiefdoms administered in varying degrees of competence or brutality by a cast of characters as outsized and eccentric as anything conjured by Gilbert and Sullivan. <p>The truth, as Kwarteng reveals, is that there was no such thing as a model for imperial administration; instead, appointees were schooled in quirky, independent-minded individuality. As a result the Empire was the product not of a grand idea but of often chaotic individual improvisation. The idosyncracies of viceroys and soldier-diplomats who ran the colonial enterprise continues to impact the world, from Kashmir to Sudan, Baghdad to Hong Kong.</p></p><p>Kwasi Kwarteng was born in London to Ghanaian parents in 1975. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won one of the University Classical Scholarships and graduated with a double first in Classics and History; and at Harvard University, where he spent a year as a Kennedy Scholar. He returned to Cambridge to complete a Ph.D in History, before working as an analyst for a hedge fund in London. He was recently elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament.Kwasi Kwarteng, in this fine book, argues that the empire granted far too much authority to the wrong people Ghosts of Empire' explores six cases where this impact was felt: Iraq, Nigeria, Sudan, Hong Kong, Kashmir and Burma.&nbsp;This is a list without many success stories, and Kwarteng, who is a Conservative member of Parliament with Ghanaian parents and who claims to want to transcend sterile' debates about the empire, ends up making a damning case . Kwarteng is critical but not patronizing, allowing the reader to grasp the motivations of the British while simultaneously seeing the shortcomings of their decisions.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>CHOICE</i></b> At once decidedly traditional, focusing on high politics and personality at the expense of structural analysis or much attention to colonial societies themselves, and remarkably fresh, touring the empire's byways and comparative backwaters rather than the more familiar terrain of the Raj and southern Africa The writing is clear, Kwarteng has a particular talent for pen portraits, and he largely steers clear of imperial nostalgia.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Shepherd Express</i></b> A thought-provoking and plausible appraisal. One could add that [Kwarteng] is a legacy of the British Empire.&#x201d;<p></p><b><i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i></b><br><br><p><b><i>Indian Express</i>, September 11, 2011<br></b> [Kwarteng's] book is still a reminder that a superpower's legacy of intervention will be determined by outcomes that obtain after its eventual retreat.&#x201d;</p><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>October 3, 2011</b> [An] expertly researched and written book&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Kirkus</i>, November 2011<br></b> [A] fascinating debut Kwarteng effectively illustrates the effects of empire in a forceful and thorough book that holds important lessons for today's leaders in particular that the cost of invading and occupying a country always exceeds expectations.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Business Day</i></b><b> (Nigeria)</b> [Ghosts of Empire is] one of several books that currently reappraising what might seem a tired old subject, but in the present strange mood now prevalent, it is worth more examination Kwarteng's book is a useful reminder that Britain's empire left many uncomfortable legacies on which the author focuses attention&#x201d;.<p><b>John Spurling,&nbsp;</b><i><b>The New Republic<br></b></i> This is an absorbing, richly researched book, smoothly written with a light touch, and suggests, if its gifted Ghanaian/British author is anything to go by, that the Empire at least got something right.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Andrew Roberts, </b></p><br><br><i><b>Wall Street Journal<br></b></i> Mr. Kwarteng is an engaging writer, and his pen portraits of British imperialists are subtle and scholarly.&#x201d;<p></p><p><b>Thomas Wise, </b><i><b>Daily Beast</b></i><br> While trained as a historian at Cambridge, Kwarteng is no ivory-tower dweller, but rather a man who believes in the power of history to inform, inspire, and challenge the present.. Using case studies from six different regions of the British Empire Iraq, Kashmir, Burma, Sudan, Nigeria, and Hong Kong he illustrates the ad hoc, ill-informed, incoherent, and frequently contradictory nature of British imperial rule.&#x201d;</p><p><i><b>DBC Reads</b></i><br> There is a lot to learn from Kwasi Kwarteng's <i>Ghosts of Empire</i>. The text itself serves as a wonderful example of a historical work that can be palatable for the masses without sacrificing academic rigor or scholarship exhaustive in detail and citation, but written in plain language. On a political-slash-historical level, <i>Ghosts of Empire</i> is proof of a certain self-awareness on the other side of the pond that will hopefully make its way over soon: the citizenry's understanding of their country's past mistakes, acknowledged without fear of public admonishment.&#x201d;</p><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><h2>Our Dumb World: The Onion&#39;s Atlas of the Planet Earth, 73rd Edition</h2><p>Our Dumb World: The Onion's Atlas of The Planet Earth, 73rd Edition features incorrect statistics on all of the Earth's 168, 182, or 196 independent nations.

He and his family make their home on Sugarloaf Mountain outside Roanoke, Virginia.The world in which we live is, as the clich� has it, 24/7. Thanks mainly to artificial illumination, which A. Roger Ekirch correctly calls "the greatest symbol of modern progress," nothing ever has to stop. Businesses run 'round the clock, late shows featuring one comic or another keep people happily awake into the late hours, trucks pick up shipments and make deliveries. In Spain and Latin America, people sit down to dinner at 10 p.m. and stay at table into the early morning. Criminals still operate under cover of darkness, but there's plenty of street light from which they must flee, and law-enforcement officers have sophisticated equipment for spotlighting them. <p>It's been thus for so many generations that we take it for granted: Night is when we go out, when we entertain, when we read, when -- of course -- we sleep. Yet in the long span of human history this is a relatively recent development. Not until "the period from 1730 to 1830," Ekirch argues in this interesting, original book, did the Western world undergo "such a sustained assault upon the nocturnal realm," and not until the 20th century and its near-universal use of artificial light did nighttime become what we know now. So At Day's Close is uncommonly welcome, for it covers ground that just about all others have ignored: </p><p>"This book sets out to explore the history of nighttime in Western society before the advent of the Industrial Revolution. My chief interest lies in the way of life people fashioned after dark in the face of both real and supernatural perils. Notwithstanding major studies on crime and witchcraft, night, in its own right, has received scant attention, principally due to the longstanding presumption that little else of consequence transpired. 'No occupation but sleepe, feed, and fart,' to quote the Jacobean poet Thomas Middleton, might best express this traditional mindset. . . . Nighttime has remained a terra incognita of peripheral concern, the forgotten half of the human experience, even though families spent long hours in obscurity." </p><p>Ekirch, who teaches history at Virginia Tech and who writes exceptionally well, has spent a couple of decades on this book, with impressive results. The range of his research is both broad and deep, including poems and diaries, public documents and the press, pamphlets and court papers. The "British Isles form the heart of my inquiry," he writes, "but extensive material is included from across the Continent. In addition, I have incorporated relevant information from early America and Eastern Europe. The book's time period is equally broad, stretching from the late Middle Ages to the early nineteenth century, though the principal focus is the early modern era (ca. 1500-1750)." </p><p>The first thing to understand about nighttime half a millennium ago is that it inspired fear. It still does in many people, of course, but today's uneasiness about the dark is nothing compared to that of the 16th century, when "evening appeared fraught with menace." Night "in the early modern world summoned the worst elements in man, nature, and the cosmos. Murderers and thieves, terrible calamities and satanic spirits lurked everywhere." People died at night, when, for various reasons now commonly understood by physicians and scientists, resistance to illness weakened. Ghosts, demons, spirits, banshees, vampires and fairies were understood to venture abroad at night, and Satan himself was on the prowl, "indeed darkness had become Satan's unholy realm on earth, a shadow government from which to wage perpetual warfare against the kingdom of Christ." </p><p>Apart from the fears inspired by nature and superstition, people did plenty to make things worse. Alcohol, "the lubricant of early modern life," led to drowning, accidents and violence. Then as now, "human malevolence" was widespread, especially under cover of night. What families "feared most was the invasion of their dwellings by burglars," so "every evening, men retired with their families to the shelter of their homes, whose sanctity they were charged with preserving." The "worst bloodletting" in a world where bloodletting was common occurred at night, "not only from armed robbers but, more often, from street fracases and personal assaults. An Italian proverb warned, 'Who goes out at night looks for a beating.' " </p><p>The English called nightfall "shutting-in," which literally meant the shutting-in of daylight but came to mean "the need for households to bolt portals against the advancing darkness." All "doors, shutters, and windows were closed tight and latched," and "seldom was God's protection more valued than at night." The fervor with which people prayed was deep and real: They feared violence, fire, death, even the possibility that the next day the sun itself would fail to rise. Cities provided primitive illumination with lanterns, and watchmen patrolled the streets, but the light was dim and inconsistent at best, and the watchmen inspired more laughter than fear, to wit, the constable Dogberry in Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing," under whose "merry command, parish officers turned a willing backside to benches but a blind eye to thieves." </p><p>Yet all was not fear and danger. People did go out at night, though they sometimes ran afoul of rutted roads and highwaymen. Inside their houses, people discovered the pleasures of privacy. Some made love. By candlelight some played cards, dice, whist, backgammon and quadrille. Many raised (and raised again) the glass of hospitality and cheer. A British diarist named Thomas Turner had a high old time: </p><p>"We were very merry tonight &amp; kept it up late. . . . Not one of us went to bed sober. . . . We continued drinking like horses (as the vulgar phrase is) and singing till many of us was very drunk, and then we went to dancing and pulling off wigs, caps, and hats. And there we continued in this frantic manner (behaving more like mad people than they that profess the name of Christians)." </p><p>The upper classes soon discovered more sophisticated (and more expensive) pleasures. In the late Middle Ages, "across Europe, from London to Vienna, noble courts staged lavish entertainments against the blackness of night. . . . Spectacular fireworks displays enjoyed immense popularity, as did theatrical performances utilizing new techniques of stage lighting." Rich young men with time on their hands went wild: "Bloods, bucks, and blades, roarers and gallants . . . embraced night as a time of boundless freedom" and pursued "gratification, free of social obligations and constraints." Samuel Johnson dismissed them as "lords of the street. . . flushed as they are with folly, youth and wine." </p><p>Others went to work at night. The human excreta deposited in cesspools and gutters had to be removed, and so did the bodies of the dead; these unpleasant tasks were carried out by "professional nightmen" and other functionaries. In Paris, at the famous market Les Halles, an 18th-century writer noted that "the noise of voices never stops, there is hardly a light to be seen; most of the deals are done in the dark, as though these were people of a different race, hiding in their caverns from the light of the sun." Country neighbors had nocturnal "work parties," in which men and women shared various tasks, from stripping corn to spinning wool. These "bees," as they were called in England and America, became occasions for socializing as well as working, and nighttime encouraged people to lower their inhibitions against loose talk and laughter. </p><p>While they worked, most other people slept, but precisely why they did so is a matter of considerable mystery. Whether human beings are genetically programmed to sleep at night is far from clear: "The custom of reserving nighttime for rest, some psychologists now surmise, evolved gradually among prehistoric peoples. Only with the passage of time did these first generations learn to sleep away the dangers of darkness by resting in caves, sheltered from foraging predators." By the Middle Ages nocturnal sleep had been programmed into the human clock, but it was different from what we know now. Because people feared "the evil aire of the night," windows were tightly closed; bedfellows were common and numerous, less for amatory reasons than for security against burglars and hobgoblins; "lice, fleas, and bedbugs, the unholy trinity of early modern entomology," invaded the sleeping quarters of rich and poor alike. </p><p>By the mid-18th century, all of these conditions began to change. For a variety of reasons -- "the rapid spread of scientific rationalism during the early stages of the Enlightenment," the rise of "consumerism and nascent industrialization," and "the leisured affluence of urban households" -- many of the old fears about night diminished or vanished. It was the beginning of the modern world, one in which, as Ekirch wisely notes, "with darkness diminished, opportunities for privacy, intimacy, and self-reflection will grow more scarce." In this, as with so much else about progress, there is much to welcome and much to mourn. </p><p><br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

The baked dish was brought in, wrapped in a white linen napkin, the way Edie would have served it, and as it was spooned onto the plate I had my first whiff. Then, when I took a taste, the hot raisins bursting in my mouth, the sensation was so powerful that the tears rolled down my cheeks (adding a little salty flavor).<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> I discovered from Edna Lewis how much better crushed sugar cubes are than plain granulated sugar as a topping.

I steeled myself for something weighty, perhaps about whether I believed in heaven and hell. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Then she looked at me and asked: &#x201c;Tell me, Judith, do you really like garlic?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t lie. Yes, I admitted, I adored garlic. She looked so crestfallen at that moment that I was sure she felt a sense of finality about the wayward path her younger daughter had taken. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>To her, garlic represented everything alien and vulgar. It smelled bad, and people who handled it or ate it smelled bad. Moreover, it covered up the natural flavor of honest food&#x2014;and that was suspect. Those French chefs, for instance, why did they have to put a sauce on everything, anyway? No doubt to disguise the taste because what was underneath wasn&#x2019;t very fresh to begin with. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>In my mother&#x2019;s house we were always being told to get rid of the smells, to make sure that the kitchen door was shut, that the windows were open. Not only was garlic banned, onions were permitted only when a lamb stew was being prepared, for which two or three well-boiled small white onions per person were deemed appropriate. That&#x2019;s all that were purchased; Mother didn&#x2019;t want our cook, Edie Price, sneaking a little chopped onion into her meatloaf. And heaven forbid that indigestible, raw pieces might find their way into a tuna-fish sandwich. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Still, I have to admit that the unadulterated English-style food I grew up on had its merits. I always loved our Sunday dinner prime rib roast with Yorkshire pudding, which my British grandfather, whenever he was present, would carve at the table, deftly cutting thin&#x2014;too thin, I always thought&#x2014;rosy slices. My father, Charles Bailey, who was called Monty because he grew up in Montpelier, Vermont, somehow never lost the mischievous charm of a small-town boy after he had to settle in New York City. When he married into the Hedley family, he made a point of carving clumsy, thick slices, and so was banished as the family carver. My mother took over. I can still see her standing at the head of the table honing her knife on a sharpening steel, and I would always try to sneak a nibble from the platter when she wasn&#x2019;t looking. The knuckle-bone meat on a lamb roast was irresistible. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I am grateful, too, that those organ meats that people spurn today often graced our table: liver and bacon, beefsteak and kidney pie, breaded sweetbreads&#x2014;I lapped them up and still find all forms of innards an earthy delight. Frugality was considered a virtue. One never let things go to waste, so our cook, Edie, learned to turn leftovers into wonderful dishes: crispy croquettes with creamy lamb, ham, or chicken inside; shepherd&#x2019;s pie of ground-up leftover lamb with a mashed-potato topping; minced meats in cream on toast; stuffed vegetables. We also had a meatless night once a week, either for the sake of economy or because it was good for us to forgo the pleasure of flesh, I&#x2019;m not sure. For quite a few years after I graduated from the nursery table to the grown-up dinner table, I thought when we were served breaded and fried eggplant or broiled mushrooms that they were a form of meat. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t dare ask, because one wasn&#x2019;t supposed to talk about food at the table (it was considered crude, like talking about sex). And if we indulged in appreciative sounds like &#x201c;yum-yum,&#x201d; we just might be sent from the table. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Nor could we make disparaging remarks if something displeased us. I remember how endlessly long the winter seemed when all that Mr. Volpe, our Italian fruit-and-vegetable vendor on the corner, could produce was overgrown root vegetables, sprouts and cabbage, and tired potatoes. Then what greens we could get were cooked so long that an unappetizing cabbagy smell permeated the air, and it was hard to get down our due portion. But we weren&#x2019;t allowed to say a word. It did take me some time, though, to appreciate parsnips and broccoli. When, finally, spring broke through and we tasted our first asparagus, even though slightly overcooked, it was a treat worth waiting for. And we were allowed to pick up the spears with our fingers. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t remember ever going shopping with my mother in the city to pick out the first vegetables and fruits of the season. Food shopping was invariably done by phone, as though to keep a distance from the things of the earth. In the summer, though, a truck with fresh farm produce would do a tour of the lake in Vermont where we had our summer cottage, and it was fun to go out and greet the local farmer and get a look at what he had just pulled from the soil. Every week the butcher&#x2019;s truck would stop by, and I once persuaded him to let me ride with him as he made his rounds. I was impressed with the way he wielded his knife and would lop off a slab of meat which, when he put it on the scales, would always come within an ounce of what the customer had ordered. The back of the truck was chilled only by a block of ice, and as the warmth of the summer day penetrated, the smell of raw meat became tantalizingly strong. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Meat was such an important part of everyone&#x2019;s diet that when we were plunged into World War II and were suddenly confronted with rationing, there was a sense of deprivation. I was away at college in Bennington, Vermont, in those years, and we had a huge Victory Garden in which all had to participate. I remember how the erudite critic Kenneth Burke insisted that he conduct his class out in the burgeoning fields, because he felt that having our feet planted firmly in the soil and nurturing the fruits of the earth would encourage our minds to soar. We were also asked to volunteer for poultry duty, and I felt very virtuous beheading and plucking and eviscerating chickens by the dozens&#x2014;all in expectation of a good dinner, of course. Bennington was known for its superior food, and I&#x2019;m not ashamed to admit that, after sampling the fare at a number of sister colleges, I just may have chosen Bennington because I liked to eat well. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, back home in New York, meat was scarce. My parents had acquired a Kerry blue terrier, no doubt to fill the gap left by their last daughter&#x2019;s going off to college, and they were finding it so hard to get enough meat to feed this hungry animal that they finally gave him to Albert, the butcher. Or so the story goes. The other version is that my mischievous father, now that there were no children around, had to take the dog out every night for what seemed increasingly long walks. Now, in those days, Third Avenue in the East Sixties was still a thoroughly Irish neighborhood; the el rattled through, and there was a pub on every corner. During the daytime, when my mother walked the dog, she began to notice how he would stop at several of the nearby pubs and pull her in, tail wagging in happy anticipation of a doggy treat. Then it dawned on her why those evening walks were taking Monty so long. She quickly made an arrangement with the butcher. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>But back to those earlier childhood memories at the table. Above all, we always ate what was put in front of us, especially if we wanted dessert. To me those homemade desserts of British ancestry were the crowning glory of the meal, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have missed them for anything. I still feel nostalgic for the warm chocolate steamed pudding with foamy sauce, the bread pudding with its crusty top and raisins bursting inside, the apple br...</p><h2>The End of Your Life Book Club</h2><p><p>&#x201c;What are you reading?&#x201d;<br><br> That&#x2019;s the question Will Schwalbe asks his mother, Mary Anne, as they sit in the waiting room of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In 2007, Mary Anne returned from a humanitarian trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan suffering from what her doctors believed was a rare type of hepatitis. Months later she was diagnosed with a form of advanced pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal, often in six months or less. <br><br> This is the inspiring true story of a son and his mother, who start a &#x201c;book club&#x201d; that brings them together as her life comes to a close. Over the next two years, Will and Mary Anne carry on conversations that are both wide-ranging and deeply personal, prompted by an eclectic array of books and a shared passion for reading. Their list jumps from classic to popular, from poetry to mysteries, from fantastic to spiritual. The issues they discuss include questions of faith and courage as well as everyday topics such as expressing gratitude and learning to listen. Throughout, they are constantly reminded of the power of books to comfort us, astonish us, teach us, and tell us what we need to do with our lives and in the world. Reading isn&#x2019;t the opposite of doing; it&#x2019;s the opposite of dying. <br><br> Will and Mary Anne share their hopes and concerns with each other&#x2014;and rediscover their lives&#x2014;through their favorite books. When they read, they aren&#x2019;t a sick person and a well person, but a mother and a son taking a journey together. The result is a profoundly moving tale of loss that is also a joyful, and often humorous, celebration of life: Will&#x2019;s love letter to his mother, and theirs to the printed page.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2012: </strong>Tissues at the ready, I braced myself for <em>The End of Your Life Book Club</em>, Will Schwalbe&#x2019;s memoir of his mother&#x2019;s death from pancreatic cancer. But Mary Anne Schwalbe is such a fierce, unsentimental heroine--and her son such a frank and funny storyteller--that what could have been an emotional roller coaster turns out to be a beautifully paced ride. Mary Anne loves a good book as ardently as she loves her kids and her causes, chief among them a campaign to build a library in Afghanistan. When her health starts to fail, Will joins her for hospital appointments. They wait, they talk, and they read together--everything they&#x2019;ve ever wanted to discuss. As much an homage to literature as to the mother who shared it with him, Will&#x2019;s chronicle of this heartrending time opens up his captivating family to the rest of us. We should all be so lucky as to read along with the Schwalbes. --<em>Mia Lipman</em></p> <p><b>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Will Schwalbe</b></p> <p>For twenty-one years I worked in book publishing, mostly in editorial, acquiring the rights to manuscripts, working with authors to help shape their works, and trying to convince the world to pay attention to the various, wonderful books we were publishing. I learned from some of the all time great editors and publishers. But part of my publishing education went way, way back &#x2013; to before I could read a word myself.</p> <p>When I was a young child, before I went to sleep, my mother, like so many parents, would read me a book. My brother, eighteen months older, got his own book read to him. Later, my sister, four years younger, would have her own. </p> <p>My mother was a working mother (a phrase she always disliked, as she rightly pointed out that no one talks of &#x201c;working fathers&#x201d;), so she wasn&#x2019;t always home at night. She sometimes worked late, and she travelled for business, and, even when she and my dad were in town, they occasionally were out for dinner. But if she was home, she read us each a book before bed.</p> <p>My early favorites included <em>The Story of Ferdinand</em> by Munro Leaf and <em>Harold and Purple Crayon</em> by Crockett Johnson. I loved that there was a bull who liked to smell flowers and wouldn&#x2019;t fight, and I was amazed by the boy who could draw himself out of any jam. But the experience was far more than the books themselves. First, there was the comfort and security of being tucked into bed. (Is it coincidence that we use the phrase &#x201c;tuck into&#x201d; before three of my favorite things: food, bed, and good books, or is it because the pleasures of each have so much in common?) Then, there was the happy, selfish knowledge that, when it was my turn, I would be able to monopolize my mother&#x2019;s attention just by sitting and listening.</p> <p>But what I remember most is the way Mom made us feel that she was sharing something she loved with us, not completing a chore or performing a ritual. (Though I&#x2019;m sure there were many nights when she was exhausted and would have loved to be in bed herself and fast asleep.) And when we shared the books, we also shared discussions about them. Why didn&#x2019;t the men understand that Ferdinand just didn&#x2019;t want to fight? There&#x2019;s no one answer, but it&#x2019;s a question Mom and I explored together time and again.</p> <p>Later, I would start to read to myself of course. But it was the nightly reading with Mom that helped me become a reader &#x2013; and probably pushed me toward the career in book publishing. From Mom, I learned that there&#x2019;s a public pleasure in books as well as a private one; that sharing books you love and getting others to read them can create a powerful bond, not just between a parent and child, but among thousands or millions of strangers.</p>Will Schwalbe has worked in publishing (most recently as senior vice president and editor in chief of Hyperion Books); digital media, as the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Cookstr.com; and as a journalist, writing for various publications including the <em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>South China Morning Post</em>.

It&#39;s a character study, a light mystery, and an entertaining look at a world that few people see up close. Campbell Scott is an inspired choice as narrator. His measured, understated tone captures the essence of the book, and he only slightly changes his for voice its characters. His leisurely pace draws our attention to the plot details and illuminates the author&#39;s asides about the art world.

Lasky and Knight join her in the treetops of Belize to record the wonders of plant and animal life found more than 100 feet above the ground. Yet, this book is not simply another chronicle of rain forest ecology, although the exceptional full-color photographs document with clarity the teeming life to be found there. Lasky also explains the methods scientists use to conduct research in this environment, sometimes under extremely difficult circumstances. For example, to gather leaf samples in Cameroon, Lowman had to hang over the edge of an inflatable raft suspended beneath a dirigible. In Belize, she uses walkways high above ground and, for the first time, allows her young sons to join her in the canopy. The long hours the scientist devotes to her work are not minimized, but her love for her research is evident. Her story might encourage young women considering science careers.

Reprint. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Julia Alvarez left the Dominican Republic for the United States in 1960 at the age of ten. A novelist, poet, and essayist, she is the author of nineteen books, including <i>How the Garc�a Girls Lost Their Accents,</i><i>In the Time of the Butterflies&#x2014;</i>a National Endowment for the Arts Big Read Selection&#x2014;<i>Yo!, Something to Declare, In the Name of Salome, Saving the</i><i>World, A Wedding in Haiti, </i>and <i>The Woman I Kept to Myself</i>. Her work has garnered wide recognition, including the 2013 National Medal of Arts, a Latina Leader Award in Literature in 2007 from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, the 2002 Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature, the 2000 Woman of the Year by <i>Latina</i> magazine, and inclusion in the New York Public Library&#x2019;s 1996 program &#x201c;The Hand of the Poet: Original Manuscripts by 100 Masters, from John Donne to Julia Alvarez.&#x201d; A writer-in-residence at Middlebury College, Alvarez and her husband, Bill Eichner, established Alta Gracia, an organic coffee farm&#x2013;literacy arts center, in her homeland, the Dominican Republic.Alvarez's poetic prose, with its rich, sensual detail, is brought perfectly to life by five readers. With expressive voices and accents that move adeptly between English and Spanish, they narrate the interwoven stories of four daughters of a wealthy family forced to leave the Dominican Republic and settle in the United States. Adjustment to immigrant life and its long-term consequences is explored with psychological astuteness from the point of view of each sister. Oddly, the narrators' voices are similar, making it difficult to distinguish among them, although this doesn't detract from the pleasures of listening. The rich detail, emotional depth, and fine narration make this a book that invites multiple listenings.

Mark Twain called it &#x201d;the best of any general's since Caesar.&#x201d; And few historians would disagree. Unquestionably, it is the finest literary achievement by any American president, the frankest, least pretentious, most nearly tragic account we have of the failings and triumphs of leadership.Written as Grant was dying of cancer, it tells the straightforward story of his boyhood in Ohio, graduation from West Point, and the grimy military campaigns in the West and Mexico that ended with his resignation in disgrace and a return to Galena where he ran the family store. Then began the rebellion that broke the Union and recast Grant's fortune: the capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the battles of Shiloh, Corinth, Appomattox, Five Forks, Sailor's Creek, Vicksburg and Lookout Mountain, the bloody Wilderness campaign, Sherman's &#x201d;March to the Sea,&#x201d;. Grant the tactician, the victim of his friends, the alcoholic, the plain and tough professional soldier, the ideal commander all of these images are brightened in the work of Grant the writer as he assesses himself and the events that forged his character.</p><p>In 1862, a prominent Republican visited President Lincoln and called General Ulysses S. Grant an incompetent drunk who created unnecessary political problems. Lincoln, frustrated with all his generals but this one, famously replied: "I can't spare this man; he fights." Indeed, Lincoln had gone through a series of unheroic generals before settling on Grant to lead the Union's Army of the Potomac. Grant's success at marshaling the industrial might of the North eventually pounded the South into submission. This memoir, finished as its author was dying of throat cancer in 1885, is widely admired for its clear and straightforward prose. The volume was an enormously popular hit upon publication (by Mark Twain, no less), and today <i>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant</i> ranks among the finest pieces of military autobiography ever written.These are in stock and ready for immediate shipment if you use the DSI4 Marketplace shop.

As soon as Pine Creek&#39;s new mystery man steps into her art gallery, Winter MacKeage is intrigued. This sexy stranger, Matt Gregor, wants her to do some drawings of his dream house. And with his tiger-gold eyes and masculine charm, he&#39;s impossible to resist. But so is Winter&#39;s Scottish heritage. As the seventh MacKeage daughter, she must embrace her true magical calling...and deny her mortal desires. Soon Winter is heating up -- in Matt&#39;s strong arms -- and her fiery heart is torn. Can she give up the destiny she was born to fulfill for the only man she&#39;s ever truly loved?</p><p>A native of rural central Maine, Janet Chapman (1956&#x2013;2017) lived in a cozy log cabin on a lake with her husband, three cats, and a stay young bull moose. The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also wrote numerous contemporary romances.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> Winter MacKeage lost the thread of the conversation the moment the large male figure stepped into view. Rose continued talking, however, oblivious to the fact that the most gorgeous man ever to set foot in Pine Creek had just stopped to look at the painting hanging in the front window of Winter's art gallery. </p><p> "Tell her I'm right," Rose demanded, nudging Winter's arm. "Tell Megan that no one is whispering behind her back. Hey," Rose said more loudly, grabbing Winter's sleeve to draw her back into the conversation. "Your sister thinks everyone in town pities her." </p><p> Winter looked away from the divine apparition in the window and blinked at Rose and her sister, Megan, trying to remember what they had been talking about. </p><p> Rose sighed. "Darn it, Winter, help me out here. Tell Megan she's not the center of town gossip." </p><p> Winter finally looked into her sister's tear-washed eyes. "Oh, but everyone is talking about you, Meg," she said, nodding. "But only because you walk down the street looking like a rag doll that's been left out in the rain all summer." </p><p> "That's not helping," Rose snapped, using her grip on Winter's sleeve to nudge her. </p><p> Winter stepped away, crossed her arms under her breasts, and ignored Rose in favor of glaring at Megan. "You always have such a long face, it's a wonder you don't trip on your own chin. You scuffle along like a beaten puppy." Winter reached out and touched her sister's hunched shoulder. "Pregnancy is not a disease, Meg," she continued more gently. "Nor is it the end of the world. The only one pitying you around here is you. And if you don't soon quit, your bairn will be born with a permanent pout." </p><p> Megan MacKeage swiped at her flushed face and met Winter's tender smile with a fierce glare. "You can say that when your heart gets broken," Megan hissed, "and you come running home because the love of your life walked out when you told him you're having his baby." </p><p> Winter took hold of Megan's shoulders and leaned close. "I love you, Meg. Mama and Papa love you. Rose loves you. Everyone here in Pine Creek loves you. That one stupid jerk in a thousand loving people doesn't is not worth what you're putting yourself through. Wayne Ferris is a conniving weasel who's too stupid to appreciate what a wonderful woman you are. You have to let him go, Meg, and focus on your child. Being depressed and crying all the time will make your unborn bairn think you don't want it." </p><p> Megan moved her gaze past Winter's shoulder, looking at nothing, her lower lip quivering and her eyes misting again. "I thought he loved me," she whispered, looking back at Winter through eyes filled with despair. "He said he loved me." </p><p> "He loved what you could do for his career," Winter told her just as softly, gently squeezing her shoulders. "But camping out on the tundra for months at a time does not mix well with babies. That Wayne chose -- " </p><p> The tiny bell on the gallery door tinkled, drawing everyone's attention. Just as Winter began to turn, she noticed that Rose was staring at the door in utter disbelief. Megan's eyes had gone equally as wide, her jaw slack. Winter spun fully around and actually took a step back. Who wouldn't feel a punch in the gut when finding herself in the presence of such incredibly virile... maleness? The man was just too stunning for words. </p><p> Which seemed to be an immediate problem for Winter, as she couldn't even respond when the tall, handsome stranger nodded at her -- though she did hear Rose sigh, and she did feel Megan poke her in the back. </p><p> "Ah, may I help you?" Winter finally said. </p><p> Enigmatic, tiger gold eyes met hers, and it took all of Winter's willpower not to take another step back. The man was standing just inside her spacious gallery, yet he seemed to fill up the entire space. </p><p> "Is the painting in the window by a local artist?" he asked. </p><p> The deep, rich timbre of his voice sent a shudder coursing through Winter, and another sharp poke in her back started her breathing again. "Ah, yes," she said. "She lives right here in Pine Creek." Winter waved a hand at the east wall of her gallery. "Most of the paintings are hers. Everything we sell is by local artists," she finished in a near whisper, unable to stop staring at his beautifully rugged, tanned face. </p><p> He simply stared back, his eyes crinkled in amusement. </p><p> "Feel free to look around," she added with another halfhearted wave, thankful that her voice sounded normal this time. "I can answer any questions you have." </p><p> "Thank you," he said with a slight nod, before turning to the wall of paintings. </p><p> As soon as he looked away, Winter spun around to face Megan and Rose. Neither woman noticed her warning glare, however, as they were too busy gawking at the man. Worried that he'd turn around and catch them, Winter grabbed them both by an arm and hustled them ahead of her into the back room. </p><p> "Cut it out," she quietly hissed. "You're being rude." </p><p> "Did you see how broad his shoulders are?" Rose whispered, craning around to look back at the gallery. </p><p> Winter moved the three of them farther away from the door. "Rose Dolan Brewer, you're a happily married woman with two kids. You shouldn't be noticing other men's shoulders." </p><p> Rose smiled. "I can still look, as long as I don't touch." </p><p> "Did you see his hair?" Megan whispered, her eyes still wide, not a trace of a tear anywhere in sight. "He's wearing a suit that probably cost more than my entire wardrobe, but he's got a ponytail. What sort of businessman has long hair?" </p><p> "And those eyes," Rose interjected before Winter could respond. "They're as rich as gold bullion. My knees went weak when he looked at you, Winter." </p><p> "That does it. Out," Winter said, crowding them toward the door that connected the back office of her gallery with Dolan's Outfitter Store. "You're going to scare off my most promising customer today." </p><p> Rose snorted and stepped into her store, combing her fingers through her short brown hair. "I doubt anything could scare that man," she muttered, smoothing down her blouse as she turned to Winter. "Send him over to my store after," she said with a cheeky grin. "I'll, ah... fit him into more suitable clothes for around here." </p><p> "Do you suppose he came in on that plane that flew over?" Megan asked. "We saw it bank for a landing at the airport. It looked like a private jet." Megan sighed. "My God, he's handsome. Maybe I should stay and help you set out the figures Talking Tom brought in this afternoon." </p><p> Winter didn't have the heart to remind Megan that she had sworn off men -- handsome or otherwise -- when she'd come home from her fieldwork in Canada last month, abandoned and two months pregnant. It was rather nice to see her sister's face flushed from something other than tears. </p><p> "Thanks," Winter said with a tender smile, "but I think I'll wait and put out Tom's carvings tomorrow." </p><p> Megan took one last look toward the gallery door, sighed, then followed Rose down the aisle of camping equipment. Winter softly closed the connecting door, ran her fingers through her own mass of long red curls, straightened to her full five-foot-six height with a calming breath, and headed back into the gallery. </p><p> Mr. Tiger Eyes was still facing the wall. He had worked his way down the wall to a painting hanging toward the front of the store, his arms folded over his broad chest and his chin resting on one of his large, tanned fists. The pose pulled the material of his expensive suit tightly across a set of impressively wide shoulders. He glanced only casually at Winter when she stepped up to the counter, then went back to studying the painting. </p><p> He was looking at a large watercolor she had painted last spring, which she had titled Moon Watchers. It was a nighttime scene set deep in a mountain forest awash with moonlight. Three young bear cubs were gathered around a thick old tree stump, their harried mother catching a quick nap as they played in the shadows. One of the cubs was perched precariously on top of the stump, its tiny snout raised skyward as it brayed at the large silver disk in the star-studded sky, its siblings watching with enchanted expressions on their moon-bathed faces. And if one studied the painting long enough, he or she would eventually notice all of the other nocturnal creatures hidden in the shadows, curiously watching the young bears in the moonlight. </p><p> It was a painting that usually drew the attention of women more than men, with its endearingly familial subject and somewhat playful and mystical mood. </p><p> Winter slid her gaze to the man standing in front of it. </p><p> He was at least as tall as her cousin Robbie MacBain, and Robbie was six-foot-seven in his stocking feet. This man's shoulders were equally as broad, his legs as long and muscled beneath that perfectly tailored suit, his hands just as large and blunt and powerful looking. He had the body of an athlete, which said that whoever he was, he didn't spend all of his time sitting in boardrooms or shuffling papers. </p><p> Like Megan, Winter found herself questioning his choice of hairstyle if he truly was the successful businessman he appeared to be. His soft brown hair was thick and smooth, neatly brushed off his face and tied at the nape of his neck with a thin piece of leather. It wasn't overlong; Winter guessed that when loose, it would just brush his shoulders. </p><p> She suddenly realized she was staring just as rudely as Megan and Rose had been. With a silent sigh, Winter dropped her gaze to the small piece of paper that Tom had tossed down on the counter when he'd brought in his latest batch of wooden figures. It was a short list, Winter realized as she tried to focus on something other than her customer. Only five carvings this time, written in very neat, tiny black letters. </p><p> The first figure on the list was a chipmunk, and Tom had written one hundred and fifty dollars beside it. Next was a fox that he'd priced at two hundred. Then a swimming trout at four hundred dollars, and a snowy owl at two hundred. </p><p> Winter smiled at the last figure listed -- crow tending young in nest -- priced at twelve hundred dollars. </p></p><h2>Slapstick</h2><p>Wilbur Swain and his twin sister, Eliza, are so immensely hideous, helpless and vile in their infancy that their wealthy parents are forced to send them to live on a nearby asteroid. But behind their facade of idiocy, the monstrous pair possess a joint intelligence that could outstrip the most advanced computers...</p><p>Dr. Wilbur Daffodil-11 Swain, centenarian, the last President of the United States, King of Manhattan, and one-half (along with his sister, Eliza) of the most powerful intelligence since Einstein, is penning his autobiography. He occupies the first floor of a ruined Empire State Building and lives like a royal scavenger with his illiterate granddaughter and her beau. Buffeted by fluctuating gravity, the U.S. has been scourged by not one, but two lethal diseases: the Green Death and the Albanian Flu. Consequently, the country has fallen into civil war. (Super-intelligent, miniaturized Chinese watch the West self-destruct from the sidelines.) Swain stayed at the White House until there were no citizens left to govern, then moved to deserted New York City, where he writes a thoughtful missive before death. <p> In <i>Slapstick</i>, Vonnegut muses on war, man's hubris, and the awful, crippling loneliness humans are freighted with--but, miraculously, the book still manages to delight and amuse. Absurd, knowing, never depressing, <i>Slapstick</i> kindles hope--for the possibility of wisdom, perhaps; for human resiliency, surely. </p><p> It's best to end with a quote from the prologue wherein the author discourses on The Meaning of It All, or at least This Book: "Love is where you find it. I think it is foolish to go off looking for it, and I think it can often be poisonous. <br> I wish that people who are conventionally supposed to love each other would say to each other, when they fight, 'Please--a little less love, and a little more common decency.'" <br> Amen.</p>Slapstick presents an apocalyptic vision seen through the eyes of the current King of Manhattan (and last President of the United States), a wickedly irreverent look at the all-too-possible results of today's follies. But even the end of life-as-we-know-it is transformed by Vonnegut's pen into hilarious farce--a final slapstick that may be the Almighty's joke on us all.<p></p><p>"Vonnegut's ongoing puppet show. . .the fabulous is reborn."--John Updike, <i>The New Yorker.</i></p><p></p><p> "Imaginative and hilarious... a brilliant vision of wrecked, wacked-out future!" --<i>Hartford Courant</i></p></p><h2>The Night Crew (Prey)</h2><p>Roaming the night streets of Los Angeles in search of news items for their cameras, Anna Hatory and her crew of video freelancers are shattered by the death of a suicidal jumper and the murder of one of their team members, a crime that bares dangerous secrets from the past. BOMC Main.</p><p>Anna Batory's evening starts with a frenzied animal rights raid and then moves quickly to the site of a suicide jump. It's all in a normal night's work for Anna, who leads the Night Crew, a freelance video team out to make a quick buck on sensational footage they can sell to L.A. news stations. But this night is different: the jumper is a teenager named Jacob Harper, and Anna's cameraman Jason beats a strangely hasty exit after filming the jump. A few hours later, Jason too is dead: shot and knifed.<p> Jacob Harper's father is an attractive former cop who works out the connection between his son's death and Jason's. The two young men share a drug dealer--and when Harper finds said dealer dead as well, he calls Anna to the scene and shows her a creepy knife wound on the dealer's body: the name "Anna" carved into his chest. From that moment on, Anna knows she's chasing down a killer who's got a thing for her--but who is it? A series of heart-thumping encounters between Anna and her shadowy stalker keep this thriller moving at the dizzying clip that Sandford's fans expect.</p><p> Those who love the Prey series for the quirks and contradictions of its antihero, Lucas Davenport, will find a kindred creation in Anna: an attractive loner, taciturn and tough-minded, a classical pianist with the fighting reflexes of a wild animal. Will Sandford keep bringing her back? Time will tell. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p><strong>John Sandford</strong> is the pseudonym of Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist John Camp.

They have spoken the words of the enemy. And those words hold them in bondage. Proverbs 6:1-2 says, "...Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth." </p><p>Faith-filled words will put you over. </p><p>Fear-filled words will defeat you. </p><p>Words are the most powerful thing in the universe. </p><p>Man is a spirit being, very capable of operating on the same level of faith as God. We read in Mark 9:23, "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." Matthew 17:20 says, "And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you." Mark 11:23 says, "For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith." </p><p>Spiritual Law </p><p>This is not theory. It is fact. It is spiritual law. It works every time it is applied correctly. This is A SPIRITUAL LAW. God never does anything without saying it first. God is a faith God. God released His faith in Words. "And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God" (Mark 11:22). A more literal translation of the above verse says, "Have the God kind of faith, or faith of God." </p><p>Ephesians 5:1 literally tells us to be imitators of God as children imitate their parents. </p><p>To imitate God, you must talk like Him and act like Him. </p><p>He would not ask you to do something you are not capable of doing. </p><p>Jesus operated in the faith principles of Mark 11:23 and Matthew 17:20 while He was on earth. He spoke to the wind and sea. He spoke to demons. He spoke to the fig tree. He even spoke to dead men. </p><p>The wind, sea, tree, demons, and even the dead were obedient to what He said. </p><p>He operated in the God kind of faith. </p><p>God is a faith God. God released His faith in Words. </p><p>Jesus was imitating His Father and getting the same results as His Father. </p><p>In John 14:12 Jesus said, "...He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also; and greater...." </p><p>These principles of faith are based on spiritual laws. </p><p>They work for whosoever will apply these laws. </p><p>You set them in motion by the words of your mouth. </p><p>Do you really want all the negative things you have been confessing to come to pass? Are you believing for those things? </p><p>If Jesus came to you personally and said, from this day forward it will come to pass, that everything you say will happen exactly as you say it; would that change your vocabulary? </p><p>I believe it would. </p><p>Binding and Loosing </p><p>In Matthew 16:19 Jesus said, "I give you the keys of the kingdom, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." </p><p>Psalm 119:89 tells us, "For ever O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven." What God said is already established. </p><p>Now it is up to you. What are you going to say about it? </p><p>God will not alter what He has said. "My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips" (Ps. 89:34). </p><p>Whose words will you establish on earth? </p><p>The power of binding and loosing is on earth. </p><p>Spoken Words </p><p>Spoken words program your spirit (heart) either to success or defeat. Words are containers. They carry faith, or fear, and they produce after their kind. </p><p>"So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God" (Rom. 10:17). Faith comes more quickly when you hear yourself quoting, speaking, and saying the things God said. You will more readily receive God&#x2019;s Word into your spirit by hearing yourself say it than if you hear someone else say it.</p></p><h2>Polar the Titanic Bear</h2><p>A story of a boy, his teddy bear, and their escape the Titanic&#39;s sinking, originally told to the boy by his mother shortly after their family&#39;s escape from that tragedy, features beautiful illustrations and a fascinating glimpse into the past.</p><p>Imagine the excitement of rooting around in an old attic and discovering the letters, diaries, and photo albums of a relative.

Soon the boy and bear are inseparable! As the wealthy Speddens are world travelers, Polar and his new family sail from New York to Algiers and on to the French Riviera, until it comes time for them to return to America on the <i>Titanic</i>. On the fateful night of the sinking, Polar and the Speddens are lucky enough to be lowered down the side of the luxury liner in a lifeboat, but when the family boards the rescue ship, Polar finds himself left behind! How will Polar make it back to his best friend? </p><p> In the epilogue, rich with family photographs, the historical context for the story is fully and engagingly explained, with more details on the <i>Titanic</i> disaster as well as a smattering of toy history. This is a wonderful gift book--the richness and emotion of the story are all the more poignant when enhanced by the Spedden family photographs, their tragic personal story, and the reflection of an era that will never exist again. (All ages ... excellent for reading aloud to ages 6 and older, but perfect for 9- to 12-year-olds, too.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Daisy Corning Stone Spedden penned the manuscript for <i>Polar, The Titanic Bear</i> for her son, Douglas, after the family survived the Titanic disaster in 1912. The original booklet was found, among other items, by Leighton H. Coleman III, a distant relation of the Spedden family, in his grandfather's barn. After sending a copy of the story to the Titanic Historical Society, it came to the attention of Madison Press Books, who eventually published the story with Little, Brown and Company.<br>Laurie McGaw is well known for her portraits of renowned figures as well as her award-winning illustrations in <i>Polar The Titanic Bear </i>and <i>African Princess</i>.

Here, Kathleen catches the eye of the city's most eligible bachelor, Dylan Francis Kennedy, and the two are instantly attracted to each other. Fate intervenes when the two are caught in the midst of the great Chicago Fire of 1871 and, convinced they're about to die, they impulsively marry. Amazingly they survive, and Kathleen is faced with the difficult task of confessing her real identity to her new husband. To her shock, she learns that Dylan is also a fraud. Far from being a rich gentleman, he's a con artist, intent on marrying an heiress and taking her money.</p><p> How will the Irish maid and the gambler deal with being tied together in a marriage that began with deception? They've escaped death in the Great Chicago Fire, but can they survive the bonds of matrimony and the very real threat to their hearts? Especially when Kathleen is determined to reform him and Dylan is just as determined to separate marks from their money in this tale of dangerous games and wild adventure.</p><p> In this second installment of the trilogy that began with <i>The Hostage</i>, Susan Wiggs creates a classic love story of a flawed hero who learns the meaning of love through trial, travail, and the passionate heart of a good woman. The story expertly meshes the high drama of a city ablaze and the lively action of a great con game, adds an equal slice of 1870's historical ambiance, and tops it all with expertly drawn characters. Wiggs just keeps getting better and better. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p>When Susan Wiggs's recent novel, <i>Fireside</i>, landed at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list, the author responded by jumping fully clothed into her swimming pool.

Now, in this compelling new work, he ad-dresses an equally important issue: our craving for significance, the need to know that our lives and our choices mean something.<br>We sometimes do great things, and sometimes terrible things, to reassure ourselves that we matter to the world. We sometimes confuse fame, power, and wealth with true achievement. But finally we need to think of ourselves as good people, and we are troubled when we compromise our integrity in the pursuit of what we think of as success.<br><br>Harold Kushner tells us that the path to a truly successful and significant life is through friendship, through family, and through acts of generosity and self-sacrifice. He describes how, in affecting the life <br>of even one person in a positive way, we make a difference in the world, and prove that we do in fact matter.<br>Persuasive and sympathetic, anecdotal and commonsensical, <i>Living a Life That Matters</i> inspires and uplifts.</p><p>A person's longing for significance--which can lead to excessive ambition, moral compromise, and preoccupation with status--often stands in conflict with a longing to be good. In <i>Living a Life That Matters</i>, Harold S. Kushner (the Massachusetts rabbi whose bestselling books include <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i>) suggests that the most successful lives are the ones that most effectively manage and resolve that conflict. For example, Kushner retells the biblical story of Jacob, in a chapter whose lesson is named by its title, "How to Win By Losing." Hamlet, Dirty Harry, and Exodus are a few of the dozens of examples he cites while elaborating on the essential lesson of this book: that success and significance converge in every act of love, generosity, and self-sacrifice that we make for our families, friends, and communities. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><br>"<i>Living a Life That Matters </i>is a wonderful, much-needed primer on the truly important things in life. Many thanks to Harold Kushner for reminding us what we should never forget: that success is not in the bulk of your wallet, but in the weight of your character."<br> --Mitch Albom, author of <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i><br> <i><br></i>"Rabbi Kushner's new book is full of the great stories and subtle wisdom that makes him a genuine spiritual leader for us all in a time of considerable confusion. He blends limitless compassion with sharp analysis to offer a way toward integrity. This is a book you don't want to put down or allow to be too far from you in times of crisis."<br> --Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul</i></p><h2>Love Is in the Earth: Kaleidoscopic Pictorial Supplement Z</h2><p>Over 120 NEW Minerals with photographs, and updated old minerals.

In <i>Turing&#x2019;s Cathedral</i>, George Dyson focuses on a small group of men and women, led by John von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, who built one of the first computers to realize Alan Turing&#x2019;s vision of a Universal Machine. Their work would break the distinction between numbers that <i>mean</i> things and numbers that <i>do</i> things&#x2014;and our universe would never be the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>Using five kilobytes of memory (the amount allocated to displaying the cursor on a computer desktop of today), they achieved unprecedented success in both weather prediction and nuclear weapons design, while tackling, in their spare time, problems ranging from the evolution of viruses to the evolution of stars.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dyson&#x2019;s account, both historic and prophetic, sheds important new light on how the digital universe exploded in the aftermath of World War II. The proliferation of both codes and machines was paralleled by two historic developments: the decoding of self-replicating sequences in biology and the invention of the hydrogen bomb. It&#x2019;s no coincidence that the most destructive and the most constructive of human inventions appeared at exactly the same time. <br>&nbsp;<br>How did code take over the world? In retracing how Alan Turing&#x2019;s one-dimensional model became John von Neumann&#x2019;s two-dimensional implementation, <i>Turing&#x2019;s Cathedral</i> offers a series of provocative suggestions as to where the digital universe, now fully three-dimensional, may be heading next.</p></p><p><p><b>George Dyson</b> is a historian of technology whose interests include the development (and redevelopment) of the Aleut kayak (<i>Baidarka),</i> the evolution of digital computing and telecommunications<i> (Darwin Among the Machines),</i> and the exploration of space <i>(Project Orion).</i></p><p><b><i>Preface</i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>POINT SOURCE SOLUTION<br>&nbsp;<br><i>I am thinking about something much more important than bombs. I am thinking about computers. </i><br>&#x2014;John von Neumann, 1946 <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There are two kinds of creation myths: those where life arises out of the mud, and those where life falls from the sky. In this creation myth, computers arose from the mud, and code fell from the sky. <br>&nbsp;<br>In late 1945, at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, Hungarian American mathematician John von Neumann gathered a small group of engineers to begin designing, building, and programming an electronic digital computer, with five kilobytes of storage, whose attention could be switched in 24 microseconds from one memory location to the next. The entire digital universe can be traced directly to this 32-by-32-by-40-bit nucleus: less memory than is allocated to displaying a single icon on a computer screen today. <br>&nbsp;<br>Von Neumann&#x2019;s project was the physical realization of Alan Turing&#x2019;s Universal Machine, a theoretical construct invented in 1936. It was not the first computer. It was not even the second or third computer. It was, however, among the first computers to make full use of a high-speed random-access storage matrix, and became the machine whose coding was most widely replicated and whose logical architecture was most widely reproduced. The stored-program computer, as conceived by Alan Turing and delivered by John von Neumann, broke the distinction between numbers that <i>mean</i> things and numbers that <i>do</i> things. Our universe would never be the same. <br>&nbsp;<br>Working outside the bounds of industry, breaking the rules of academia, and relying largely on the U.S. government for support, a dozen engineers in their twenties and thirties designed and built von Neumann&#x2019;s computer for less than $1 million in under five years. &#x201c;He was in the right place at the right time with the right connections with the right idea,&#x201d; remembers Willis Ware, fourth to be hired to join the engineering team, &#x201c;setting aside the hassle that will probably never be resolved as to whose ideas they really were.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As World War II drew to a close, the scientists who had built the atomic bomb at Los Alamos wondered, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s next?&#x201d; Some, including Richard Feynman, vowed never to have anything to do with nuclear weapons or military secrecy again. Others, including Edward Teller and John von Neumann, were eager to develop more advanced nuclear weapons, especially the &#x201c;Super,&#x201d; or hydrogen bomb. Just before dawn on the morning of July 16, 1945, the New Mexico desert was illuminated by an explosion &#x201c;brighter than a thousand suns.&#x201d; Eight and a half years later, an explosion one thousand times more powerful illuminated the skies over Bikini Atoll. The race to build the hydrogen bomb was accelerated by von Neumann&#x2019;s desire to build a computer, and the push to build von Neumann&#x2019;s computer was accelerated by the race to build a hydrogen bomb. <br>&nbsp;<br>Computers were essential to the initiation of nuclear explosions, and to understanding what happens next. In &#x201c;Point Source Solution,&#x201d; a 1947 Los Alamos report on the shock waves produced by nuclear explosions, von Neumann explained that &#x201c;for very violent explosions . . . it may be justified to treat the original, central, high pressure area as a point.&#x201d; This approximated the physical reality of a nuclear explosion closely enough to enable some of the first useful predictions of weapons effects. <br>&nbsp;<br>Numerical simulation of chain reactions within computers initiated a chain reaction among computers, with machines and codes proliferating as explosively as the phenomena they were designed to help us understand. It is no coincidence that the most destructive and the most constructive of human inventions appeared at exactly the same time. Only the collective intelligence of computers could save us from the destructive powers of the weapons they had allowed us to invent. <br>&nbsp;<br>Turing&#x2019;s model of universal computation was one-dimensional: a string of symbols encoded on a tape. Von Neumann&#x2019;s implementation of Turing&#x2019;s model was two-dimensional: the address matrix underlying all computers in use today. The landscape is now three-dimensional, yet the entire Internet can still be viewed as a common tape shared by a multitude of Turing&#x2019;s Universal Machines. <br>&nbsp;<br>Where does time fit in? Time in the digital universe and time in our universe are governed by entirely different clocks. In our universe, time is a continuum. In a digital universe, time (T) is a countable number of discrete, sequential steps. A digital universe is bounded at the beginning, when T = 0, and at the end, if T comes to a stop. Even in a perfectly deterministic universe, there is no consistent method to predict the ending in advance. To an observer in our universe, the digital universe appears to be speeding up. To an observer in the digital universe, our universe appears to be slowing down.<br>&nbsp;<br>Universal codes and universal machines, introduced by Alan Turing in his &#x201c;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#x201d; of 1936, have prospered to such an extent that Turing&#x2019;s underlying interest in the &#x201c;decision problem&#x201d; is easily overlooked. In answering the <i>Entscheidungsproblem, </i>Turing proved that there is no systematic way to tell, by looking at a code, what that code will do. That&#x2019;s what makes the digital universe so interesting, and that&#x2019;s what brings us here. <br>&nbsp;<br>It is impossible to predict where the digital universe is going, but it is possible to understand how it began. The origin of the first fully electronic random-access storage matrix, and the propagation of the codes that it engendered, is as close to a point source as any approximation can get.</p></p><h2>Call Power: 21 Days To Conquering Call Reluctance</h2><p>This book if studied and applied with purpose and vision can empower you and your organization beyond what you ever thought possible.

Centro de Reubicaci�n Novilla, says the sign. Reubicaci�n: what does that mean? Not a word he has learned. The office is large and empty. Hot too &#x2013; even hotter than outside. ?tioned by panes of frosted glass. Against the wall is an array of filing drawers in varnished wood. Suspended over one of the partitions is a sign: Reci�n Llegados, the words stencilled in black on a rectangle of cardboard. The clerk behind the counter, a young woman, greets him with a smile. &#x2018;Good day,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;We are new arrivals.&#x2019; He articulates the words slowly, in the Spanish he has worked hard to master. &#x2018;I am looking for employment, also for a place to live.&#x2019; He grips the boy under the armpits and lifts him so that she can see him properly. &#x2018;I have a child with me.&#x2019; The girl reaches out to take the boy&#x2019;s hand. &#x2018;Hello, young man!&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;He is your grandson?&#x2019; &#x2018;Not my grandson, not my son, but I am responsible for him.&#x2019; &#x2018;A place to live.&#x2019; She glances at her papers. &#x2018;We have a room free here at the Centre that you can use while you look for something better. It won&#x2019;t be luxurious, but perhaps you won&#x2019;t mind that. As for employment, let us explore that in the morning &#x2013; you look tired, I am sure you want to rest. Have you travelled far?&#x2019; &#x2018;We have been on the road all week. We have come from Belstar, from the camp. Are you familiar with Belstar?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes, I know Belstar well. I came through Belstar myself. Is that where you learned your Spanish?&#x2019; &#x2018;We had lessons every day for six weeks.&#x2019; &#x2018;Six weeks? You are lucky. I was in Belstar for three months. I almost perished of boredom. The only thing that kept me going was the Spanish lessons. Did you by any chance have se�ora Pi�era as a teacher?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, our teacher was a man.&#x2019; He hesitates. &#x2018;May I raise a different matter? My boy&#x2019; &#x2013; he glances at the child &#x2013; &#x2018;is not well. Partly it is because he is upset, confused and upset, and hasn&#x2019;t been eating prop?erly. He found the food in the camp strange, didn&#x2019;t like it. Is there anywhere we can get a proper meal?&#x2019; &#x2018;How old is he?&#x2019; &#x2018;Five. That is the age he was given.&#x2019; &#x2018;And you say he is not your grandson.&#x2019; &#x2018;Not my grandson, not my son. We are not related. Here&#x2019; &#x2013; he takes the two passbooks from his pocket and proffers them. She inspects the passbooks. &#x2018;These were issued in Belstar?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes. That is where they gave us our names, our Spanish names.&#x2019; She leans over the counter. &#x2018;David &#x2013; that&#x2019;s a nice name,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Do you like your name, young man?&#x2019; The boy regards her levelly but does not reply. What does she see? A slim, pale-faced child wearing a woollen coat buttoned to the throat, grey shorts covering his knees, black lace-up boots over woollen socks, and a cloth cap at a slant. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you find those clothes very hot? Would you like to take off your coat?&#x2019; The boy shakes his head. He intervenes. &#x2018;The clothes are from Belstar. He chose them himself, from what they had to offer. He has become quite attached to them.&#x2019; &#x2018;I understand. I asked because he seemed a bit warmly dressed for a day like today. Let me mention: we have a depository here at the Centre where people donate clothing that their children have outgrown. It is open every morning on weekdays. You are welcome to help yourself. You will find more variety than at Belstar.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Also, once you have filled in all the necessary forms you can draw money on your passbook. You have a settlement allowance of four hundred reals. The boy too. Four hundred each.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Now let me show you to your room.&#x2019; She leans across and whis?pers to the woman at the next counter, the counter labelled Trabajos. The woman pulls open a drawer, rummages in it, shakes her head. &#x2018;A slight hitch,&#x2019; says the girl. &#x2018;We don&#x2019;t seem to have the key to your room. It must be with the building supervisor. The supervisor&#x2019;s name is se�ora Weiss. Go to Building C. I will draw you a map. When you find se�ora Weiss, ask her to give you the key to C-55. Tell her that Ana from the main office sent you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be easier to give us another room?&#x2019; &#x2018;Unfortunately C-55 is the only room that is free.&#x2019; &#x2018;And food?&#x2019; &#x2018;Food?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes. Is there somewhere we can eat?&#x2019; &#x2018;Again, speak to se�ora Weiss. She should be able to help you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank you. One last question: Are there organizations here that specialize in bringing people together?&#x2019; &#x2018;Bringing people together?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes. There must surely be many people searching for family members. Are there organizations that help to bring families together &#x2013; families, friends, lovers?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, I&#x2019;ve never heard of such an organization.&#x2019; Partly because he is tired and disoriented, partly because the map the girl has sketched for him is not clear, partly because there are no signposts, it takes him a long time to find Building C and the office of se�ora Weiss. The door is closed. He knocks. There is no reply. He stops a passer-by, a tiny woman with a pointy, mouse-like face wearing the chocolate-coloured uniform of the Centre. &#x2018;I am looking for se�ora Weiss,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;She&#x2019;s off,&#x2019; says the young woman, and when he does not understand:: &#x2018;Off for the day. Come back in the morning.&#x2019; &#x2018;Then perhaps you can help us. We are looking for the key to room C-55.&#x2019; The young woman shakes her head. &#x2018;Sorry, I don&#x2019;t handle keys.&#x2019; They make their way back to the Centro de Reubicaci�n. The door is locked. He raps on the glass. There is no sign of life inside. He raps again. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m thirsty,&#x2019; whines the boy. &#x2018;Hang on just a little longer,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;I will look for a tap.&#x2019; The girl, Ana, appears around the side of the building. &#x2018;Were you knocking?&#x2019; she says. Again he is struck: by her youth, by the health and freshness that radiate from her. &#x2018;Se�ora Weiss seems to have gone home,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;Is there not something you can do? Do you not have a &#x2013; what do you call it? &#x2013; a llave universal to open our room?&#x2019; &#x2018;Llave maestra. There is no such thing as a llave universal. If we had a llave universal all our troubles would be over. No, se�ora Weiss is the only one with a llave maestra for Building C. Do you perhaps have a friend who can put you up for the night? Then you can come back in the morning and speak to se�ora Weiss.&#x2019; &#x2018;A friend who can put us up? We arrived on these shores six weeks ago, since when we have been living in a tent in a camp out in the desert. How can you expect us to have friends here who will put us up?&#x2019; Ana frowns. &#x2018;Go to the main gate,&#x2019; she orders. &#x2018;Wait for me outside the gate. I will see what I can do.&#x2019; They pass through the gate, cross the street, and sit down in the shade of a tree. The boy nestles his head on his shoulder. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m thirsty,&#x2019; he complains. &#x2018;When are you going to find a tap?&#x2019; &#x2018;Hush,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;Listen to the birds.&#x2019; They listen to the strange birdsong, feel the strange wind on their skins. Ana emerges. He stands up and waves. The boy gets to his feet too, arms stiffly by his sides, thumbs clenched in his fists. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve brought some water for your son,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Here, David, drink.&#x2019; The child drinks, gives the cup back to her. She puts it in her bag. &#x2018;Was that good?&#x2019; she asks. &#x2018;Yes.&#x2019; &#x2018;Good. Now follow me. It&#x2019;s quite a walk, but you can look on it as exercise.&#x2019; Swiftly she strides along the track across the parkland. An attrac�tive young woman, no denying that, though the clothes she wears hardly become her: a dark, shapeless skirt, a white blouse tight at the throat, flat shoes. By himself he might be able to keep up with her, but with the child in his arms he cannot. He calls out: &#x2018;Please &#x2013; not so fast!&#x2019; She ignores him. At an ever-increasing distance he follows her across the park, across a street, across a second street. Before a narrow, plain-looking house she pauses and waits. &#x2018;This is my place,&#x2019; she says. She unlocks the front door. &#x2018;Follow me.&#x2019; She leads them down a dim corridor, through a back door, down rickety wooden stairs, into a small yard overgrown with grass and weeds, enclosed on two sides by a wooden fence and on the third by chain-link wire. &#x2018;Have a seat,&#x2019; she says, indicating a rusty cast-iron chair half covered in grass. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll get you something to eat.&#x2019; He has no wish to sit. He and the boy wait by the door. The girl re-emerges bearing a plate and a pitcher. The pitcher holds water. The plate holds four slices of bread spread with margarine. It is exactly what they had for breakfast at the charity station. &#x2018;As a new arrival you are legally required to reside in approved lodgings, or else at the Centre,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;But it will be all right if you spend your first night here. Since I am employed at the Centre, we can argue that my home counts as approved lodging.&#x2019; &#x2018;That&#x2019;s very kind of you, very generous,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;There are some leftover building materials in that corner.&#x2019; She points. &#x2018;You can make yourself a shelter, if you like. Shall I leave you to it?&#x2019; He stares at her, nonplussed. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not sure I understand,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;Where exactly will we be spending the night?&#x2019; &#x2018;Here.&#x2019; She indicates the yard. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll come back in a while and see how you are getting on.&#x2019; The building materials in question are half a dozen sheets of galva�nized iron, rusted through in places &#x2013; old roofing, no doubt &#x2013; and some odds and ends of timber. Is this a test? Does she really mean that he and the child should sleep out in the open? He waits for her prom�ised return, but she does not come. He tries the back door: it is locked. He knocks; there is no response. What is going on? Is she behind the curtains, watching to see how he will react? They are not prisoners. It would be an easy matter to scale the wire fence and make off. Is that what they should do; or should he wait and see what will happen next? He waits. By the time she reappears the sun is setting. &#x2018;You haven&#x2019;t done much,&#x2019; she remarks, frowning. &#x2018;Here.&#x2019; She hands him a bottle of water, a hand towel, a roll of toilet paper; and, when he looks at her questioningly: &#x2018;No one will see you.&#x2019; &#x2018;I have changed my mind,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;We will go back to the Centre. There must be a public room where we can spend the night.&#x2019; &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t do that. The gates at the Centre are closed. They close at six.&#x2019; Exasperated, he strides over to the stack of roofing, drags out two sheets, and leans them at an angle against the wooden fence. He does the same with third and fourth sheets, making a rude lean-to. &#x2018;Is that what you have in mind for us?&#x2019; he says, turning to her. But she is gone. &#x2018;This is where we are going to sleep tonight,&#x2019; he tells the boy. &#x2018;It will be an adventure.&#x2019; &#x2018;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x2019; says the boy. &#x2018;You haven&#x2019;t eaten your bread.&#x2019; &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like bread.&#x2019; &#x2018;Well, you will have to get used to it, because that is all there is. Tomorrow we will find something better.&#x2019; Mistrustfully the boy picks up a slice of bread and nibbles at it. His fingernails, he notices, are black with dirt. As the last daylight wanes, they settle down in their shelter, he on a bed of weeds, the boy in the crook of his arm. Soon the boy is asleep, his thumb in his mouth. In his own case sleep is slow in coming. He has no coat; in a while the cold begins to seep up into his body; he begins to shiver. It is not serious, it is only cold, it will not kill you, he says to himself. The night will pass, the sun will rise, the day will come. Only let there not be crawling insects. Crawling insects will be too much. He is asleep. In the early hours he wakes up, stiff, aching with cold. Anger wells up in him. Why this pointless misery? He crawls out of the shelter, gropes his way to the back door, and knocks, first discreetly, then more and more loudly. A window opens above; by moonlight he can faintly make out the girl&#x2019;s face. &#x2018;Yes?&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Is something wrong?&#x2019; &#x2018;Everything is wrong,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;It is cold out here. Will you please let us into the house.&#x2019; There is a long pause. Then: &#x2018;Wait,&#x2019; she says. He waits. Then: &#x2018;Here,&#x2019; says her voice. An object falls at his feet: a blanket, none too large, folded in four, made of some rough material, smelling of camphor. &#x2018;Why do you treat us like this?&#x2019; he calls out. &#x2018;Like dirt?&#x2019; The window thuds to. He crawls back into the shelter, wraps the blanket around himself and the sleeping child. He is woken by a clamour of birdsong. The boy, still sound asleep, lies turned away from him, his cap under his cheek. His own clothes are damp with dew. He dozes away again. When next he opens his eyes the girl is gazing down on him. &#x2018;Good morning,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;I have brought you some breakfast. I have to leave soon. When you are ready I will let you out.&#x2019; &#x2018;Let us out?&#x2019; &#x2018;Let you out through the house. Please be quick. Don&#x2019;t forget to bring the blanket and the towel.&#x2019; He wakes the child. &#x2018;Come,&#x2019; he says, &#x2018;time to get up. Time for breakfast.&#x2019; They pee side by side in a corner of the yard. Breakfast turns out to be more bread and water. The child disdains it; he himself is not hungry. He leaves the tray untouched on the step. &#x2018;We are ready to go,&#x2019; he calls out. The girl leads them through the house into the empty street. &#x2018;Goodbye,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;You can come back tonight if you need to.&#x2019; &#x2018;What about the room you promised at the Centre?&#x2019; &#x2018;If the key can&#x2019;t be found, or the room has been taken in the mean�time, you can sleep here again. Goodbye.&#x2019; &#x2018;Just a minute. Can you help us with some money?&#x2019; Thus far he has not had to beg, but he does not know where else to turn. &#x2018;I said I would help you, I didn&#x2019;t say I would provide you with money. For that you will have to go to the offices of the Asistencia Social. You can catch a bus in to the city. Be sure to take your pass�book along, and your proof of residence. Then you can draw your relocation allowance. Alternatively you can find a job and ask for an advance. I won&#x2019;t be at the Centre this morning, I have meetings, but if you go there and tell them you are looking for a job and want un vale, they will know what you mean. Un vale. Now I really must run.&#x2019; The track he and the boy follow across the empty parklands turns out to be the wrong one; by the time they reach the Centre the sun is already high in the sky. Behind the Trabajos counter is a woman of middle age, stern-faced, her hair drawn back over her ears and tied tightly behind. &#x2018;Good morning,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;We checked in yesterday. We are new arrivals, and I am looking for work. I understand you can give me un vale.&#x2019; &#x2018;Vale de trabajo,&#x2019; says the woman. &#x2018;Show me your passbook.&#x2019; He gives her his passbook. She inspects it, returns it. &#x2018;I will write you a vale, but as for the line of work you do, that is up to you to decide on.&#x2019; &#x2018;Have you any suggestions for where I should begin? This is foreign territory to me.&#x2019; &#x2018;Try the docks,&#x2019; says the woman. &#x2018;They are usually on the lookout for workers. Catch the Number 29 bus. It leaves from outside the main gate every half-hour.&#x2019; &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t have money for buses. I don&#x2019;t have money at all.&#x2019; &#x2018;The bus is free. All buses are free.&#x2019; &#x2018;And a place to stay? May I raise the question of a place to stay? The young lady who was on duty yesterday, Ana she is called, reserved a room for us, but we haven&#x2019;t been able to gain access.&#x2019; &#x2018;There are no rooms free.&#x2019; &#x2018;There was a room free yesterday, room C-55, but the key was mislaid. The key was in the care of se�ora Weiss.&#x2019; &#x2018;I know nothing about that. Come back this afternoon.&#x2019; &#x2018;Can&#x2019;t I speak to se�ora Weiss?&#x2019; &#x2018;There is a meeting of senior staff this morning. Se�ora Weiss is at the meeting. She will be back in the afternoon.&#x2019;</p><h2>If You&#39;re Missing Baby Jesus: A True Story that Embraces the Spirit of Christmas</h2><p>This is the heartwarming true story of a family that discovers in 1943 that the nativity set they&#39;ve purchased has come with two figurines of the baby Jesus. Fearing that someone was cheated out of the most important figurine in a nativity set, the mother cajoles the store owner into putting a sign on the shelf: &#34;If you&#39;re missing Baby Jesus, call 7162.&#34; On a frozen Christmas eve, someone calls-a single mother without food for her kids or heating oil for the furnace. Although she didn&#39;t buy a nativity set, she saw the sign and trusted that it was God&#39;s sign for her. Word spreads and neighbors hurry to her aid, even providing a tree and presents. The true meaning of Christmas is restored, not just for a woman and her children, but for an entire community. If You&#39;re Missing Baby Jesus: A True Story That Embraces the Spirit of Christmas is sure to become a holiday classic.</p><p>Jean Jeffrey Gietzen is a poet and essayist whose work has appeared in McCall&#39;s, Reader&#39;s Digest, Catholic Digest, A Second Chicken Soup for the Woman&#39;s Soul, and Multnomah&#39;s Stories for the Heart series. She is the author of A People Set Apart and Questions and Answers for Catechists. She is a mother of three and grandmother of four who lives in Tucson, Arizona.Grade 2-4-A moving story told in a simple and straightforward style from a child's point of view. During a bitterly cold winter in North Dakota in 1943, a young girl's mother buys a manger scene at the local five-and-dime and discovers that there are two identical Baby Jesus figures in the set. The woman puts up a notice at the store that reads: "If you're missing Baby Jesus, call 7162." On Christmas Eve, a woman living in an unheated house with her five children calls the number in desperation, hoping to find some good Christians, and the narrator's family gives her not only the extra Baby Jesus but also some much-needed help. The excitement of the season and the special joy of an adventure on Christmas Eve shine through and give this story its big-hearted appeal. The message that "Jesus saves" is emphasized but not in a heavy-handed manner. The accompanying woodcut illustrations lack grace but evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned, small-town Christmas.-E.M. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Astrological Gardening</h2><p>Demonstrates the use of the forces of nature as a guide for a successful garden, and covers a wide range of environmentally sound, organically grown fruits, vegetables, trees, herbs, and edible flowers.</p><p>The sun, the moon, the stars... and a flourishing garden<p> "It is not my intention to argue the merits of 'moon planting' or 'planting by the signs' but rather to set forth as clearly as I can the accumulated wisdom of the centuries regarding astrological gardening.

Yet at that time, in the most technologically advanced nation in the world, people buried meat in fresh earth to prevent mold forming and wrung sheets out in boiling water with their bare hands. Such household drudgery was routinely performed by the grandparents of people still living, but the knowledge of it has passed as if it had never been.<br><br> Judith Flanders's book is laid out like a Victorian house, taking you through the story of daily life from room to room. In each space she depicts the home's furnishings and decoration: from childbirth in the master bedroom, through the scullery and kitchen, the separate male and female domains of the drawing room and the parlor, and ending in the sickroom. A rich selection from diaries, letters, advice books, magazines, and paintings fills the rooms with the people and personalities of the age. 100 illustrations, 3 8-page color inserts. 100 illustrations, 3 8-page color inserts</p><p>Judith Flanders is the author of A Circle of Sisters, which was nominated for the Guardian First Book Award. She lives in London.<p> It is easy, and tempting, to take a romantic view of the Victorian Age, to wax sentimental about its high moral standards, its extraordinary literature, its great strides in industrial production and domestic conveniences and, of course, the good queen from whom it takes its name. Judith Flanders acknowledges as much at the end of her exhaustive study of domestic life in Victorian England. But in many respects the picture she draws -- and she draws it with obsessive attention to detail -- is a useful corrective to over-romanticizing. Her attention is focused on city life, London in particular; what she shows us is a world in which dirt, vermin and disease were nearly inescapable, and in which the labor of maintaining even the best-managed households was endless, exhausting and often dangerous.</p><p>The 19th century, as she says, "was the century of urbanization." Whereas in 1801 "only 20 percent of the population of Great Britain lived in cities," a century later "that figure had risen to nearly 80 percent." With a population of about a million in 1800, London was the largest city in the world, and at century's end that figure had multiplied five times. "To house the numbers of newly urbanized people was a challenge without precedent," Flanders writes. "One-third of the houses in Britain today were built before the First World War, and most of these are Victorian. In a period of less than seventy-five years, over six million houses were built, and the majority stand and function as homes still."</p><p>In London, as in New York and in certain sections of Washington, most of these houses are what the British call "terraced," which is approximately the same as what Americans call "row houses"; indeed Flanders betrays an ignorance of American society and history when she says that "unlike the American row house, the English terraced house is highly flexible socially and economically." Built in rows, sharing common walls, these houses solved the problem of urban living with impressive ingenuity, managing to combine economical use of urban space with the privacy that city dwellers longed for amid the growing depersonalization of society that was an inadvertent byproduct of the industrial age. Flanders writes:</p><p>"What the house contained, how it was laid out, what the occupations of its inhabitants were, what its housekeeper did all day: these were the details from which society built up its picture of the family and the home, and it is precisely these details that I am concerned with in this book. I have shaped the book not along a floor plan but along a life span. I begin in the bedroom, with childbirth, and move on to the nursery, and children's lives. Gradually I progress to the public rooms of the house and with these rooms the adult public world, marriage and social life, before moving on, via the sickroom, to illness and death. Thus a single house contains a multiplicity of lives." </p><p>As that suggests, there is much more to this book than architectural design, floor plans, household furniture and kitchenware. The chapter entitled "The Scullery" is only incidentally about the "dirty, and damp, and dark" place where scrubbing of tableware and cookware was done, where "all the jobs that could be passed over to the servants as soon as possible were performed"; it is really, as that suggests, about the lives and labors of servants, an immense class of more than a million people in mid-Victorian London. We see them now on "Upstairs, Downstairs" or in Merchant-Ivory films, and aren't given even a clue: "Most servants' work was backbreaking, and they were rarely healthy, suffering from long-term illnesses caused by poor nutrition, confined quarters, and lack of sun and fresh air." One of these, Hannah Cullwick, kept a diary. Here is her entry for July 16, 1860:</p><p>"Lighted the fire. Brush'd the grates. Clean'd the hall &amp; steps &amp; flags on my knees. Swept &amp; dusted the rooms. Got breakfast up. Made the beds &amp; emptied the slops. Clean'd &amp; wash'd up &amp; clean'd the [silver] plate. Clean'd the stairs &amp; the pantry on my knees. Clean'd the knives &amp; got dinner. Clean'd 3 pairs of boots. Clean'd away after dinner &amp; began the preserving about � past 3 &amp; kept on till 11, leaving off only to get the supper &amp; have my tea. Left the kitchen dirty &amp; went to bed very tired &amp; dirty." </p><p>That more than a million people daily performed such hard and demeaning labor is testimony to the central role of servants in polite Victorian society. The middle and upper-middle classes expanded dramatically as the fruits of industrialization and population growth spread far beyond the old nobility and gentility. The handsome houses in which they lived (in Victorian England people usually rented, rather than owned, their residences) were immensely labor-intensive, drawing housewives as well as servants into the work force: "The majority of women worked regularly and hard in their houses: they made the beds, cleaned the lamps, washed windows, skinned and prepared meat for cooking, and made preserves and wine, as well as cooking daily meals, dusting, sweeping, scrubbing, sewing and upholstering, doing the laundry, making curtains and clothes, and cutting and laying carpeting; many even repaired shoes and boots. All the things that it is now thought that 'genteel' women of the time did not do, they did." </p><p>Much of this labor was made necessary by the lack of anything approximating modern conveniences, even in the most privileged households, but much of it had to be done for the simple reason that London, like all cities of the age, was filthy. Dirt was everywhere: household dust, chimney soot and coal residue, night soil. Interior walls were covered with at least three coats of lead, and "some wallpapers had concentrations of [arsenic] that ran as high as 59 percent." Vermin were everywhere: "For us, mice and rats are the first thought at the word 'vermin'; for the Victorians it was bugs: blackbeetles, fleas, even crickets." If not fought incessantly, according to one contemporary account, they would "multiply till the kitchen floor at night palpitates with a living carpet, and in time the family cockroach will make raids on the upper rooms, . . . the beetles would collect in corners of the kitchen ceiling, and hanging to one another by their claws, would form huge bunches or swarms like bees towards evening and as night closed in, swarthy individuals would drop singly on to floor, or head, or food."</p><p> Yet somehow, though perched eternally at the edge of squalor, the Victorians managed to make decent lives for themselves, with comfortable parlors and dining rooms (the latter often served "as both a dining room and a family sitting room"), and drawing rooms for receiving and entertaining friends. That they did so was almost entirely due to women. The "hierarchy of authority was undisputed: God gave his authority to man, man ruled woman, and woman ruled her household -- both children and servants -- through the delegated authority she received from man." Women inhabited, as we can see from the vantage point of the 21st century, a "bizarre disjunction" in which they were both treasured and patronized: "As nurses, as mothers, as educators of future generations, women were able, capable, adept and proficient managers; as wives, as daughters, as sisters, women were unstable, fragile, uncertain creatures needing masculine guidance." </p><p>By the end of the 19th century that was beginning to change, albeit slowly and against masculine resistance, but it was daily reality for all except the most atypical Victorian women. To her credit Flanders does not bang the feminist drum -- simple statement of the facts is all that is required to underscore the self-evident points -- but it would be difficult indeed for any reader to come away from Inside the Victorian Home with anything except admiration for these doughty women and exasperation at the smug, self-righteous men who saw it as their God-given right to dominate and use them. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Barr demonstrates that what is really at war with religion is not science itself, but a philosophy called scientific materialism. <i>Modern Physics and Ancient Faith</i> argues that the great discoveries of modern physics are more compatible with the central teachings of Christianity and Judaism about God, the cosmos, and the human soul than with the atheistic viewpoint of scientific materialism.</p>Scientific materialism grew out of scientific discoveries made from the time of Copernicus up to the beginning of the twentieth century. These discoveries led many thoughtful people to the conclusion that the universe has no cause or purpose, that the human race is an accidental by-product of blind material forces, and that the ultimate reality is matter itself. Barr contends that the revolutionary discoveries of the twentieth century run counter to this line of thought. He uses five of these discoveries&#x2014;the Big Bang theory, unified field theories, anthropic coincidences, G�del&#x2019;s Theorem in mathematics, and quantum theory&#x2014;to cast serious doubt on the materialist&#x2019;s view of the world and to give greater credence to Judeo-Christian claims about God and the universe.&nbsp;Written in clear language, Barr&#x2019;s rigorous and fair text explains modern physics to general readers without oversimplification. Using the insights of modern physics, he reveals that modern scientific discoveries and religious faith are deeply consonant. Anyone with an interest in science and religion will find <i>Modern Physics and Ancient Faith</i> invaluable.&nbsp;&#x201c;A modern physicist who writes with extraordinary clarity and verve, and is familiar with the intellectual arguments long used by the ancient faiths, Stephen Barr gives a brilliant defense of the integrity of science in the teeth of its most powerful modern bias, by telling the exciting story of the rise, complacency, and fall of scientific materialism. As his story crackles along, and just at the point of reaching really difficult concepts, he has a knack for inventing illustrations that make one's inner light bulbs flash again and again.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Michael Novak, Winner of the 1994 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion</b>&nbsp;&#x201c;Barr has produced a brilliant and authoritative defense of Biblical faith in the light of contemporary science. He perceives a serious conflict, not between modern physics and ancient faith, but between religion and materialism.&nbsp;I know of no other book that makes the case against materialism so lucidly, honestly, and deftly.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Owen Gingerich, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</b>&nbsp;&#x201c;Written from the viewpoint of an accomplished physicist, this book is an invaluable contribution to the growing interest in the relationship between science and religion.

The book is well documented, and the exposition is masterful, making it a valuable asset for those theists wanting to learn more about the ways in which the sciences can contribute to the materialist-theist debate.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Journal of Religion</i></p><br><br><p>"Stephen Barr does heroic service with his book <i>Modern Physics and Ancient Faith</i> as a revolutionary insurgent within the intellectual hegemony of modern scientific materialism." &#x2014;<i>Crisis Magazine</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It is a happy day indeed when one finds a work by a scientist that is so clear, based upon serious reflection, and demonstrates a broad knowledge of philosophy and religion as well as science. <i>Modern Physics and Ancient Faith</i> is such a work.

Billions had died, billions more were doomed. Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random.

Deep within a fabled labyrinth on a barren world, a Planet of the Dead proscribed to mortals, lay a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans sought it. It was the fate of Horza, the Changer, and his motley crew of unpredictable mercenaries, human and machine, actually to find it, and with it their own destruction.</p><p>Iain Banks came to controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, <em>The Wasp Factory</em>, in 1984. <em>Consider Phlebas</em>, his first science fiction novel, was published under the name Iain M.

He is now widely acclaimed as one of the most powerful, innovative and exciting writers of his generation.In the midst of a war between two galactic empires, a shapechanging agent of the Iridans undertakes a clandestine mission to a forbidden planet in search of an intelligent, fugitive machine whose actions could alter the course of the conflict.

Gary Ezzo, a graduate of Talbot Seminary and School of Theology, teams up with pediatrician Dr. Robert Bucknam to explore the role of moral development in a child in this compact sequel to their controversial primer on newborn behavior, <i>On Becoming Baby Wise</i>. Four glowing, compelling commentaries highlight the very first pages of the book, which attempts to guide parents through a critical time in their child's growth and learning (ages 5 through 15 months). The authors make many rational arguments about a parent's duty to expect and encourage consistent, acceptable behaviors when the child is very young; over time, such training will lead to the development of moral concepts. While the outcome is desirable and the method--when used consistently--does work, this particular book lacks the many supportive examples and research references found in the first <i>Baby Wise</i>. The authors encourage readers to familiarize themselves with the original, and openly state that their methods are more effective for graduates of Baby Wise parenting--not demand-fed babies. So, this particular child-rearing book is not meant for all. Chapters feature topics including moral foundations, mealtime and wake-time activities, highchair manners, discipline, and teaching basic sign language. Most of the information is more philosophical than practical.

The greatest judge never to be appointed to the Supreme Court, Learned Hand is widely considered the peer of Justices Holmes, Brandeis, and Cardozo. In his more than fifty years on the bench, he left an unequaled legacy of lastingly influential writings. This distinctive biography goes well beyond Hand's official work, however, to depict both a complex human being and the times in which he lived. The first to draw on the enormous collection of the judge's private papers, the eminent constitutional scholar Gerald Gunther vividly portrays a public man consumed by private doubts. Gunther's lively account moves from Hand's childhood in a formidable (and anxiety-producing) family of lawyers to his years at Harvard as a studious outsider, his frustrating experience in private law practice, his felt inadequacies in marriage, and his work as a federal judge. Throughout his life, Hand believed himself unworthy of the accolades bestowed upon him; self-doubt permeated all aspects of his life.<br><br>Gunther subtly explores the ties between the modest, uncertain man -- a liberal skeptic who was never "too sure [he was] right" -- and his public record, and suggests that Hand's personal traits shaped his modest approach to judging: the questioning human being could not help acting that way as a judge. Hand's most enduring legacy is his advocacy of judicial restraint: repeatedly he sounded the dangers of excessive activism in unelected judges. Yet he mustered the courage to support such basic values as freedom of expression -- from his personally costly defense of dissenters amid the hysteria of World War I to his strong affirmation of free speech in his rulings on obscenity and his outspoken attacks on McCarthyism in the 1950s.<br><br>This biography also offers the perspective of one of this era's most sensitive public figures on the rich political and social history of the first six decades of the twentieth century. By examining Hand's voluminous correspondence with such acquaintances as Walter Lippmann, Felix Frankfurter, and Herbert Croly (with whom he was a founding contributor to The New Republic), Gunther illuminates Hand's intense involvement with the public issues of his times, such as his enthusiastic support of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive party. Gunther gives us a graphic portrait of a complex and uncommon man whose thoughts and words inspired generations of Americans and continue to do so today.</p><p>Gerald Gunther served as law clerk to Judge Learned Hand and later to Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s, and then entered private legal practice in New York. Since 1962 he has been Professor of Constitutional Law at Stanford University Law School, where he is also William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law.An exhaustive and affectionate, albeit admittedly biased, account of the life and legal work of one of the nation's greatest jurists. As Gunther correctly points out, although biographies of Supreme Court justices abound, very little attention is paid to the judges of the country's lower courts. Only a handful of these men and women become widely known or achieve lasting fame. An exception is Billings Learned Hand (1872-1961), arguably the greatest United States judge never to sit on the highest court. Yet he had, as a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (covering New York), a far greater impact upon the law than many who served on the more august body. Using, for the first time, the voluminous private papers of Hand (at the request of the judge's son-in-law), Gunther, a noted constitutional scholar at Stanford University, delves deeply into the life of this remarkable individual. Born in Albany to a family that could trace its roots to the Mayflower, Hand attended Harvard College, then ``drifted'' into Harvard Law School (he originally wanted to be a philosopher). After graduating he practiced law in his home town but eventually gravitated to Wall Street. Appointed to the federal bench in 1909 as a district court judge, Hand would decide one of the most influential free speech cases ever, the Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten decision of 1917, in which he protected dissident speech. He became an appellate judge in 1924 (eventually becoming chief judge) and quickly achieved prominence in American legal thought. He retired in 1951, after fighting against Cold War hysteria and McCarthyism from the bench. Former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell provides a foreword. An important work on an important figure, despite its reflection of the built-in prejudice of the biographer, who served as Hand's law clerk. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

England had been ravaged for decades by conspiracy, violence, murders, coups and countercoups. Through luck, guile and ruthlessness, Henry VII, the first of the Tudor kings, had clambered to the top of the heap&#x2014;a fugitive with a flimsy claim to England&#x2019;s throne. For many he remained a usurper, a false king. <br><br>But Henry had a crucial asset: his queen and their children, the living embodiment of his hoped-for dynasty. Queen Elizabeth was a member of the House of York. Henry himself was from the House of Lancaster, so between them they united the warring parties that had fought the bloody century-long Wars of the Roses. Now their older son, Arthur, was about to marry a Spanish princess. On a cold November day sixteen-year-old Catherine of Aragon arrived in London for a wedding that would mark a triumphal moment in Henry&#x2019;s reign. <br><br>In this remarkable book, Thomas Penn re-creates the story of the tragic, magnetic Henry VII&#x2014;a controlling, paranoid, avaricious monarch who was entering the most perilous years of his long reign. <br><br>Rich with drama and insight, <i>Winter King </i>is an astonishing story of pageantry, treachery, intrigue and incident&#x2014;and the fraught, dangerous birth of Tudor England.</p><p><b>Thomas Penn</b> is editorial director at Penguin Books UK. He holds a Ph.D. in medieval history from Clare College, Cambridge University, and writes for the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>, among other publications.&#x201c;I feel I&#x2019;ve been waiting to read this book a long time. It&#x2019;s a fluent and compelling account of the cost of founding the Tudor dynasty: of a clever, ruthless, enigmatic monarch, a refugee all his early life, king by right of conquest, prepared to harass and frighten his subjects into submission: a man content to be feared and not loved. The level of detail is fascinating and beautifully judged. The book shows what a mistake it is to regard these closing years of the reign simply as a curtain raiser for Henry VIII. I think that, for the first time, a writer has made me feel what contemporaries felt as Henry VII&#x2019;s reign drew to an end; the relief, the hope, the sudden buoyancy.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Hilary Mantel, Author of <i>Wolf Hall</i><br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful read, as rich in character and drama as <i>Wolf Hall</i>, only shorter and true.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;John Carey, author of <i>William</i> <i>Golding: The Man Who Wrote</i> Lord of the Flies<br><br>&#x201c;A definitive and accessible account of the reign of Henry VII that will alter our view not just of Henry, but of the country he dominated and corrupted, and of the dynasty he founded.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Philippa Gregory, <i>The Guardian</i> (UK)<br><br>"As Thomas Penn shows us so vividly in <i>Winter King</i>, the first Tudor monarch is as fascinating as his son and his life story nearly as full of drama and incident."<br> &#x2014;Martin Rubin, <i>The Wall Street Journal<br> </i><br><br>"Penn's book presents readers with the world of realpolitik as it was played out in the earliest years of the Tudor dynasty. . . .

A mysterious army known only as the Gardier has surrounded the country, attacking in ominous black airships. Hope is not lost though, for a magical sphere created by Ile-Rien&#39;s greatest sorcerer may hold the key to defeating the faceless enemy. But the sphere is unpredictable and has already claimed several lives. When a magical spell goes disastrously awry, young Tremaine Valiarde and a brave band are transported to another world. A world of rough magics, evil mages, honorable warriors -- and a secret Gardier base.</p><p>Martha Wells is the author of fourteen fantasy novels, including <i>The Wizard Hunters</i>, <i>The Ships of Air,</i> <i>The Gate of Gods</i>, <i>The Element of Fire</i>, and the Nebula-nominated <i>The Death of the Necromancer</i>. Her newest novel, <i>The Cloud Roads</i>, was published in March 2011 by Night Shade Books, and the sequel, <i>The Serpent Sea</i>, in January 2012. Her next fantasy novels will be <i>The Siren Depths</i>, to be published by Night Shade in December 2013, and <i>Emilie and the Hollow World</i>, to be published by Strange Chemistry Books in April 2013. She has had short stories in the magazines <i>Black Gate</i>, <i>Realms of Fantasy</i>, <i>Lone Star Stories</i>, and <i>Stargate Magazine</i>, and in the Tsunami Relief anthology <i>Elemental</i>. She has also written two media-tie-in novels, <i>Stargate Atlantis: Reliquary</i> and <i>Stargate Atlantis: Entanglement</i>."It was nine o'clock at night and Tremaine was trying to find a way to kill herself that would bring in a verdict of natural causes in court, when someone banged on the door." So begins Nebula-nominee Wells's entrancing return to the world of The Death of the Necromancer (1998), and if the rest of the book doesn't quite fulfill the promise of that first sentence, it comes very, very close. On Ile-Rien, a world besieged by the mysterious and well-nigh invulnerable Gardier, Tremaine is recruited to help devise a spell that can break through the Gardier airships' impregnable shields. Yet instead of creating a weapon, the spell transports Tremaine and a small band of cohorts to another world with a secret Gardier base, giving them a chance to spy on the enemy of which they know so little. Tremaine makes an engaging and resourceful heroine, if a reluctant one, while her well-drawn fellow adventurers add plenty of human interest. Where the book falters is in the repetitive action, as various characters fall into the hands of the Gardier, then escape, return to rescue comrades left behind or to attack, get recaptured and escape again and again. Wells's ability to keep the reader wondering what will happen next, however, more than compensates for this relatively minor flaw. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Finisher (Vega Jane, Book 1) (1)</h2><p>SHE WILL NOT BREAK<br>Vega Jane was always told no one could leave the town of Wormwood.

David and his family live in Virginia. <br><br>*Starred Review* What happens when an international best-selling crime novelist tries his hand at a youth fantasy? Well, in this case, success. Baldacci, best known for writing thrillers, also has a talent for creating magical worlds. At first glance, though, Wormwood seems mostly depressing. Like most other Wugs, 14-year-old Vega Jane is dirty, hungry, and deprived. The few things that keep her going are her friend Delph; her brother, John; and a tree where she goes to ponder. (Pondering is in short supply in Wormwood.) She also has her job at the Stacks, putting the finishing touches on pretty objects. But everything changes one morning when she spies her mentor, Quentin Herms, heading into the Quag, the terrifying forest that surrounds Wormwood. There are beasts inside the Quag, and supposedly nothing past it, so why would Herms run? The cryptic note he leaves behind raises more questions, and despite danger from many directions, Vega is a girl who wants answers. Baldacci gets several things just right. He offers readers a smart, tough heroine worth rooting for; provides enough hints of a mysterious backstory to keep them wondering; and builds each chapter to a cliff-hanger that pushes them to turn the page. There is also head-spinning action, which is sometimes a bit too repetitious. How often can Vega be chased by a monster and run faster than she has ever run in her life? The ending is predictable, but it leads seamlessly into the next book, where, perhaps, some of Vega&#x2019;s answers await.

But for now, he and his radio show must remain untraceable, because in addition to being a lifelong Vermonter and concerned citizen, Vern Barclay is also a fugitive from the law. <br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Radio Free Vermont</i>, Bill McKibben entertains and expands upon an idea that's become more popular than ever--seceding from the United States. Along with Vern and Perry, McKibben imagines an eccentric group of activists who carry out their own version of guerilla warfare, which includes dismissing local middle school children early in honor of 'Ethan Allen Day' and hijacking a Coors Light truck and replacing the stock with local brew. Witty, biting, and terrifyingly timely,<i> Radio Free Vermont</i> is Bill McKibben's fictional response to the burgeoning resistance movement.</p><p>Bill McKibben is an author and environmentalist.

S. Merwin has given us a shimmering new verse translation of the central section of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> -- the Purgatorio.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Led by Virgil, inspired by his love for Beatrice, Dante makes the arduous journey up the Mountain of Purgatory, where souls are cleansed to prepare them for the ultimate ascent to heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented with the original Italian text, and with Merwin's notes and commentary, this luminous new interpretation of Dante's great poem of sin, repentance, and salvation is a profoundly moving work of art and the definitive translation for our time.</p><p>In the foreword to his version of the <i>Purgatorio</i>, W.S. Merwin dwells on the quasi-insuperable hurdles that any translator of Dante must face. Choosing just a single line from the first canticle, he asks: "How could that, then, <i>really</i> be translated? It could not, of course." This makes Dante's masterpiece sound like the literary equivalent of <i>Mission: Impossible</i> ("Your mission, Mr. Merwin, should you choose to accept it...") Happily, however, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet decided to give it a try. He spent several years wrestling with Dante's inexhaustible tercets, and rather than applying himself to the fire-and-brimstone-scented thrills of the <i>Inferno</i>, Merwin turned to the middle and most humane portion of the entire work: <i>Purgatorio</i>. It's here, in a kind of spiritual halfway house between heaven and hell, that the poem reaches a peak of tenderness and regret--and rises quite literally from the dead.<p> Merwin's version must be measured against a good many predecessors, from John Ciardi's reader-friendly approach to Allen Mandelbaum's free-versifying to Charles Singleton's prosaic trot. How does this <i>Purgatorio</i> stack up? Very decently indeed. Merwin is something of a strict constructionist, who wants to hew as closely as possible to the syntax and sound of the original Italian. Yet he's no Nabokovian naysayer, slapping himself on the wrist every time he deviates from Dante's text, and he's wisely thrown the rhymes overboard. That leaves him with enough flexibility to echo some of the poem's loveliest effects: </p><blockquote> A sweet air that within itself was<br> unvarying struck me on the forehead,<br> a stroke no rougher than a gentle breeze,<br><p> at which the trembling branches all together<br> bent at once in that direction where<br> the holy mountain casts its first shadow,<br></p><p> without ever leaning over so far from<br> the upright as to make the small birds stop<br> the practice of their art in the treetops...<br> </p></blockquote> Merwin also does a good job capturing Dante's asperity, including his near-proverbial response to a rebuke from main squeeze Beatrice in Canto XXX: "As a mother may seem harsh to her child, / she seemed to me, because the flavor / of raw pity when tasted is bitter." There are moments, of course, when the translator's taste for literalism gets him in trouble. When, for example, Dante is surrounded by a crowd of souls in the second canto, who are astonished to see one of the living among them, he describes them as "<i>quasi obl�ando d'ire a farsi belle</i>." A difficult phrase to translate, yes, but Merwin's solution--"forgetting, it seemed, to go and see to their own beauty"--makes it sound as though they're late for an appointment at the hairdresser's. Still, these are minor flaws in a major and often marvelous piece of work. Can we look forward to a paradisiacal follow-up? <i>--James Marcus</i>"Forty years of producing highly reliable renderings of French and Spanish poetry and drama have culminated in what is bound to be hailed as Merwin's grandest translational accomplishment. Following on the heels of last year's <b>The River Sound</b> and the verse-novel <b>The Folding Cliffs</b> comes this deft and smooth interpretation of Dante. . . .This translation is something of a companion volume to Robert Pinsky's <b>Inferno</b> in the many ways it supercedes in elegance those of Singleton and Sinclair, which had been the last century's standards."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><p>"At last the <b>Purgatorio</b> can be read in English as a work of art. Art, including the art of poetry, is an important presence in this the central book of Dante's <b>Commedia</b>, and W.S. Merwin's gorgeous, accurate rendering is worthy of its great original."<br>-- Robert Pinsky, Poet Laureate of the United States<br></p><p>"It is only justice that Merwin should translate this cantica dedicated to 'natural' powers, the most human narrative of Dante's enterprise, 'remade in the way that trees are new, made new again when their leaves are new.' It is the absolute of transience both poets are caught up in, a mortal communication which has entangled Merwin in that certain twist of idiom we recognize as the style of solicitude: affectionate, absorbent, ardent. What better preparation for the absolute of Paradise than these mortal lights that must yield to eternal?"<br>-- Richard Howard<br></p><p>"W.S. Merwin's <b>Purgatorio</b> is a wise and eloquent version of what seems to many of us the most welcoming part of the <b>Commedia</b>. Once again Merwin demonstrates that he is a courteous and generous troubadour whose poetic gift is copious and heartening."<br>-- Harold Bloom</p></p><h2>The Lighthouse, No. 13 (Adam Dalgliesh mysteries)</h2><p>A subtle and powerful work of contemporary fiction.<br><br>Combe Island off the Cornish coast has a bloodstained history of piracy and cruelty but now, privately owned, it offers respite to over-stressed men and women in positions of high authority who require privacy and guaranteed security. But the peace of Combe is violated when one of the distinguished visitors is bizarrely murdered.<br><br>Commander Adam Dalgliesh is called in to solve the mystery quickly and discreetly, but at a difficult time for him and his depleted team. Dalgliesh is uncertain about his future with Emma Lavenham, the woman he loves; Detective Inspector Kate Miskin has her own emotional problems; and the ambitious Sergeant Francis Benton-Smith is worried about working under Kate. Hardly has the team begun to unravel the complicated motives of the suspects than there is a second brutal killing, and the whole investigation is jeopardized when Dalgliesh is faced with a danger more insidious and as potentially fatal as murder.<br><br>This eagerly awaited successor to the international bestseller <b>The Murder Room</b> displays all the qualities that lovers of P. D. James&#x2019;s novels the world over have come to expect: sensitive characterization, an exciting and superbly structured plot and vivid evocation of place.</p><p>P. D. James is the author of 18 books, most of which have been filmed for television. Before her retirement in 1979, she served in the forensics and criminal justice departments of Great Britain&#x2019;s Home Office, and she has been a magistrate and a governor of the BBC. The recipient of many prizes and honours, she was created Baroness James of Holland Park in 1991. In 2000 she celebrated her 80th birthday and published her autobiography, <b>Time to Be in Earnest</b>.Commander Adam Dalgliesh was not unused to being urgently summoned to non-scheduled meetings with unspecified people at inconvenient times, but usually with one purpose in common: he could be confident that somewhere there lay a dead body awaiting his attention. There were other urgent calls, other meetings, sometimes at the highest level. Dalgliesh, as a permanent ADC to the Commissioner, had a number of functions which, as they grew in number and importance, had become so ill-defined that most of his colleagues had given up trying to define them. But this meeting, called in Assistant Commissioner Harkness&#x2019;s office on the seventh floor of New Scotland Yard at ten-fifty-five on the morning of Saturday, 23 October, had, from his first entry into the room, the unmistakable presaging of murder. This had nothing to do with a certain serious tension on the faces turned towards him; a departmental debacle would have caused greater concern. It was rather that unnatural death always provoked a peculiar unease, an uncomfortable realisation that there were still some things that might not be susceptible to bureaucratic control.<br><br>There were only three men awaiting him and Dalgliesh was surprised to see Alexander Conistone of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He liked Conistone, who was one of the few eccentrics remaining in an increasingly conformist and politicised service. Conistone had acquired a reputation for crisis management. This was partly founded on his belief that there was no emergency that was not amenable to precedent or departmental regulations, but when these orthodoxies failed, he could reveal a dangerous capacity for imaginative initiatives which, by any bureaucratic logic, deserved to end in disaster but never did. Dalgliesh, for whom few of the labyrinths of Westminster bureaucracy were wholly unfamiliar, had earlier decided that this dichotomy of character was inherited. Generations of Conistones had been soldiers. The foreign fields of Britain&#x2019;s imperialistic past were enriched by the bodies of unmemorialised victims of previous Conistones&#x2019; crises management. Even Conistone&#x2019;s eccentric appearance reflected a personal ambiguity. Alone among his colleagues, he dressed with the careful pinstriped conformity of a civil servant of the Thirties while, with his strong bony face, mottled cheeks and hair with the resilient waywardness of straw, he looked like a farmer.<br><br>He was seated next to Dalgliesh opposite one of the wide windows. Having sat through the first ten minutes of the present meeting with an unusual economy of words, he sat, his chair a little tilted, complacently surveying the panorama of towers and spires, lit by a transitory unseasonable morning sun. Of the four men in the room&#x2014;Conistone, Adam Dalgliesh, Assistant Commissioner Harkness and a fresh-faced boy from MI5 who had been introduced as Colin Reeves&#x2014;Conistone, the one most concerned with the matter in hand, had so far said the least while Reeves, preoccupied with the effort of remembering what was being said without the humiliating expedient of being seen to take notes, hadn&#x2019;t yet spoken. Now Conistone stirred himself for a summing up.<br><br>&#x201c;Murder would be the most embarrassing for us, suicide hardly less so in the circumstances. Accidental death we could probably live with. Given the victim, there&#x2019;s bound to be publicity whichever it is, but it should be manageable unless this is murder. The problem is that we haven&#x2019;t much time. No date has been fixed yet, but the PM would like to arrange this top-secret international get-together in early January. A good time. Parliament not sitting, nothing much happens just after Christmas, nothing is expected to happen. The PM seems to have set his mind on Combe. So you&#x2019;ll take on the case, Adam? Good.&#x201d;<br><br>Before Dalgliesh could reply, Harkness broke in, &#x201c;The security rating, if it comes off, couldn&#x2019;t be higher.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh thought, <i>And even if you&#x2019;re in the know, which I doubt, you have no intention of telling me who will be meeting at this top-secret conference, or why.</i> Security was always on a need-to-know basis. He could make his guesses, but had no particular curiosity. On the other hand, he was being asked to investigate a violent death and there were things he needed to be told.<br><br>Before Colin Reeves had time to realise that this was his cue to intervene, Conistone said, &#x201c;All that will be taken care of, of course. We&#x2019;re not expecting problems. There was a similar situation some years ago&#x2014;before your time, Harkness&#x2014;when a VIP politician thought he&#x2019;d like a respite from his protection officer and booked two weeks on Combe. The visitor stood the silence and solitude for two days before realising that his life was meaningless without his red boxes. I should have thought that that was the message Combe was established to convey, but he didn&#x2019;t get it. No, I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll be worrying our friends south of the Thames.&#x201d;<br><br>Well, that, at least, was a relief. To have the security services involved was always a complication. Dalgliesh reflected that the secret service, like the monarchy, in yielding up its mystique in response to public enthusiasm for greater openness, seemed to have lost some of that half-ecclesiastical patina of authority bestowed on those who dealt in esoteric mysteries. Today its head was known by name and pictured in the press, the previous head had actually written her autobiography, and its headquarters, an eccentric oriental-looking monument to modernity which dominated its stretch of the south bank of the Thames, seemed designed to attract rather than repel curiosity. To surrender mystique had its disadvantages; an organisation came to be regarded like any other bureaucracy, staffed by the same fallible human beings and liable to the same cock-ups. But he expected no problems with the secret service. The fact that MI5 was represented at middle-grade level suggested that this single death on an offshore island was among the least of their present concerns.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go inadequately briefed. You&#x2019;ve given me nothing except who&#x2019;s dead, where he died and apparently how. Tell me about the island. Where exactly is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness was in one of his more difficult moods, his ill humour imperfectly concealed by self-importance and a tendency to verbosity. The large map on the table was a little crooked. Frowning, he aligned it more accurately with the edge of the table, pushed it towards Dalgliesh and stabbed it with his forefinger.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s here. Combe Island. Off the coast of Cornwall, about twenty miles south-west of Lundy Island and roughly twelve miles from the mainland, Pentworthy in this case. Newquay is the nearest large town.&#x201d; He looked over at Conistone. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better carry on. It&#x2019;s more your baby than ours.&#x201d;<br><br>Conistone spoke directly to Dalgliesh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll waste a little time on the history. It explains Combe and if you don&#x2019;t know it you may start under a disadvantage. The island was owned for over four hundred years by the Holcombe family, who acquired it in the sixteenth century, although no one seems clear exactly how. Probably a Holcombe rowed out with a few armed retainers, hoisted his personal standard and took it over. There can&#x2019;t have been much competition. The title was later ratified by Henry the Eighth once he&#x2019;d got rid of the Mediterranean pirates who&#x2019;d established it as a base for their slave-trading raids along the Devon and Cornish coasts. After that Combe lay more or less neglected until the eighteenth century, when the family began to take an interest in it, and visited occasionally to look at the bird-life or spend the day picnicking. Then a Gerald Holcombe, born in the late eighteen hundreds, decided to use the island for family holidays. He restored the cottages and, in 1912, built a house and additional accommodation for the staff. The family went there every summer in those heady days before the First World War. The war changed everything. The two elder sons were killed, one in France, the other at Gallipoli. The Holcombes are the kind of family who die in wars, not make money from them. That left only the youngest, Henry, who was consumptive and unfit for military service. Apparently, after the death of his brothers he was oppressed by a sense of general unworthiness and had no particular wish to inherit. The money hadn&#x2019;t come from land but from fortunate investments, and by the late Twenties they had more or less dried up. So in 1930 he set up a charitable trust with what was left, found some wealthy supporters and handed over the island and the property. His idea was that it should be used as a place of rest and seclusion for men in positions of responsibility who needed to get away from the rigours of their professional lives.&#x201d;<br><br>Now, for the first time, he bent down to open his briefcase and took out a file with a security marking. Rummaging among the documents, he brought out a single sheet of paper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the exact wording here. It makes Henry Holcombe&#x2019;s intentions clear. <i>For men who undertake the dangerous and arduous business of exercising high responsibility in the service of the Crown and of their country, whether in the armed forces, politics, science, industry or the arts, and who require a restorative period of solitude, silence and peace</i>. Engagingly typical of its age, isn&#x2019;t it? No mention of women, of course. This was 1930, remember. However, the accepted convention is held to apply, that the word &#x2018;men&#x2019; embraces women. They take a maximum of five visitors, whom they accommodate at their choice either in the main house or in one of the stone cottages. Basically what Combe Island offers is peace and security. In the last few decades the latter has bec...</p><h2>All Things Wise and Wonderful/the Lord God Made Them All</h2><p>Book by Herriot, James</p><p></p><h2>Practical Programming for Strength Training</h2><p>Practical Programming offers a different approach to exercise programming than that typically found in other exercise texts. Based on a combined 60+ years of academic expertise, elite-level coaching experience, and the observation of thousands of novice trainees, the authors present a chronological analysis of the response to exercise as it varies through the training history of the athlete, one that reflects the realities of human physiology, sports psychology, and common sense. Contrary to the one-size-fits-all models of periodization offered elsewhere, Practical Programming explains the differences in response to exercise commonly observed between athletes at the novice, intermediate, and advanced levels, explains these differences in the context of the relevant exercise science, and presents new training models that actually work for athletes at all levels of experience. Complete with new, innovative graphical representations of cutting-edge concepts in exercise programming, Practical Programming is sure to become a standard reference in the field of exercise and human performance.

The long drives to V�xj� and the irregular hours proved difficult to manage with Petra&#x2019;s job in the Parks Department and Agnes&#x2019;s autism. </p><p>Only two weeks ago, Anders and Petra had been sitting at the kitchen table trying to work out what on earth they were going to do. </p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t go on like this,&#x201d; Anders had said. </p><p>&#x201c;But what alternative do we have?&#x201d; she whispered. </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Anders replied, wiping the tears from her cheeks.</p><p>Agnes&#x2019;s teaching assistant at her preschool had told them that Agnes had had a difficult day. She had refused to let go of her milk glass, and the other children had laughed. She hadn&#x2019;t been able to accept that break time was over, because Anders hadn&#x2019;t come to pick her up as he usually did. He had driven straight back from V�xj� but hadn&#x2019;t reached the preschool until six o&#x2019;clock. Agnes was still sitting in the dining room with her hands around the glass when he arrived. </p><p>When they got home, Agnes had stood in her room, staring at the wall beside the dollhouse, clapping her hands in that introverted way she had. They don&#x2019;t know what she can see there, but she says that gray sticks keep appearing, and she has to count them, and stop them. She does that when she&#x2019;s feeling particularly anxious. Sometimes ten minutes is enough, but that evening she stood there for more than four hours before they could get her into bed. </p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 </p><p>The last security door closes, and they head down the corridor to the isolation cells. The fluorescent light in the ceiling reflects off the linoleum floor. The textured wallpaper has a groove worn into it from the rail on the food cart. </p><p>Roland puts his pass card away and lets Anders walk ahead of him toward the heavy metal door. </p><p>Through the reinforced glass, Anders can see a thin man sitting on a plastic chair. He is dressed in blue jeans and a denim shirt. The man is clean-shaven, and his eyes seem remarkably calm. The many wrinkles covering his pale face look like the cracked clay at the bottom of a dried-up riverbed. </p><p>Jurek Walter was found guilty of only two murders and one attempted murder, but there&#x2019;s compelling evidence linking him to nineteen others. </p><p>Thirteen years ago, he was caught red-handed in Lill-Jan&#x2019;s Forest, on Djurg�rden, in Stockholm, forcing a fifty-year-old woman back into a coffin in the ground. She had been kept in the coffin for almost two years, but was still alive. The woman had sustained terrible injuries, she was malnourished, her muscles had withered away, she had appalling pressure sores and frostbite, and she had suffered severe brain damage. If the police hadn&#x2019;t followed and arrested Jurek Walter beside the coffin, he might never have been stopped. </p><p>Now Roland takes out three small glass bottles containing yellow powder, puts some saline into each of the bottles, shakes them carefully, then draws the contents into a syringe. </p><p>He puts his earplugs in and opens the small hatch in the door. There&#x2019;s a clatter of metal, and a heavy smell of concrete and dust hits them. </p><p>In a dispassionate voice, Roland tells Jurek that it&#x2019;s time for his injection. </p><p>The man lifts his chin and gets up softly from the chair, turns to look at the hatch in the door, and unbuttons his shirt as he approaches. </p><p>&#x201c;Stop and take your shirt off,&#x201d; Roland says. </p><p>Jurek steps slowly forward and Roland quickly closes the hatch. Jurek stops, undoes the last buttons, and lets his shirt fall to the floor. </p><p>His body looks as if it had once been in good shape, but now his muscles are loose and his wrinkled skin is sagging. </p><p>Roland opens the hatch again. Jurek approaches and holds out his sinewy arm. </p><p>Anders washes his upper arm with rubbing alcohol. Roland pushes the syringe into the soft muscle and injects the liquid too quickly. Jurek&#x2019;s hand jerks in surprise, but he doesn&#x2019;t pull his arm back until he&#x2019;s been given permission. Roland hurriedly bolts the hatch, removes his earplugs, smiles nervously to himself, and then looks inside. </p><p>Jurek is stumbling toward the bed, where he stops and sits down.</p><p>Suddenly he twists to look at the door, and Roland drops the syringe. </p><p>He tries to catch it, but it rolls away across the floor.</p><p>Anders steps forward and picks up the syringe, and when they both stand and turn back toward the cell, they see that the inside of the reinforced glass is misted. Jurek Walter has breathed on the glass and written &#x201c;Joona&#x201d; with his finger. </p><p>&#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d; Anders asks weakly. </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s written &#x2018;Joona.&#x2019;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What the hell does that mean?&#x201d; </p><p>When the condensation clears, they see that Jurek Walter is sitting as if he hasn&#x2019;t moved. He looks at the arm where he got the injection, massages the muscle, then looks at them through the glass.</p><p>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t say anything else?&#x201d; Anders asks. </p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; </p><p>There&#x2019;s a bestial roar from the other side of the heavy door. Jurek has slid off the bed and is on his knees, screaming. The sinews in his neck are taut, his veins swollen.</p><p>&#x201c;How much did you actually give him?&#x201d; Anders asks. </p><p>Jurek&#x2019;s eyes roll back and turn white. He reaches out a hand to support himself and stretches one leg but topples over backward. He hits his head on the bedside table. Then he screams, and his body jerks spasmodically. </p><p>&#x201c;Jesus Christ,&#x201d; Anders whispers. </p><p>Jurek slips onto the floor, his legs kicking uncontrollably. He bites his tongue, and blood sprays out over his chest. He lies there on his back, gasping. </p><p>&#x201c;What do we do if he dies?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Cremate him,&#x201d; Roland says. </p><p>Jurek is cramping again, his whole body shaking, and his hands flail in every direction, until they suddenly stop. </p><p>Roland looks at his watch. Sweat is running down his cheeks. </p><p>Jurek Walter whimpers, rolls onto his side and tries to get up, but fails. </p><p>&#x201c;You can go inside in a couple of minutes,&#x201d; Roland says. </p><p>&#x201c;Am I really going in there?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll soon be completely harmless.&#x201d; </p><p>Jurek is crawling on all fours, bloody slime drooling from his mouth. He sways and slows down until he finally slumps to the floor and lies still. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></i></p><h2>Unnatural Causes (Adam Dagliesh Mystery Series #3)</h2><p>Hoping for a peaceful vacation in Suffolk, Adam Dalgliesh encounters instead the mystery of a famous crime writer&#39;s body found handless and floating in a local vicar&#39;s boat</p><p>Maurice Seton was a famous mystery writer -- but no murder from his imagination could equal the ghastliness of his own death.

J.A.H. 2003 Audie Award Finalist � AudioFile 2003, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>My Own Two Feet</h2><p><p><em>The New Yorker</em> said of the first volume of Beverly Cleary's memoirs, "It is a warm, honest book, as interesting as any novel, and describes the growing-up process with remarkable clarity and candor." Now the creator of Ramona Quimby and Henry Huggins writes of her early adulthood with humor and insight, making Beverly Cleary's own story as lively and irresistible as any of her novels.</p><p>In 1934, Beverly Bunn left home to attend college in California, which she imagined as the land of orange groves and movie stars, far removed from the hardships of the Depression. As a young woman who 11 was sure where she wanted to go but did not know if she could find the money to get there," she juggled studies of Chaucer and French grammar with the many chores that came with life in a student cooperative house. She also found time to eat a bacon and tomato sandwich with a quiet young man named Clarence Cleary.</p><p>Work as a librarian brought her into contact with all sorts of youngsters, from the children of the unemployed to the offspring of doctors and lawyers. But it was the children who built scooters out of apple boxes and roller skates who truly inspired her. They asked, "Where are the books about kids like us?" and the young librarian responded with her first book, about a boy named Henry who had a dog named Spareribs-later changed to Ribsy.</p><p>Told with the deep understanding of human nature that has made her books beloved by three generations of readers, <em>My Own Two Feet</em> is a lively, unforgettable look at the early years of a woman whose books speak directly to the hearts and imaginations of children everywhere.</p></p><p><p>Beverly Cleary is one of America's most beloved authors. As a child, she struggled with reading and writing. But by third grade, after spending much time in her public library in Portland, Oregon, she found her skills had greatly improved. Before long, her school librarian was saying that she should write children's books when she grew up.</p><p>Instead she became a librarian. When a young boy asked her, "Where are the books about kids like us?" she remembered her teacher's encouragement and was inspired to write the books she'd longed to read but couldn't find when she was younger. She based her funny stories on her own neighborhood experiences and the sort of children she knew. And so, the Klickitat Street gang was born!</p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, presented to her in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. <em>Dear Mr. Henshaw</em> won the Newbery Medal, and <em>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</em> and <em>Ramona and Her Father</em> have been named Newbery Honor Books. Her characters, including Beezus and Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ralph, the motorcycle-riding mouse, have delighted children for generations.</p>Gr. 7 and up. Cleary begins the second part of her autobiography where <i>A Girl from Yamhill</i> (1988) ends, as she is about to depart for college. Much of Cleary's success as a writer comes from her ability to write so honestly. She almost never makes a misstep, and that's as true here as it is in her fiction. The language is plain, but the images evoked are vivid, and Cleary ably creates a portrait of an era as well as of herself. As she did in the previous volume, she writes quite candidly of her relationships. She does not sugarcoat her relationship with her mother, and the keen eye for human nature that has served her so well over the years is put to good use here as she describes family members, co-workers, and cohorts. Of course, there is a question of audience. In addition to Cleary's college years, this memoir covers the courting and wedding of Beverly and Clarence Cleary and her work as a librarian during World War II. The book's most appreciative audience will be several generations of adults who have grown up with Cleary's books, but there's certainly a place for this on youth shelves as well. Older kids will find it a welcome change in the biography section. For one thing, it's so much better written than many titles found there; for another, the subject is much better loved. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Cruisin&#39; Through Life at 35 MPH: Six Strategies to Keep your Internal Engine Running Smoothly</h2><p>This book puts the reader into the driver&#39;s seat of life.

Long awaited, Parable of the Talents is the continuation of the travails of Lauren Olamina, the heroine of 1994's Nebula-Prize finalist, bestselling Parable of the Sower. Parable of the Talents is told in the voice of Lauren Olamina's daughter&#x2014;from whom she has been separated for most of the girl's life&#x2014;with sections in the form of Lauren's journal. Against a background of a war-torn continent, and with a far-right religious crusader in the office of the U.S. presidency, this is a book about a society whose very fabric has been torn asunder, and where the basic physical and emotional needs of people seem almost impossible to meet.</p><p>Octavia Butler tackles the creation of a new religion, the making of a god, and the ultimate fate of humanity in her Earthseed series, which began with <i>Parable of the Sower</i>, and now continues with <i>Parable of the Talents</i>. The saga began with the near-future dystopian tale of <i>Sower</i>, in which young Lauren Olamina began to realize her destiny as a leader of people dispossessed and destroyed by the crumbling of society. The basic principles of Lauren's faith, Earthseed, were contained in a collection of deceptively simple proverbs that Lauren used to recruit followers. She teaches that "God is change" and that humanity's ultimate destiny is among the stars.<p> In <i>Parable of the Talents</i>, the seeds of change that Lauren planted begin to bear fruit, but in unpredictable and brutal ways. Her small community is destroyed, her child is kidnapped, and she is imprisoned by sadistic zealots. She must find a way to escape and begin again, without family or friends. Her single-mindedness in teaching Earthseed may be her only chance to survive, but paradoxically, may cause the ultimate estrangement of her beloved daughter. <i>Parable of the Talents</i> is told from both mother's and daughter's perspectives, but it is the narrative of Lauren's grown daughter, who has seen her mother made into a deity of sorts, that is the most compelling. Butler's writing is simple and elegant, and her storytelling skills are superb, as usual. Fans will be eagerly awaiting the next installment in what promises to be a moving and adventurous saga. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Lauren Olamina&#39;s love is divided among her young daughter, her community, and the revelation that led Lauren to found a new faith that teaches &#34;God Is Change&#34;. But in the wake of environmental and economic chaos, the U.S. government turns a blind eye to violent bigots who consider the mere existence of a black female leader a threat. And soon Lauren must either sacrifice her child and her followers -- or forsake the religion that can transform human destiny.</p><h2>The Death of Virgil</h2><p>During the last eighteen hours of his life, the Roman poet, Virgil, debates destroying the manuscript of his poem, the Aeneid</p><p>It is the reign of the Emperor Augustus, and Publius Vergilius Maro, the poet of the Aeneid and Caesar&#39;s enchanter, has been summoned to the palace, where he will shortly die. Out of the last hours of Virgil&#39;s life and the final stirrings of his consciousness, the Austrian writer Hermann Broch fashioned one of the great works of twentieth-century modernism, a book that embraces an entire world and renders it with an immediacy that is at once sensual and profound. Begun while Broch was imprisoned in a German concentration camp, The Death of Virgil is part historical novel and part prose poem -- and always an intensely musical and immensely evocative meditation on the relation between life and death, the ancient and the modern."Broch is the greatest novelist European literature has produced since Joyce, and...The Death of Virgil represents the only genuine technical advance that fiction has made since Ulysses." -- George Steiner<p>"Hermann Broch belongs in that tradition of great twentieth-century novelists who have transformed, almost beyond recognition, one of the classic art forms of the nineteenth century."</p><p>-- Hannah Arendt</p></p><h2>A Breach of Promise (William Monk Novels)</h2><p>When Anne Perry sets her magic pen to paper, Victorian England awakens from her long sleep to vibrant, teeming life. Firelight flickers in luxurious withdrawing rooms. Ambitious ladies gossip and scheme. Horse-drawn carriages clatter over cobblestones while cries of flower sellers and newsboys ring out in crowded streets. In this magnificent new novel featuring investigator William Monk, however, it is the breathless hush of a London courtroom that first holds readers enthralled.<br><br>The plaintiffs in a sensational breach of promise suit are wealthy social climbers Barton and Delphine Lambert, suing on behalf of their beautiful daughter, Zillah. The defendant is Zillah's alleged fianc�, brilliant young architect Killian Melville, who adamantly declares that he will not, cannot, marry her. Not even to his baffled counsel, distinguished barrister Sir Oliver Rathbone, will Killian explain his rejection of rich and charming Zillah.<br><br>Utterly baffled, Rathbone turns for help to his old comrades in crime--Monk, the private investigator who knows his city like the back of his hand, and fearless nurse Hester Latterly. But even as they scout London for clues, from Mayfair to sordid Devil's Acre, the case suddenly and tragically ends. An outcome that no one--except a ruthless murderer--could have foreseen.<br><br>Stripping away the pretty masks that conceal society's darkest transgressions, Anne Perry unflinchingly exposes the human heart's deepest hiding places--and creates the most mesmerizing courtroom drama of her distinguished career.</p><p>The promises that are breached, broken, and never born in Anne Perry's rich and resonant new William Monk mystery all have to do with the roles and positions of women in Victorian society. At the center of the book is a rousing courtroom drama, as young Zillah Lambert--daughter of a wealthy, well-meaning northern businessman and his socially ambitious wife--sues an immensely gifted architect, Killian Melville. Melville, Zillah argues, failed to live up to his promise of marriage and thereby ruined her chances of making any sort of acceptable match. Private detective Monk is brought into the case by lawyer Oliver Rathbone when his client (Melville), facing financial and social ruin, still refuses to offer any reason for his dastardly conduct.<p> Monk's attentions are occupied elsewhere, too. Hester Latterly, the courageous nurse who worked with Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War, and whose favors Monk and Rathbone both desire, is looking after a British officer, Gabriel Sheldon, who was badly wounded and disfigured in India. Gabriel's wife, Perdita, is having trouble adjusting to her husband's broken body and spirit. "It was not Perdita's fault that she was confused and frightened," Monk muses. "She had been protected all her short life. She had not chosen to be, it was her assigned role." Monk has also promised a housemaid in the Sheldons' service that he will look for her two little nieces--deaf and deformed from birth--who were abandoned by their mother almost 20 years before. As the cases tangle and combine (perhaps a tad too coincidentally for some tastes, but, then again, real life is full of coincidences), Perry manages to show us the many ways in which women were made to pay for their place in a male-dominated society. She also delivers a touching and surprisingly suspenseful story.

One of the best perks of my job is getting sneak previews of upcoming books, and I take full advantage of that perk with Anne Perry's novels. As any follower of the William Monk series knows, the somewhat triangular relationship shared by Monk, nurse Hester Latterly, and barrister Oliver Rathbone is one of the enduring themes of the series. Although I read the William Monk novels for the edge-of-your-seat suspense and fascinating historical detail that Anne Perry is known for, I also read the series to find out the answer to the burning question: what will happen to them next? Well, when the bound galleys for A BREACH OF PROMISE came out, I immediately took one home with me for the weekend and read, spellbound, for two days. Let me tell you: this one has a kicker of an ending.

With its themes of love transformed and questing heroine, the story has much in common with "Beauty and the Beast" and "East of the Sun, West of the Moon" (which Long and Ogburn note in a foreword). The tale begins when a father promises a lark to his youngest daughter and then must make a hard bargain with its owner, a lion. To fulfill that agreement, the young woman returns to the lion's enchanted castle. She discovers that he is a lion by day and a handsome prince by night. The two fall in love, marry, and live happily until the lady desires to return home for a visit. Long's oil paintings on watercolor paper are appropriately lavish and romantic, rich with color and detail. The endpapers are covered with elaborate line drawings of vines and animals, and ornate, stylized borders frame each page. Long and Ogburn emphasize the heroine's strength of character: she honorably carries out her father's promise and greets the lion, noting: "A lion that loves birds will do no harm." The beast is ultimately transformed through the magic of human love, along with the heroine's perseverance.--Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.K-Gr. 3. As they explain in a note, Long and Ogburn have adapted and condensed one of the Grimms' fairy tales, "The Singing, Springing Lark," into a story that also has elements of "Beauty and the Beast" and "East of the Sun, West of the Moon." A merchant's daughter finds her true love, who lives under an enchantment that gives him the form of a lion by day and a prince by night. After she loses him through a foolish mistake, she searches the world to find him and win his freedom from the wicked enchantress. The dramatic tale is smoothly told, but the illustrations, with even more drama and lush with romance, take center stage here. The oil paintings use flowing compositions, swirling lines, rich colors, and a profusion of subtle patterns to create a series of detailed scenes combining European and Middle Eastern elements. A beautiful picture book for the fairy-tale set. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His work was farming, his study and passion were farming, his pleasures and his social life occurred in the intervals between farm jobs and in the jobs themselves. He was not an ambitious farmer&#x2015;he did not propose to own a large acreage or to become rich&#x2015;but merely a good and a gifted one. By the time he was twenty-five, he had managed, in spite of the hard times of the 189os, to make a down payment on the little farm that he husbanded and improved all his life. It was a farm of ninety-eight acres, and Tol never longed even for the two more that would have made it a hundred.</p> <p>Of pleasures and social life, he had a plenty. The Proudfoots were a large, exuberant clan of large people, though by my time Tol was the last one of them in the Port William neighborhood, and Tol was childless. The Proudfoots were not, if they could help it, solitary workers. They swapped work among themselves and with their neighbors, and their workdays involved a mighty dinner at noontime, much talk and laughter, and much incidental sport.</p> <p>As an after-dinner amusement and aid to digestion, the Proudfoot big boys and young men would often out-line a square or a circle on the ground, and get into it and wrestle. Everybody wrestled with everybody, for the object was to see who would be the last one in the ring. The manpower involved might better have been rated as horsepower, and great feats of strength were accomplished. Now and again great physical damage was accomplished, as when, for example, one Proudfoot would endeavor to throw another Proudfoot out of the ring through the trunk of a large tree. Sometimes, after failing to make headway through a tree trunk or barn door, a Proudfoot would lie very still on the ground for several minutes before he could get up. Sometimes, one Proud-foot or another would be unable to go back to work in the afternoon. These contests would be accompanied by much grunting, and by more laughter, as the Proudfoots were hard to anger. For a Proudfoot boy to become big enough and brave enough finally to set foot in that ring was a rite of passage. For a Proudfoot to stand alone in that ring&#x2015;as Tol did finally, and then often did&#x2015;was to know a kind of triumph and a kind of glory. Tol was big even for a Proudfoot, and the others could seldom take him off his feet. He tumbled them out, ass over elbows, one by one, in a manner more workmanly than violent, laughing all the time.</p> <p>Tol was overabundant in both size and strength. And perhaps because animate creatures tended to get out of his way, he paid not much attention to himself. He damaged his clothes just by being in them, as though surprising them by an assortment of stresses and strains for which they had not been adequately prepared. The people around Port William respected Tol as a farmer; they loved to tell and retell and hear and hear again the tales of his great strength; they were amused by the looks of him, by his good humor, and by his outsized fumblings and foibles. But never, for a long time, would any of them have suspected that his great bulk might embody tender feelings.</p> <p>But Tol did embody tender feelings, and very powerful tender feelings they were. For Tol, through many years, had maintained somewhere about the center of himself a most noble and humble and never-mentioned admiration for Miss Minnie Quinch. Miss Minnie was as small and quick as Tol was big and lumbering. Like him, she was a Port Williamite. She had taught for many years at Goforth School, grades one through eight, which served the neighborhood of Katy's Branch and Cotman Ridge in which Tors farm lay. When she was hardly more than a girl, Miss Minnie had gone away to a teacher's college and prepared herself to teach by learning many cunning methods that she never afterward used. For Miss Minnie loved children and she loved books, and she taught merely by introducing the one to the other. When she had trouble with one of the rougher big boys, she went straight to that boy's father and required that measures be taken. And measures usually were taken, so surprisingly direct and demanding was that lady's gaze.</p> <p>For as many years as Miss Minnie had taught at Goforth School, Tol had admired her from a distance, and without ever looking directly at her when she might have been about to look directly at him. He thought she was the finest, prettiest, nicest little woman he had ever seen. He praised her to himself by saying, "She's just a pocket-size pretty little thing." But he was sure that she would never want to be around a big, rough, unschooled fellow like himself.</p> <p>Miss Minnie did, from time to time, look directly at Tol, but not ever when he might have been about to look directly at her. More than once she thought rather wistfully that so large and strong a man as Tol ought to be some woman's knight and protector. She was, in fact, somewhat concerned about him, for he was thirty-six, well past the age when men usually got married. That she herself was thirty-four and unmarried was something she also thought from time to time, but always in a different thought. She kept her concern about Tol limited very strictly to concern, for she was conscious of being a small person unable even to hope to arrest the gaze of so splendid a man.</p> <p>For years, because of mutual avoidance of each other's direct gaze, their paths did not cross. Although they met and passed, they did not do so in a way that required more than a polite nod, which they both accomplished with a seriousness amounting almost to solemnity. And then one morning in Port William, Tol came out of Beater Chatham's store directly face-to-face with Miss Minnie who was coming in, and who smiled at him before she could think and said, "Well, good morning, Mr. Proudfoot!"</p> <p>Tol's mouth opened, but nothing came out of it. Nothing at all. This was unusual, for Tol, when he felt like it, was a talkative man. He kept walking because he was already walking, but for several yards he got along without any assistance from his faculties. Sight and sense did not return to him until he had walked with some force into the tailgate of his wagon.</p> <p>All the rest of that day he went about his work in a somewhat visionary state, saying to himself, and to the surprise of his horses and his dog, "Good morning, mam!" and "How do you do, Miss Minnie?" Once he even brought himself to say, bowing slightly and removing his hat, "And a good morning to you, little lady.''</p> <p>And soon, as if they had at last come into each other's orbit, they met face-to-face again. It was a fine fall afternoon, and Tol happened to be driving down past Goforth School, slowing his team, of course, so as not to disturb the concentration of the scholars inside. Miss Minnie was standing by the pump in front of the school-house, her figure making a neat blue silhouette against the dingy weatherboarding.</p> <p>Again she smiled at him. She said, "How do you do, Mr. Proudfoot?"</p> <p>And Tol startled at the sound of her voice as if he had not seen her there at all. He could not remember one of the pleasantries he had invented to say to her. He looked intently into the sky ahead of him and said quickly as if he had received a threat, "Why, howdy!"</p> <p>The conversation thus established was a poor thing, Tol knew, so far as his own participation in it went, but it was something to go on. It gave him hope. And now I want to tell you how this courtship, conducted for so long in secret in Tol's mind alone, became public. This is the story of Miss Minnie's first consent, the beginning of their story together, which is one of the dear possessions of the history of Port William.</p> <p>That fall, Miss Minnie and her students had worked hard in preparation for the annual Harvest Festival at the school. The Harvest Festival was Miss Minnie's occasion; she had thought it up herself. It might have been a Halloween party, except that Halloween in that vicinity got enough out of hand as it was without some public function to bring all the boys together in one place. And so she had thought of the Harvest Festival, which always took place two weeks before Halloween. It was a popular social event, consisting of much visiting, a display of the students' work, recitations by the students, an auction of pies and cakes to raise money for books and supplies, and abundant refreshments provided by the mothers of the students.</p> <p>Ptolemy Proudfoot had never been to the Harvest Festival. He had no children, he told himself, and so did not belong there. But in fact he had always longed to go, had always been afraid to intrude himself without excuse into Miss Minnie's world, and had always, as a result, spent an unhappy night at home. But this year, now that he and Miss Minnie were in a manner of becoming friends, he determined that he would go.</p> <p>Tol had got along as bachelors must. He had even become a fair cook. From the outside, his house was one of the prettiest and best kept in the neighborhood. It was a small house with steep, gingerbreaded gables, and it stood under two white oaks in the bend of the road, just before it turned down into the Katy's Branch valley where Goforth School was. Tol kept the house painted and the yard neat, and he liked to turn in off the road and say to himself, "Well, now, I wonder who lives in such a nice place!" But what he had thought up to do to the inside of the house was not a great deal above what he had thought up to do to the inside of his barn. Like the barn, the house was clean and orderly, but when he went into it, it did not seem to be expecting him, as it did after Miss Minnie came to live there.</p> <p>On the day of the festival, Tol cut and shocked corn all day, but he thought all day of the festival, too, and he quit early. He did his chores, fixed' his supper and ate it, and then, just as he had planned in great detail to do, he began to get ready. He brought his Sunday clothes to the kitchen and laid them out on a chair. He hunted up his Sunday shoes and polished them. He set a large washtub on the floor in front of the stove, dipped hot water into it from the water well at the end of the stove, cooled the hot water with water from the water bucket on the shelf by the door, put soap and washrag and towel on the floor beside the tub. And then he undressed and sat in the tub with his feet outside it on the floor, and scrubbed himself thoroughly from top to toe. He dried himself and put on his pants. Gazing into the mirror over the little wash table by the back door, he shaved so carefully that he cut himself in several places. He put on his shirt, and after several tries buttoned the collar. He put on his tie, tying a knot in it that would have broken the neck of a lesser man and that left even him so nearly strangled that he supposed he must look extremely hand-some. He wet his hair and combed it so that when it dried it stuck up stiffly in the air as Proudfoot hair was inclined to do. He put on his suspenders, his gleaming shoes, and his Sunday hat. And then he sat in a chair and sweated and rubbed his hands together until it was time to hitch old Ike to the buggy and drive down to the school.</p> <p>Before he got to the schoolhouse, he could hear voices, an uninterrupted babble like the sound of Katy's Branch in the spring, and then he could see a glow. When he got to the bottom of the hill and saw, among the trunks of the big walnuts and water maples and sycamores that stood there, the schoolhouse windows gleaming and the school yard strung with paper lanterns, lighting the bare-worn ground and throwing the shadows of the trees out in all directions like the spokes of a wheel, he said, "Whoa, Ike." The light around the old school-house and within it seemed to him a radiance that emanated from the person of Miss Minnie herself. And Tol's big heart quaked within him. He had to sit there in the road behind his stopped horse and think a good while before he could decide not to go on by, pretending to have an errand elsewhere.</p> <p>Now that he had stopped, it became quiet where he was; he could hear the crickets singing, and he was aware of Willow Hole on Katy's Branch, in the enclosure of trees beyond the school, carrying on its accustomed business in the dark. As he sat and thought&#x2015;thought hard about nothing that he could fix in a thought&#x2015;Tol slid his fingers up beneath his hat from time to time and scratched, and then jerked the hat down firmly onto his head again, and each time he did this he rotated the front</p></p><h2>The Last Great Senate: Courage and Statesmanship in Times of Crisis</h2><p>Journalists have called the U.S. Senate an empty chamber; politicians have lamented that the institution is broken&#x2014;yet the Senate was once capable of greatness.

Josef Breuer, one of the founding fathers of psychoanalysis, is at the height of his career. Friedrich Nietzsche, Europe's greatest philosopher, is on the brink of suicidal despair, unable to find a cure for the headaches and other ailments that plague him. </p> <p> When he agrees to treat Nietzsche with his experimental "talking cure," Breuer never expects that he too will find solace in their sessions. Only through facing his own inner demons can the gifted healer begin to help his patient. In <i>When Nietzsche Wept</i>, Irvin Yalom blends fact and fiction, atmosphere and suspense, to unfold an unforgettable story about the redemptive power of friendship. </p></p><p><p> Irvin D. Yalom, M.D., is the author of <i>The Schopenhauer Cure</i>, <i>Lying on the Couch</i>, <i>Every Day Gets a Little Closer</i>, and <i>Love's Executioner</i>, as well as several classic textbooks on psychotherapy. <i>When Nietzsche Wept</i> was a bestseller in Germany, Israel, Greece, Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil with millions of copies sold worldwide. Yalom is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at Stanford University, and he divides his practice between Palo Alto, where he lives, and San Francisco, California. </p>Freud's mentor, Josef Breuer, attempts to cure Friedrich Nietzsche of suicidal despair in the clinics, cemeteries, and coffeehouses of 19th-century Vienna--in this first novel by the author of the bestselling Love's Executioner: an entertaining and highly original tale of an uncompromising friendship between two brilliant men. Distinguished physician, renowned scientist, beloved husband and father, Josef Breuer finds himself at 40 simultaneously at the crest of his professional life and near the bottom of a pit of incomprehensible despair. Cursed with nightmares, insomnia, and obsessive sexual fantasies of his former patient, Anna O. (whom he cured, miraculously if temporarily, through a new technique called ``talk therapy''), Breuer welcomes the distraction when the imperious future psychoanalyst Lou Salom&#x201a; demands that he use talk therapy to cure the suicidal depression of her friend, Friedrich Nietzsche. Because the poverty-ridden, unknown philosopher is too proud to accept spiritual help from anyone, Breuer must somehow cure the younger man without his knowledge--but the physician welcomes the challenge, and soon solves it by posing as the patient himself and begging Nietzsche's help in relieving his own existential pain. Unable to refuse, dour Nietzsche agrees to embark on a month of daily ``talks'' with the physician. The ensuing dialogue between a man of the world and an unworldly man becomes increasingly compelling as first Breuer, then Nietzsche, uncovers his forgotten past and delves deep into his own and the other's unconscious desires and fears. Throughout, Yalom's evocation of Breuer imprisoned in a classic midlife crisis, Nietzsche stymied by his own pride, loneliness, and terror, Lou Salom&#x201a; cracking her feminist whip, and young Sigmund Freud eagerly following each conversation's twists and turns make for a stimulating dip into the pools of 19th-century philosophy, psychology, and culture. A delectable fantasy--in which the sole disappointment is that it didn't actually occur. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Why pay for new?</p><p>R.D. Laing, one of the best-known psychiatrists of modern times, was born in Glasgow in 1927 and graduated from Glasgow University as a doctor of medicine. In the 1960&#39;s he developed the argument that there may be a benefit in allowing acute mental and emotional turmoil in depth to go on and have its way, and that the outcome of such turmoil could have a positive value. He was the first to put such a stand to the test by establishing, with others, residences where persons could live and be free to let happen what will when the acute psychosis is given free rein, or where, at the very least, they receive no treatment they do not want. This work with the Philadelphia Association since 1964, together with his focus on disturbed and disturbing types of interaction in institutions, groups and families, has been both influential and continually controversial. R.D. Laing&#39;s writings range from books on social theory to verse, as well as numerous articles and reviews in scientific journals and the popular press. His publications are: The Divided Self, Self and Others, Interpersonal Perception (with H. Phillipson and A. Robin Lee), Reason and Violence (introduced by Jean-Paul Sartre), Sanity, Madness and the Family (with A. Esterson), The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise, Knots, The Politics of the Family, The Facts of Life, Do You Love Me?, Conversations with Children, Sonnets, The Voice of Experience and Wisdom, Madness and Folly. R.D. Laing died in 1989.

Laing.&#34;</p><h2>Dhalgren</h2><p>In <b>Dhalgren</b><i>,</i> perhaps one of the most profound and bestselling science fiction novels of all time, Samuel R. Delany has produced a novel "to stand with the best American fiction of the 1970s" (Jonathan Lethem).<br><br>Bellona is a city at the dead center of the United States. Something has happened there�&#x20ac;�. The population has fled. Madmen and criminals wander the streets. Strange portents appear in the cloud-covered sky. And into this disaster zone comes a young man�&#x20ac;&#x201c;poet, lover, and adventurer�&#x20ac;&#x201c;known only as the Kid. Tackling questions of race, gender, and sexuality, <b>Dhalgren</b> is a literary marvel and groundbreaking work of American magical realism.</p><p>What is <i>Dhalgren</i>? <i>Dhalgren</i> is one of the greatest novels of 20th-century American literature. <i>Dhalgren</i> is one of the all-time bestselling science fiction novels. <i>Dhalgren</i> may be read with equal validity as SF, magic realism, or metafiction. <i>Dhalgren</i> is controversial, challenging, and scandalous. <i>Dhalgren</i> is a brilliant novel about sex, gender, race, class, art, and identity.<p> A mysterious disaster has stricken the midwestern American city of Bellona, and its aftereffects are disturbing: a city block burns down and is intact a week later; clouds cover the sky for weeks, then part to reveal two moons; a week passes for one person when only a day passes for another. The catastrophe is confined to Bellona, and most of the inhabitants have fled. But others are drawn to the devastated city, among them the Kid, a white/American Indian man who can't remember his own name. The Kid is emblematic of those who live in the new Bellona, who are the young, the poor, the mad, the violent, the outcast--the marginalized.</p><p> <i>Dhalgren</i> is many things, but instantly accessible isn't one of them. While most of this big, ambitious, deeply detailed novel is beautifully pellucid, the opening pages will be difficult for some: the novel starts with the second half of an incomplete sentence, in the viewpoint of a man who doesn't know who he is. If you find the early pages rough going, push on; the story soon becomes clear and fascinating. But--fair warning--the central nature of the disaster, of its strange devastations and disruptions, remains a puzzle for many readers, sometimes after several readings.</p><p> Spoiler warning: If you want to figure out the secret of the novel as you read <i>Dhalgren</i>, then stop reading this review right now! If you want to know the secret before you start, this is what the novel is about: the experience of existence inside a novel. Time passes differently for different characters. A river changes location. Stairs change their number. The Kid looks in a mirror and sees not himself, but someone who looks an awful lot like Samuel R. Delany. Central images include mirrors, lenses, and prisms, devices that focus, reflect--and distort. The Kid fills a notebook with a journal that may be <i>Dhalgren</i>, and is uncertain if he has written much, or any, of it. The characters don't know they're in a novel, but they know something is wrong. <i>Dhalgren</i> explores the relationship between characters and author (or, perhaps, characters, "author," and author).</p><p> The final chapter can be even tougher going than the opening pages, with its viewpoint change and its stretches of braided narrative--and the novel ends with the beginning of an unfinished sentence. But the last chapter becomes clear as you persevere; and when you get to that unfinished closing line, turn to the first line of the novel to finish the sentence and close the narrative circle. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>5 1/4 x 8 1/2 trim.

The breadth of the collection makes these 37 stories an extremely complete map of Carver territory, of a particular area of America and of the specific texture of the people Carver writes about -- their difficult attempts at survival in a world where happiness does not arrive wrapped up in neat packages but comes in far more peculiar parcels, if it comes at all.By the time of his early death in 1988, Raymond Carver had established himself as one of the great practitioners of the American short story, a writer who had not only found his own voice but imprinted it in the imagination of thousands of readers. <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer calls Raymond Carver "one of the great short story writers of our time-of any time" and The New York Times Book Review says his stories "can already be counted among the masterpieces of American fiction." Where I'm Calling From contains thirty-seven of his best works and reflects Carver's development as a writer over a period of more than two decades. </p><p>In his introduction to this selection, Carver noted V. S. Pritchett's definition of a short story as "something glimpsed from the corner of the eye, in passing." Carver elaborated: "First the glimpse. The glimpse given life, turned into something that will illuminate the moment and just maybe lock it indelibly into the reader's consciousness. Make it a part of the reader's own experience, as Hemingway so nicely put it. Forever, the writer hopes. Forever." This essential work shows beyond all doubt that Carver's hope has been triumphantly fulfilled. </p><p>"Considered as an extended work, the book summarizes Carver's writing career and testifies to a literary achievement equaled only by the very best of modern American story writers-Hemingway, Welty, Salinger, Cheever. . . . Where he is calling from is the innermost region of the heart."-San Francisco Chronicle </p><p>"The great gift of this realist (no minimalist he) is the beauty of his best stories, in which a sort of bafflement is the buffer against very ordinary lives."-The New York Times </p><p>"Where I'm Calling From is the closest thing to definitive Carver."-The Baltimore Sun </p><p>"The stories streamline and order and heighten experience in such a way that makes everyday life look both chaotic and relatively benign, and so, in its way, Carver's fiction reassures. Set next to standard-issue American heroes, these characters may be jerks, losers, flops, sad-sacks, bums and chumps, but within each is a spark of caring. This human quality impels us into the center of every Carver story."-Chicago Tribune </p><p>"Powerful, evocative . . . A good representation of a modern master. If you're going to own one book by Carver, this should be it."-Cleveland Plain Dealer </p><p>"[These stories] overflow with the danger, excitement, mystery and possibility of life. . . . Carver is a writer of astonishing compassion and honesty, his eye set on describing and revealing the world as he sees it. his eye is so clear, it almost breaks your heart."-The Washington Post Book World </p><p>"Astonishing achievements, which bespeak a writer expanding his range and intentions."-The Boston Globe </p><p>"Written in the simplest of styles, mirroring the language of everyday, his stories possess an awesome, mesmerizing power. Out of the moments when good luck runs out, Carver makes the highest art."-Newsday</p></p><h2>The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present</h2><p><i>The Rhetorical Tradition</i> �&#x20ac;&#x201d; the first comprehensive anthology of primary texts covering the history of rhetoric �&#x20ac;&#x201d; examines rhetorical theory from classical antiquity through the modern period.

Then, with great suddenness, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, judges and lawyers on the right found a voice and an agenda. Their goals reflected and reinforced the political goals of the conservative wing of the Republican Party.<br><br>Earl Warren, who served as chief justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969, exerted a powerful and lasting influence over American law. The former California governor, who was appointed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, put the fight against state-sponsored racism at the heart of his agenda. Starting in 1954, with <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, which outlawed segregation in public education, the justices began more than a dozen years of sustained, and usually unanimous, pressure against the forces of official segregation. Within the legal profession in particular, Warren's record on civil rights gave him tremendous moral authority. Warren and his colleagues, especially William J. Brennan Jr., his close friend and strategist, used that capital to push the law in more liberal directions in countless other areas as well. On freedom of speech, on the rights of criminal suspects, on the emerging field of privacy, the Warren Court transformed American law.<br><br>To be sure, Warren faced opposition, but many of his Court's decisions quickly worked their way into the permanent substructure of American law. <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</i>, which protected newspapers that published controversial speech; <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>, which established new rules for interrogating criminal suspects; even <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, which announced a right of married people to buy birth control, under the broader heading of privacy&#x2013;all these cases, along with the Warren Court's many pronouncements on race, became unassailable precedents.<br><br>Richard M. Nixon won the presidency in part by promising to rein in the liberalism of the Court, but even though he had the good fortune to name four justices in three years, the law itself wound up little changed. Under Warren E. Burger, whom Nixon named to succeed Warren, the Court in some respects became more liberal than ever. It was under Burger that the court approved the use of school busing, expanded free speech well beyond <i>Sullivan</i>, forced Nixon himself to turn over the Watergate tapes, and even, for a time, ended all executions in the United States. <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the abortion rights decision that still defines judicial liberalism, passed by a 7-2 vote in 1973, with three of the four Nixon nominees (Burger, Lewis F. Powell, and Harry A. Blackmun) in the majority. Only Rehnquist, joined by Byron R. White, appointed by John F. Kennedy, dissented.<br><br>Through all these years--from the 1950s through the 1970s&#x2013;the conservatives on the Court like White and Potter Stewart did not differ greatly from their liberal colleagues. The conservatives were less willing to second-guess the work of police officers and to reverse criminal convictions; they were more willing to limit remedies for past racial discrimination; they deferred somewhat more to elected officials about how to organize and run the government. But on the big legal questions, the war was over, and the liberals had won. And their victories went&nbsp; beyond the judgments of the Supreme Court. The Warren Court transformed virtually the entire legal culture, especially law schools.<br><br>***<br><br>It was not surprising, then, that on the day after Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, Yale Law School went into mourning. On that day, Steven Calabresi's torts professor canceled class to talk about what was happening in the country. The mood in the room was one of bewilderment and hurt. At the end, the teacher asked for a show of hands among the ninety first-year students before him. How many had voted for Carter and how many for Reagan? Only Calabresi and one other student had supported the Republican.<br><br>The informal poll revealed a larger truth about law schools at the time. Most professors at these institutions were liberal, a fact that reflected changes that had taken place in the profession as a whole. The left-leaning decisions of the Warren and Burger Courts had become a reigning orthodoxy, and support among faculty for such causes as affirmative action and abortion rights was overwhelming.<br><br>But even law schools were not totally immune from the trends that were pushing the nation's politics to the right, and a small group of students like Calabresi decided to turn these inchoate tendencies into something more enduring. Along with Lee Liberman and David McIntosh, two friends from Yale College who had gone on to law school at the University of Chicago, Calabresi decided to start an organization that would serve as a platform to discuss and advocate conservative ideas in legal thought. They considered several names that would showcase their erudition&#x2013;"The Ludwig von Mises Society," and "The Alexander Bickel Society"&#x2013;but they settled on a more elegant choice. They called themselves the Federalist Society, after the early American patriots who fought for the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. Calabresi's guide on the Yale Law School faculty was Professor Robert Bork. Liberman and McIntosh started a Federalist branch at Chicago and recruited as their first faculty adviser a professor named Antonin Scalia.<br><br>The idea for a conservative legal organization was perfectly timed, and not just because of the Republican ascendancy in electoral politics. In this period, liberalism may have been supreme at law schools, but it was hardly an intellectually dynamic force. In the 1960s, liberal scholars at Yale and elsewhere were writing the law review articles that gave intellectual heft to the decisions of the Warren Court, but by the eighties, the failures of the Carter administration turned many traditional Democrats away from the practical realities of law to a more exotic passion--advocating (or decrying) a movement known as Critical Legal Studies. Drawing heavily on the work of thinkers like the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and the French poststructuralist Jacques Derrida, CLS devotees attacked the idea that law could be a system of neutral principles, or even one that could create a fairer and more just society. Rather, they viewed law mainly as a tool of oppression that the powerful used against the weak. Whatever its ultimate merits, CLS was singularly inconsequential outside the confines of law schools, its nihilism and extremism rendering it largely irrelevant to the work of judges and lawmakers. At law schools, then, the field was largely open for a vigorous conservative insurgency.<br><br>So the Federalist Society both reflected and propelled the growth of the conservative movement. It held its first national conference in 1982, and by the following year there were chapters in more than a dozen law schools. Recognizing the intellectual potential of the society, conservative organizations like the John M. Olin and Scaife foundations made important early grants that allowed the Federalists to establish a full-time office in Washington. The Reagan administration began hiring Federalist members as staffers and, of course, appointing them as judicial nominees, with Bork and Scalia as the most famous examples. (Bork and Scalia both went on the D.C. Circuit in 1982. Calabresi himself went on to be a professor of law at Northwestern.)<br><br>The young Federalists who started organizing in the early eighties did not merely strive to recapitulate the tactics of their conservative elders. The prior generation, those who waged their decorous battle against the extremes of the Warren Court, preferred "judicial restraint" to "judicial activism." For conservatives like Justices Stewart or John Marshall Harlan II, who were two frequent dissenters from Warren Court decisions, the core idea was that judges should defer to the democratic branches of government and thus resist the temptation to overturn statutes or veto the actions of government officials. But the new generation of conservatives had more audacious goals. Indeed, they did not believe in judicial restraint, and they represented a new kind of judicial activism themselves. They believed that constitutional law had taken some profoundly wrong turns, and they were not shy about demanding that the courts take the lead in restoring the rightful order.<br><br>***<br><br>With the election of Ronald Reagan, conservative ideas suddenly had important new sponsors in Washington. Reagan was elected on promises of shrinking the federal government, which he proposed to do by cutting the budgets for social programs. Many in the Federalist Society sought a legal route to the same goal. Back in 1905, the Supreme Court had said in <i>Lochner v. New York</i> that a law that set a maximum number of hours for bakers was unconstitutional because it violated the bakers' freedom of contract under the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of "liberty" and "property." By the 1940s, the Roosevelt appointees to the Supreme Court had repudiated the "<i>Lochner</i> era," and for decades no one had seriously suggested that there might be constitutional limits on the scope of the federal government's power. Then, suddenly, in the Reagan years, some conservatives started questioning that wisdom and asserting that much of what the federal government did was unconstitutional. (The second event ever sponsored by the Federalist Society was a speech at Yale in 1982 by Professor Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago Law School in favor of <i>Lochner v. New York</i>.) While Reagan was arguing that Congress <i>should not</i> pass regulations, the Federalists were saying that, under the Constitution, Congress <i>could not</i>.<br><br>Edwin Meese III, Reagan's attorney general in his second term, provided a framework for the emerging conservative critique of the Warren and Burger era when he cal...</p><h2>A Case Of Need</h2><p>When a surgeon is accused of murdering a patient, John Berry, a pathologist, investigates in hopes of getting to the bottom of the mysterious death, and discovers that his own life is in danger</p><p>Michael Crichton was a writer and filmmaker, best known as the author of Jurassic Park and the creator of ER.

At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C. S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the worldly-wise old devil to his nephew Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man. <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> is the most engaging account of temptation -- and triumph over it -- ever written, offering insights on good vs. evil, repentance, grace, and more.</p><p>This adaptation of C.S. Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known. But judging from his final signoff -- "Your increasingly and ravenously affectionate uncle" -- his appetite for evil has not lessened.</p></p><h2>Ascension: Star Wars Legends (Fate of the Jedi) (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi - Legends)</h2><p><b><i>How long can the Jedi remain in power?</i></b><br><b><i>How far will the Sith go to rule supreme?</i></b><br><b><i>What chance do both stand against Abeloth?</i></b><br><br>As Luke and Ben Skywalker pursue the formidable dark-side being Abeloth, the Lost Tribe of the Sith is about to be sundered by an even greater power&#x2014;which will thrust one Dark Lord into mortal conflict with his own flesh-and-blood.<br><br>On Coruscant, a political vacuum has left tensions at the boiling point, with factions racing to claim control of the Galactic Alliance.

Yet it was not hot in this large room; regulating the temperature was child's play for such masterful users of the Force as the Sith assembled here.<br><br>It was an emergency meeting. Even so, formalities were strictly observed; the Sith were nothing if not meticulous. Grand Lord Darish Vol, the leader of the Lost Tribe, had summoned the meeting less than a standard hour earlier. He now sat upon a dais in the very center of the room, elevated above all others, enthroned on his traditional metal-and-glass seat. While there had been sufficient time to don his colorful formal robes, he had not had time to sit and permit his attendants to paint his gaunt, aged face with the vor'shandi swirls and decorations appropriate to the meeting. Vol shifted slightly in his throne, displeased by that knowledge, displeased with the entire situation that had necessitated the meeting in the first place.<br><br>His staff of office was stretched over his lap. His ?claw-?like hands closed about it as his aged but still-sharp eyes flitted about the room, noting who was here and who was not, and observing and anticipating the responses of each.<br><br>Seated on either side of the Grand Lord were the High Lords. Nine members of the traditional thirteen were here today, a mixture of male and female, Keshiri and human. One, High Lord Sarasu Taalon, would never again be among that number. Taalon was dead, and his death was one of the reasons Vol had called the assembly. Seated in a ring around the dais were the Lords, ranked below the High Lords, and standing behind them were the Sabers.<br><br>Several of their number were missing, too. Many were dead. Some . . . well, their status remained to be seen.<br><br>Vol could feel the tension in the room; even a non-Force-sensitive could have read the body language. Anger, worry, anticipation, and apprehension were galloping through the Chambers today, even though most present hid it well. Vol drew upon the Force as naturally as breathing in order to regulate his heart rate and the stress-created chemicals that coursed through his body. This was how the mind remained clear, even though the heart was, as ever, open to emotions and passion. If it were closed, or unmoved by such things, it would no longer be the heart of a true Sith.<br><br>"I tell you, she is a savior!" Lady Sashal was saying. She was petite, her long white hair perfectly coiffed, and her purple skin the most pleasing tone of lavender; her mellifluous voice rang through the room. "Ship obeys her, and was not Ship the-" She stumbled on the choice of words for a moment, then recovered. "-the Sith-created construct who liberated us from the chains of our isolation and ignorance of the galaxy? Ship was the tool we used to further our ? destiny-?to conquer the stars. We are well on our way to doing so!"<br><br>"Yes, Lady Sashal, we are," countered High Lord Ivaar Workan. "But it is we who shall rule this galaxy, not this stranger."<br><br>Although the attractive, graying human male had been a Lord for many years, he was new to his rank of High Lord. Taalon's untimely demise had paved the way for Workan's promotion. Vol had enjoyed watching Workan step into the role as if he had been born to it. While Sith truly trusted no one but themselves and the Force, Vol nonetheless regarded Workan among those who fell on the side of less likely to betray him.<br><br>"She is very strong with the dark side," High Lord Takaris Yur offered. "Stronger than anyone we have ever heard of." That was quite a statement, coming from the Master of the Sith Temple. Few on Kesh had as extensive a knowledge of the Sith's past-and now their present as they expanded across the stars-as this deceptively mild, ?dark-? skinned, middle-aged human. Yur had ambition, but, oddly for a Sith, it was largely not personal. His ambitions were for his students. He was content to teach them as best he could, then set them loose on an unsuspecting world, turning his attention to the next generation of Tyros. Yur spoke seldom, but when he did, all listened, if they were wise.<br><br>"Stronger than I?" said Vol mildly, his face pleasant, as if he were engaged in idle chitchat on a lovely summer's day.<br><br>Yur was unruffled as he turned ?toward the Grand Lord, bowing as he replied.<br><br>"She is an ancient being," he said. "It seems to me foolish not to learn what we can from her." Vol smiled a little; Yur had not actually answered the question.<br><br>"One may learn much about a rukaro by standing in its path," Vol continued. "But one might not survive to benefit from that knowledge."<br><br>"True," Yur agreed. "Nonetheless, she is useful. Let us suck her dry before discarding the husk. Reports indicate that she still has much knowledge and skill in manipulating the Force to teach us and future generations of the Lost Tribe."<br><br>"She is not Sith," said Workan. The scorn in his melodious voice indicated that that single, damning observation should be the end of the debate.<br><br>"She is!" Sashal protested.<br><br>"Not the way we are Sith," Workan continued. "And our ?way-?our culture, our values, our heritage-must be the only way if our destiny is to remain pure and unsullied. We risk dooming ourselves by becoming overly reliant on someone not of the ?Tribe-?no matter how powerful she might be."<br><br>"Sith take what we want," said Sashal, stepping ?toward Workan. Vol watched both of them closely, idly wondering if Sashal was issuing a challenge to her superior. It would be foolish. She was nowhere near as powerful as Workan. But sometimes ambition and wisdom did not go hand in hand.<br><br>Her full diminutive height was drawn up, and she projected great confidence in the Force. "We will take her, and use her, and discard her when we are done. But for love of the dark side, let us take her first! Listen to High Lord Yur! Think what we can learn! From all that we have heard, she has powers we cannot imagine!"<br><br>"From all that we have heard, she is unpredictable and dangerous," countered Workan. "Only a fool rides the uvak he cannot control. I've no desire to continue to sacrifice Sith Sabers and Lords on the altar of aiding Abeloth and furthering her agenda-whatever it might be. Or have you failed to realize that we don't even truly know what that is?"<br><br>Vol detected a slight sense of worry and urgency from the figure currently approaching the Circle Chambers. It was Saber Yasvan, her attractive features drawn in a frown of concern.<br><br>"Only a fool throws away a weapon that still has use," countered Yur. "Something so ancient-we should string her along and unlock her secrets."<br><br>"Our numbers are finite, Lord Yur," Workan said. "At the rate Sith are dying interacting with her, we won't be around to learn very much."<br><br>Vol listened as Yasvan whispered in his ear, then nodded and, with a ? liver-?spotted hand, dismissed the Saber.<br><br>"Entertaining as this debate has been," he said, "it is time for it to conclude. I have just learned that Ship has made contact with our planetary defenses. Abeloth and the Sith I have sent to accompany her will not be far behind."<br><br>They had all known to expect her; it was, indeed, the reason the meeting had been called. All eyes turned to him expectantly. What would their Grand Lord decide?<br><br>He let them stew. He was old, and few things amused him these days, so he permitted himself to enjoy the moment. At last, he said, "I have heard the arguments for continuing to work closely with her, and the arguments to sever ties. While I confess I am not overly fond of the former, and have made little secret of my opinion, neither do I think it is time for the latter. The best way to win is to cover all angles of the situation. And so Kesh and the Circle of Lords will invite Abeloth to our world. We shall give her a grand welcome, with feasting, and arts, and displays of our proud and powerful culture. And," he added, eyeing them all intently, "we will watch, and learn, and listen. And then we will make our decision as to what is best for the Lost Tribe of Kesh."<br><br>Sith Saber Gavar Khai sat in the captain's chair on the bridge of the Black Wave, the ChaseMaster frigate that had once belonged to Sarasu Taalon. Filling the viewscreen was the spherical shape of his homeworld-green and brown and blue and lavender. Khai regarded the lush planet with heavy-lidded eyes. For so many years, Kesh had been isolated from the events of the galaxy, and Khai found he had decidedly mixed feelings about returning.<br><br>Part of him was glad to be home. As was the case with every member of the Lost Tribe, he had spent his entire life here until a scant two years ago. Deeply embedded in him were love for its beautiful glass sculptures and purple sands, its music and culture, its casual brutality and its orderliness. For more than five thousand standard years, the Tribe had dwelled here, and with no other option, had-as was the Sith way-made the best of it. The ancient vessel Omen had crash-landed, and the survivors had set about not merely to exist in this world, but to dominate it. And so they had. They had managed to both embrace the Keshiri, the beautiful native beings of Kesh, and subjugate them. Those who were deserving-strong in the Force and able to adapt to the Sith way of thinking and being-could, with enough will, carve out a place for themselves in this society.<br><br>Those who were not Force-users had no such opportunities. They were at the mercy of the ones who ruled. And sometimes, as was the case with Gavar Khai and his wife, there was mercy. Even love.<br><br>But most often, there was neither.<br><br>Too, those who gambled to increase their standing and power and lost seldom lived long enough to make a second attempt. It was a very controlled society, with precise roles. Everyone knew what was expected of him or her, and knew that in order to change their lot, they would need to be bold, clever, and lucky.<br><br>Gavar Khai had been all of those things.<br><br>His life on Kesh had been good. While, of course, he had his eye on eventually becoming a Lord-perhaps even a High Lord, if opportunities presented themselves or could be manipulated-?he was not discontent with where he was. His wife, though not a Force-user, supported him utterly. She had been faithful and devoted and raised their tremendously promising daughter, Vestara, very well.<br><br>And Vestara had been the most precious of all the things that had belonged to Gavar Khai.<br><br>Discipline was something every Sith child tasted almost upon emerging from the womb. It was the duty of the parents to mold their children well, otherwise they would be unprepared to claim their proper roles in society. Beatings were the norm, but they were seldom motivated by anger. They were part of the way that Sith parents guided and taught their children. Khai had not looked forward to such aspects of discipline, preferring to explore other methods such as meditation, sparring till exhaustion, and withholding approval.<br><br>He had found, to his pleasure, that he had never needed to lay a hand on Vestara in reprimand. She was seemingly born to excel, and had her own drive and ambition such that she did not need his to "encourage" her. Khai, of course, had goals and ambitions for himself.<br><br>He had greater ones for his daughter. Or at least, he'd had.<br><br>His reverie was broken by the sound of the comm beeping, indicating a message from the surface.<br><br>"Message from Grand Lord Vol, Saber Khai," said his second in command, Tola Annax, adding quietly under her breath, "Very prompt, very prompt indeed."<br><br>"I expected as much, once he received my message," Khai said. "I will speak with him."<br><br>A hologram of the wizened Grand Lord appeared. It had been some time since Khai had seen the leader of the Lost Tribe. Had Vol always seemed so fragile, so . . . old? Age was to be respected, for to live to an old age meant a Sith had done something very right indeed. But there was such a thing as too old, and those who were too old needed to be put down. Idly, keeping his thoughts well shielded, Khai wondered if the renowned Grand Lord was getting to that point. He saw his white-haired Keshiri second in command staring openly at the hologram; doubtless Annax, with her near obsession for determining weakness, was thinking the same thing.<br><br>"Saber Gavar Khai," said Vol, and his voice certainly sounded strong. "I had expected to speak to Abeloth herself."<br><br>"She is on Ship at the moment. Do not worry, you will see her when she arrives on Kesh," Khai said smoothly. "She is anxious to create a good first impression."<br><br>"I take it that since you are the one speaking to me, she has selected you to replace the late High Lord Taalon in our . . . interactions with her."<br><br>"It has not been said specifically, no, but yes, Abeloth has turned to me since Lord Taalon's death."<br><br>"Good, good. Please then assure Abeloth that as she is anxious to create a good first impression, after our people have worked so closely and sacrificed so much for her, we are also desirous that our first meeting go well. To that end, we will need time to prepare for such an august visitor. Say, three days. A parade, showcasing the glory that is the Lost Tribe, and then a masquerade."<br><br>Khai knew a trap when he saw one. As did Annax-who quickly busied herself with her controls so as not to look too obvious as she listened in-and the rest of his crew. As traps went, this was blatant. Vol was testing Khai's loyalties. To force Abeloth to wait three full days before being received was to tell her her place. To keep her waiting, as one might a Tyro summoned for interrogation about his studies. Yet Vol would deny such, simply saying that he wanted to make sure everything was just right for their esteemed guest. And with the Sith's love of ceremony and showcasing, the statement had the dubious merit of perhaps even being true.<br><br>Vol was waiting for Khai's reaction. He was trying to figure out where the Saber's loyalties lay.<br><br>And Khai himself suddenly realized, with a sickly jolt, that he himself ?didn't know.<br><br>Abeloth had doubtless sensed the conversation and was monitoring Khai's presence in the Force. For all he knew about Ship, she also had the ability to monitor the conversation itself. He addressed himself calmly to the man who ostensibly ruled the Lost Tribe of the Sith.<br><br>"Abeloth will be disappointed to hear that preparations will take so long," he said, keeping his voice modulated. "She might even see it as an insult." Out of Vol's line of sight, Annax was nodding.</p><h2>Naturopathic Handbook of Herbal Formulas: A Practical and Concise Herb User&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p>Explains the important differences between synthetic medicines and whole plant extracts on the human physiology.</p> <p>Provides a detailed botanical dispensatory guide listing beneficial plant compounds, therapeutic actions, indications, dosages, and contraindications. <b>This section is intended for the professional use of botanical formulas.</b></p> <p>Provides a clinical botanical repertory divided into the major systems of the body.

Noting that crime has dropped in urban areas over the past decade, she writes that "The last ten years should have been a time of triumph for law enforcement, not an occasion for frenzied cop-bashing." Yet an anti-police stance has pervaded the media in recent years, particularly in <i>The New York Times</i>, she says. This bias, combined with suffocating federal regulations, brought about by both the Clinton and the Bush Justice Departments, threaten to reverse the progress made. It also causes unnecessary friction between police and the public, makes neighborhoods less safe, and even dissuades officers from fighting crime aggressively for fear of being labeled a racist. In instances where the police were clearly in the wrong--most notably the much-publicized and tragic Amadou Diallo shooting--Mac Donald posits that these are isolated cases of poor judgment and failure to follow procedure rather than evidence of systemic racism.<p> Since much of the profiling issue revolves around highway patrolling, Mac Donald looks closely at the misleading statistics that have been used to back up such practices as tabulating the race of drivers pulled over by the police. Mac Donald punches so many holes in the statistics that it's difficult not to concur with her. She further attacks the "collective fairy tale that all groups commit drug crimes at equal rates," arguing that the police are simply going to where the crime is, not willfully picking on one group while ignoring others. She also does extensive field work: interviewing cops around the country, particularly black officers who find the race-bias argument specious; reporting from urban neighborhoods; and witnessing firsthand how the New York Police Department trains its rookie officers. She also points out that local police are "the first line of defense against terrorism" and makes a particularly compelling argument that racial-profiling should be used as a tool in combating such threats. Overall, this forceful book is sure to arouse controversy--which is exactly the point. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Heather Mac Donald, a nonpracticing lawyer, is a John M.

America was at war. I was a healthy seventeen-year-old high school student, halfway through my senior year. My future was clear: I would graduate and when I turned eighteen in July, I would join whatever branch of the armed forces most of my buddies were choosing. That's exactly what happened, with one exception: I became a movie star first.&nbsp;As a clerk in the unemployment office in North Hollywood, my dad was used to seeing actors when they came in every week to collect their checks. There was the occasional grand one like Adolphe Menjou, who arrived in a chauffeured limousine each week to pick up his check, but most of them were just ordinary out-of-work actors waiting for their next paying job to come along. Dad became friendly with an actor who was far from ordinary. It was Harry Langdon, who had been one of the "Big Four," Hollywood's most beloved stars during the silent film era, along with Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin was the only one of the four who survived the transition to talkies. The others had fallen on differing degrees of hard times. Keaton and Lloyd eventually survived more successfully than Mr. Langdon. My dad had great admiration for his new friend, and eventually felt free enough with him to ask his advice about my dream of becoming an actor.&nbsp;After mulling it over for several weeks, Langdon told Dad about a small showcase theater on Highland Avenue in Hollywood that was run by Mary Stewart, a little-known actress with a lot of money and some talent. There was no permanent company, no set schedule. Each production that Miss Stewart managed to put on consisted of a pickup group of actors, most of them amateurs who would work for nothing in order to get the experience, and the credit, not to mention an opportunity to live the dream of being discovered.&nbsp;She was currently seeing young actors for The Wookie, an English play about Londoners during the blitz in World War II. At dinner that evening, my dad told us about it, and my mom agreed to take time off from her job at the five-and-ten-cent store to drive me to the theater the next day to find out how to go about trying out for a part.&nbsp;The next afternoon, Mom got off early and picked me up at school, and off we went. The theater was a nondescript auditorium with folding chairs, much like many of today's Off-Broadway theaters. Lucky for me, they were having an open audition, one to which amateurs, actors who were not yet members of Actors' Equity, were welcomed. The stage manager gave me some pages from different scenes and told me to go study them and come back in an hour. I returned to read for Miss Stewart and the director using a Cockney accent, which had to be awful, because it was something I'd just made up after reading the scenes. I had no frame of reference for the accent other than the few English movies I'd seen. There was a long silence after I finished, and then what sounded like a whispered argument between Miss Stewart and the director. After what seemed like an eternity, Miss Stewart came to the edge of the stage to congratulate me on getting the part. Even though in my na�vet� I had felt since childhood that it was my destiny to be an actor one day, I was in a state of shock when it happened.&nbsp;At our first read-through of The Wookie, I met the rest of the cast, including Percival Vivian, our English director, who was also playing the leading man. We all, with the exception of Miss Stewart and Mr. Vivian, had to double and triple parts. Three of the actors were old-timers who had been extras in the movies for years and regulars in Mary Stewart's productions. There was a young boy who was a brand-new member of Actors' Equity. The last two members of the company, a pretty young redhead named Connie Cornwall and I, had never set foot on a real stage before.&nbsp;Miss Stewart was grand, but she could not have been nicer to everyone. Percy, the director, often seemed as if he had it in for me. I had no idea why. Since he said he had been in London during the blitz, I hung on his every word as if they were graven in stone.&nbsp;After three weeks of rehearsing scenes, it was time to add the costumes, lighting, and sound effects. Technical rehearsals were very exciting, with the sounds of bombs going off and sirens and shouting all over the place. I had to run on and off, change coats, and return to the stage as someone else. It was exhilarating. After the final tech rehearsal, Percy called me over and said, "Good show, young man. Be at the dress rehearsal tomorrow a wee bit early, would you?" Before I could reply, he turned and walked off. I was so pleased by his compliment that I didn't ask why. I couldn't wait to comply.&nbsp;At the call for the dress rehearsal, I was in my costume, waiting outside his dressing room, when he arrived. He said he wanted to show me how to make up. I was very excited to get this chance to learn something professional. He did a full character makeup with heavy lines for age and big dark circles under my eyes. I thought I looked just terrific. He had turned me into a character man! My favorite actors were always people like Frank Morgan and Bert Lahr in The Wizard of Oz, never the young leading men. After thanking him profusely, I ran back to my dressing room so that everyone could admire the new me. No one even looked up.&nbsp;The dress rehearsal went reasonably well except for a number of explosions in the wrong place, lots of collisions in the wings and backstage as we all tore on and off, and people forgetting their lines and or entrances. I, with my greasepaint, was letter- and traffic-pattern perfect. After we staged the curtain calls, Miss Stuart grabbed me by the hand and marched me back to her dressing room. She closed the door, turned to me, and, with a surprising lack of grandness, said, "Who put all that crap on your face!?" I told her that Percy had taught me how to do my makeup. She shook her head for a minute and started to laugh, "You tell that son of a bitch that if he ever lays another one of his dainty fingers on your face again, I'll cut them all off at the wrist! He just doesn't want anyone to be prettier than he is onstage. Now, go and scrub it all off. Do not wear any makeup tomorrow night. The last thing I want you to do is hide that face."&nbsp;Backstage the following evening, I thought I saw Percy scowling at me. When I went over to apologize to him for not wearing makeup, he gave me a pat on the back and a tight little smile as he said, "Break a leg, laddie." The house was filled with friends and admirers of Miss Stewart, and of all of us in the cast. What nobody knew was that an up-and-coming young talent agent named Phil Gersh was there with Bob McIntyre, the casting director for Samuel Goldwyn.&nbsp;Meeting Mr. Goldwyn&nbsp;My father had already left for work when our phone rang the next morning. It was Phil Gersh. After explaining who he was, he asked me if I could come in and see him as soon as possible about a movie. I thanked him and said of course I could. I was fairly calm about it, because I knew (same old na�vet�) that it was fate in action, but my mother was hysterical. She called my father, who had just arrived at work, and insisted that he come home immediately. Somehow he managed to get away from work. After I finished cleaning up and dressed in my best blazer, shirt, and good-luck tie, we headed for Mr. Gersh's office at the Goldstone Agency in Hollywood. My father told me to just keep quiet and listen. He would do all the talking.&nbsp;Mr. Gersh's secretary buzzed us into his office. He made us comfortable and got right to the point. He told us that he and the casting director for Sam Goldwyn had seen me in The Wookie, and thought I might be right for a part in a new movie that Mr. Goldwyn was producing. Would I be interested in trying out for it? "I sure would!" popped out of my mouth before my father could speak.&nbsp;Mr. Gersh laughed, and my father said, "We would certainly be interested in talking about it, Mr Gersh." They excused my mother and me, and a short time later came out beaming.&nbsp;Mr. Gersh said; "Welcome to the fold, Farley. I'm sure we'll be doing great things together." He then apologized for having another appointment and not being able to come with us. He promised that Mr. McIntyre would take good care of us at the studio, and that he would see us again soon.&nbsp;When we were out of earshot, I turned to my father. "What was he talking about? What studio? Where are we going? What did you talk about in there?"&nbsp;"I think he's a good man, Sonny, so I signed with him to be our agent." I resented the "our" and not having been a part of the conversation even more than I resented that nickname, something he had known for years, but I was too excited to spoil the event with an argument.&nbsp;We arrived at the Goldwyn Studio, and my name was at the gate. The guard directed us to the casting office. The studios were disappointingly drab and industrial-looking, mostly two-story gray stucco buildings with signs indicating what was inside. We found the casting office with no problem. There the secretary had me take a seat and politely told my eager stage parents that they would have to wait outside, which secretly delighted me. Bob McIntyre came out and took me into his office. He was a nice-looking older man, dressed like Robert Donat in Goodbye, Mr. Chips.&nbsp;After we sat down, he talked about seeing me in The Wookie the night before and how good he thought I was. When he asked me if I would like to act in a movie, I said, "You bet!"&nbsp;He smiled and asked me how old I was. When I told him seventeen, he said that the movie was about the life of a boy my age during the last forty-eight hours of peace and the first forty-eight hours of World War II in a Russian village called North Star. He gave me a couple of pages of a script and told me to go into the outer office and read it over. The part I was reading for was Damian. The scene was a very emotional one in which Damian was saying goodbye to the girl he loved because he was going off to fight with the resistance. She understood his decision, but was afraid he would be killed. After about ten minutes, Mr. McIntyre came out and asked if I was ready. I took a breath and nodded. He said we were going to a conference room to meet the three people I was going to read for: Mr. Goldwyn; Lillian Hellman, the writer of the movie; and Lewis Milestone, the director. By the time we got there, I was no longer calm.&nbsp;We entered a big room with nothing in it other than a long table with a lot of chairs around it. Three people were seated at the far end of the long table. Mr. McIntyre introduced me and quietly left. Mr. Goldwyn was tall, ramrod-straight, and healthy-looking, impeccably dressed in a steel-gray suit. He was bald with black eyebrows and ball-bearing eyes. He stood, nodded, and, in an incongruously thin, high-pitched voice said, "Mr. Granger." Miss Hellman, an ugly little lady wreathed in clouds of cigarette smoke, said nothing. Mr. Milestone, a friendly-looking, stocky middle-aged man, smiled at me and winked. He asked if I had any questions about the scene. I was afraid to ask anything, so I said, "No."&nbsp;As if on cue, a pretty young girl around my age appeared to read with me. Mr. Milestone introduced us and asked us to begin. We finished and no one said a word except Mr. Milestone, who came over, shook my hand, and thanked me for a job well done.&nbsp;I went back to Mr. McIntyre's office to find out what to do next, but he was in a meeting. His secretary told me, "Don't call us, we'll call you," and showed me the door. I was thrilled. They said they would call me, which echoed over and over in my head as I ran down the hall and out the door to inform my waiting parents, "They're going to call me!"&nbsp;More than a month, and a mild case of scarlatina, went by as my discouraged parents began to give up hope. I never doubted that the call would come, and thought the fact that it was taking so long was fate providing me with time to get over my rash. How was I to know that Lillian Hellman had spent that entire month trying to talk Montgomery Clift into leaving a Broadway play for the part of Damian in The North Star? Luckily for me, Monty was very happy on Broadway, and now the movie was ready to go into production. They had to have someone for the part. My call did come.&nbsp;I was back in the same conference room. The same three people were there along with another man introduced to me as Benno Schneider, an acting teacher from New York. He was the dialogue director for the film. He asked me to sit down with him to read the scene. I pulled out my tattered pages and we began.&nbsp;Something was wrong--our lines didn't fit together. Miss Hellman jumped up waving her cigarette and yelled, "Stop, stop! That's not the new script, goddammit! Get him the right script and let him go look at it." They did, and told me to come back to Mr. Schneider's office in an hour.&nbsp;I took it to a nearby drugstore, ordered an ice cream soda, and studied the new script. It was confusing because I had worked so hard on the other lines, and although some lines were the same, many of the others were a little bit different. When I returned, the guard directed me to Mr. Schneider's office. He was waiting for me. Mr. Schneider was a small middle-aged man with a slight European accent. He was courteous and very soft-spoken. He was also patient and kind.&nbsp;He asked me if I knew anything about the story of The North Star or the character of Damian. I said, "No, nobody told me anything." He filled me in on all of it and asked me just to sit and read the scene with him. The scene was a rewritten version of the one from my first audition, in which I explained to my girl why I had to go and fight with the partisans. After we finished, he said, "Come with me."&nbsp;We went to Bob McIntyre's office and Mr. Schneider said to him, "This is the boy." Mr. McIntyre replied, "Don't tell me, I'm the one who saw him in that play."&nbsp;We went back to the conference room and I read the scene again with Mr. Schneider for Mr. Goldwyn, Mr. Milestone, and Miss Hellman. When we finished, Mr. Goldwyn said, "Do a screen test on this boy as soon as possible."&nbsp;The next day I was walking into a soundstage on the Goldwyn lot when a voice from somewhere yelled out, "Hey, Farley, what the hell are you doing here?" I looked around and spotted Glen Lambert's father up on the seat of a boom microphone. Glen was my best friend and a member of The Daredevils, an adventure club that Glen and I and four of our friends had founded. His father was a sound man in movies. I yelled back, "I'm here to test for a part in the The North Star movie, Mr. Lambert." Just as he burst out with "No shit!," Mr. Milestone walked over to me with a glamorous young woman who was going to do the test with me. Her name was Constance Dowling. She was a contract player at the Goldwyn Studio whose career never took off.&nbsp;The girl I had read with the first time was sweet and pretty, but she didn't look at me much during the scene, which made it hard for me to feel anything about her. When Connie looked at me and spoke, I felt as if I had known her all my life, and what ...</p><h2>Merle Haggard&#39;s My House of Memories : For the Record</h2><p><p> Country music's award-winning and best-selling recording artist, Merle Haggard, brings us his long-awaited new autobiography, <em> Merle Haggard's My House of Memories</em>--a riveting account of Haggard's extremely turbulent and successful life. Picking up where his 1982 autobiography, <em> Sing Me Back Home,</em> left off, Haggard recounts his earliest childhood memories, revealing previously untold stories about his birth and troubled upbringing in a converted railroad boxcar. He recalls the innocence of the 1950s, when a boy could safely ride the rails with hobos and share their transient camps. He talks about his father's death when Merle was nine and how his childish disobedience soon erupted into full-blown delinquency. </p><p> In a thrilling narrative, he takes us on several high speed getaways from the California law and straight inside the state's homes for the criminally delinquent. On his nineteenth birthday, we follow him inside San Quentin and read a chilling account about a cellmate who begs Merle to join him in an escape that ultimately ends with the man's death. Haggard also recalls his befriending of Caryl Chessman, the notorious 1950s serial rapist, and the time they shared before Chessman's execution. </p><p> Having lived a life marked by violence, gambling, and drugs, Merle shares the lessons he learned and how he continues to pay for decades of reckless living. He discloses that after earning more than a hundred million dollars, he's virtually broke. Merle reflects on how he felt at that bittersweet hour seven years ago, as he stood at his wife's bedside during the delivery of their son--and was served bankruptcy papers. And he recalls his family's move into a house so decayed that cattle literally roamed inside. He still lives there, amid improvements, today.</p><p> Haggard relives the painful memory of the death of his mother, who a year earlier, unbeknownst to him, had written her life story in longhand. He reveals his astonishment at learning of her 1906 covered-wagon journey at age four, from Arkansas to Oklahoma, and of how she had to live underground in an earthen dugout. Merle had never known of his mother's life in the Southwest and the fears and hardships she faced.</p> <p> As one of the industry's most respected artists, Merle Haggard still makes music for music's sake and does it with the enthusiasm of an apprentice. He plays several hours a day, every day, on and off the stage and speaks of the emotional salvation the eight notes of the music scale afford him.</p><p> <em> My House of Memories</em> captures the triumph of the human spirit through the power of persistence, through the power of love he finally discovered during his fifth marriage, and through the unsurpassed the joy of reentering fatherhood at age fifty-four. It is an exciting and moving account of the tumultuous life of a songwriter, singer, guitarist, and arranger whose words have earned him international renown as the poet of the common man.</p></p><p>Somewhere in the middle of this blunt autobiography, Merle Haggard talks about the "art called country music" and describes it astutely as "emotion set to rhythm." "A song was an excuse," he writes, "to sing some of the sentimental things." Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that when Haggard attempts the unsung word he's oddly terse, dry, and emotionless--despite his roaring successes and multiple misfortunes. Haggard is nothing if not frank, although his candid storytelling often becomes sensationalistic. For example, his five-year coke orgy during the late '70s and early '80s warrants the opening chapter of an otherwise chronological tale. The death of his father when Haggard was 9 is clearly the defining moment of his life, yet we have to get past his wet T-shirt phase before we hear about it. <p>Haggard spends well more than half the book recounting his early-life travails--revolving-door stays in institutions, halls, reform schools, jails, and prisons of every sort. His misspent-youth stories are enthralling in a certain way, but he seems to tell them from the perspective of either a child who doesn't understand what's happening or an elder who has the benefit of experience--never from the perspective of a man going through these horrors at the time. He even writes on a number of occasions that he looks at his younger self as a completely different person, which may explain why his accounts often lack emotional depth. He recalls (often crudely) his numerous fights, drunken escapades, sexual conquests (stories about wanting to "get into her pants"), and many other sordid details (must we hear the story about his steel player farting during a show?) to the point that what gets short shrift, unfortunately, is his brilliant music. In a way, though, a memoir like this makes perfect sense because Haggard has never pulled any punches. And while the book doesn't offer many of his own insights, it certainly presents a clear picture of his remarkable life, which allows readers to draw their own conclusions about his personality and his music. Perhaps we should be thankful Haggard saves his emotions for his songs--they always make for thrilling listening. <i>--Marc Greilsamer</i></p>Merle Haggard is the author of <em> Sing Me Back Home.</em> He has recorded forty-one number one hits.<p> Tom Carter is a Nashville journalist who has collaborated on autobiographies of major country superstars, including Glen Campbell, Ralph Emery, Reba McEntire, and George Jones.</p></p><h2>Og Mandino&#39;s Great Trilogy with the Geatest Salesman in the World Three Complete and Unabridged Books</h2><p>Here, in one volume, are the three most famous and beloved of Og Mandino&#39;s twenty-two books: The Greatest Salesman in the World: Originally published in 1968, Mandino&#39;s first book combines the power of parable with profound psychological insights.

When the boys&#39; latest prank drives their science teacher over the edge, their clueless principal, Mr. Krupp, quickly hires a replacement: Professor Pippy P. Poopypants. Of course, George and Harold can&#39;t resist making fun of the Professor&#39;s silly name. But then the Professor retaliates by forcing everyone in town to change their own names to be equally silly, with colossal consequences!</p><p>In the fourth "epic novel" by the wildly popular Dav Pilkey, young troublemakers George and Harold are back with Mr. Krupp, the Jerome Horowitz Elementary principal they previously transformed into the superhero Captain Underpants with their 3-D hypno ring. This comic adventure begins in New Swissland, where everyone has a silly name. ("Just ask their president, the Honorable Chuckles Jingleberry McMonkeyburger Jr. or his lovely wife, Stinky.") New Swissland, just southeast of Greenland, is the home of the inventor of the Shrinky-Pig 2000 and the Goosy-Grow 4000--Professor Pippy P. Poopypants. When the professor decides to pitch his inventions in the United States, he is laughed out of every institution of higher learning because of his unusual name. Frustrated, he decides to become an elementary school science teacher where the innocent children will, he assumes, be accepting and loving.<p> This is where his world collides with George and Harold's, who are not accepting of his funny name, but instead explode with laughter and promptly craft a new comic book called "Captain Underpants and the Pied Pooper of Piqua." This hilarious book will crack Pilkey fans up with tiny toilets of truth, evil gerbils, and even Cher's greatest hits. (The children--not notoriously good spellers--note: "All animal cruelty was simulated. No actual girbles were forsed to listen to Cher.") And what becomes of Professor Poopypants? He gets even, devising a method to convert all names into silly names. He creates a chart in which everyone has to use letters from their own first and last names to create a madcap moniker. In the end, George and Harold learn that it's not nice to make fun of people: "'Wow,' said Harold. 'I think this is the first time one of our stories ever had a <i>moral</i>!'

The reggae superstar survives, but leaves Jamaica the following day, not to return for two years. Inspired by this near-mythic event, A Brief History of Seven Killings is an imagined oral biography, told by ghosts, witnesses, killers, members of parliament, drug dealers, common, beauty queens, FBI and CIA agents, reporters, journalists, and even Keith Richards&#39; drug dealer. Marlon James s dazzling novel is a tour de force. It traverses strange landscapes and shady characters, as motivations are examined and questions asked in a masterpiece of imagination.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> This is a book that I did not expect to enjoy. Having finished it&#x2014;and feeling, as I do now, that <i>A Brief History of Seven Killings</i> is one of the best books I&#x2019;ve read all year&#x2014;I went back and identified the reasons why I did not expect to like it. Reason #1&#x2014; <i>The story is an oral history told in multiple voices</i>: that&#x2019;s true, but James&#x2019; enormous talent makes the multiple voices work. Reading the novel is an immersive experience&#x2014;the characters are real, they are engaging, and James uses them to look at all sides of the story. Yes, the multiple points-of-view are difficult at first, but each voice quickly distinguishes itself as unique and important; the payoff is a novel of sweeping scope and emotion. Reason #2&#x2014;<i>Many of the characters speak in Jamaican patois</i>: like many readers, I&#x2019;m not a big fan of dialect on the page. Tell me what they say, not necessarily how they say it. But James pulls it off with remarkable ease. I expected the patois to start to grate once I got further into the book. It never did. The language only added to my understanding of the story and its characters. Reason #3&#x2014;<i>Violence</i>: this is not an easy book, particularly when it comes to violence. It starts early, and there&#x2019;s a lot of it (certainly more than seven killings). But it&#x2019;s there for a reason. By showing the violence, the poverty, and the struggle to survive in 70s Jamaica, James illustrates how the ghetto can change a person. Over time, we see how every man and woman is changed. Reason #4 &#x2013;<i>It&#x2019;s about Jamaica</i>: I hesitate to admit that I wasn&#x2019;t initially interested in a book set in Jamaica. Am I just not interested in a world so different from mine? Whatever the underlying reason, I was wrong to think that way. I could take the easy route and say that this novel is about something more than Jamaica, but that seems obvious. All I can say is: these people were real to me. And like all great novels, James&#x2019; work drew me in, entertained me, and changed me in ways I could not have anticipated. &#x2013;<i>Chris Schluep</i></p>Marlon James is a Jamaican novelist.

These essays shed light on some of the most perplexing and vexing issues of our day: affirmative action, the disparity between civil rights law and reality, the racist outbursts&#x201d; of some black leaders, the temptation toward violent retaliation, and much more.</p><p><b>Derrick Bell,</b> a visiting professor at New York University Law School, was dismissed by Harvard University from his position as Weld Professor of Law for refusing to end his two-year leave through which he protested the absence of minority women on the law faculty. He is also the author of <i>Faces at the Bottom of the Well, Confronting Authority,</i> and <i>And We Are Not Saved.</i>Here, as he did in And We Are Not Saved, Harvard Law School professor Bell offers dramatized accounts of the dilemma of race relations in America. Bell uses stories and fables to examine such themes as desire for homeland; the role of violence; interracial relationships; and scapegoating. He argues that ``racial nepotism'' on the part of whites allows de facto discrimination to exist even without animosity: ``When whites perceive that it will be profitable or at least cost-free to serve, hire, admit, or otherwise deal with blacks on a non-discriminatory basis, they do so. When they fear- -accurately or not--that there may be a loss, inconvenience, or upset to themselves or other whites, discriminatory conduct usually follows.'' Such racism will be with us forever, Bell contends. In the face of this, he calls for blacks to ``fashion a philosophy that both matches the unique dangers we face, and enables us to recognize in those dangers opportunities for committed living and humane service.'' Bell's method of making his points through stories allows for a certain moral complexity: Thoughtful persons work menial jobs; a dynamic black leader who has dedicated his life to his people and worries about his place in history falls in love with a white woman; space aliens who speak English with Reagan's voice arrive with gold, safe nuclear power, and ``special chemicals capable of unpolluting the environment''--and all they ask in exchange is that America's black citizens be turned over to them. But the stories, for all their fablelike power, are laden with great chunks of orotund exposition and numerous overworked adverbs. By using them, Bell forfeits the polemical passion of his introductory essay, while their simplistic dramatizations jar with the impressive legal erudition apparent elsewhere. Still, despite his lackluster writing, Bell offers insight into the rage, frustration, and yearning of being black in America. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

With these paintings as backdrop, Erdrich summons to life the Ojibwe's spirits and songs, their language and sorrows, and the tales that are in their blood, echoing through her own family's very contemporary American lives and shaping her vision of the wider world. Thoughtful, moving, and wonderfully well observed, her meditation evokes ancient wisdom, modern ways, and the universal human concerns we all share. <br><br>"This book is a treasure and a delight."&#x2014;<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><p><p>For more than three decades, bestselling author Louise Erdrich has enthralled readers with dazzling novels that paint an evocative portrait of Native American life.

Her journey links ancient stone paintings with a magical island where a bookish recluse built an extraordinary library, and she reveals how both have transformed her.</p><p>A blend of history, mythology, and memoir, <em>Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country</em> is an enchanting meditation on modern life, natural splendor, and the ancient spirituality and creativity of Erdrich's native homeland&#x2014;a long, elemental tradition of storytelling that is in her blood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Louise Erdrich, daughter of an Ojibwe-French mother and a German-American father, is one of our foremost contemporary writers.

He states that each time he writes, he finds his understanding of life and love just a little clearer and his expression of that understanding a little more vivid. Dekker&#x2019;s body of work includes Heaven&#x2019;s Wager, When Heaven Weeps, Thunder of Heaven, Blessed Child, A Man Called Blessed, Blink, Thr3e, The Circle Series: Black, Red, White, Green (a prequel), and Obsessed.Adam Verner&#39;s powerful characterization of evil Marsuvees Black is chilling. Verner makes believable Black&#39;s efforts to eliminate religious freedom in the United States. When Billy and Darcy&#39;s unexplained supernatural powers manifest, Verner captures their anxiety and fear with an understated portrayal, and then credibly depicts their inexplicable change in attitude. Verner&#39;s energetic performance of the final stand against evil at Paradise amid three thousand people is also gripping. However, Verner&#39;s excellent narration and characterizations can&#39;t make up for the flaws in Dekker&#39;s story, which is the conclusion of the series. Although similar to the books in the Left Behind series, Sinner is pedantic, predictable, and not at all typical of this author.

I believe in ghosts.<br> <br>Maybe that doesn&#x2019;t come across as very dramatic. After all, lots of people believe in ghosts. You always hear stories about some guy who felt a &#x201c;presence&#x201d; or glimpsed a fleeting, unexplainable phenomenon. There are mediums who claim they can make contact with the great beyond and receive messages to let the living know that all is well. Or not. Then there are those people who operate on a more philosophical level ... the spiritual types who believe that the energy of the human soul is so powerful, it must continue on after death to some other plane of existence. Of course, there are millions of people who love getting scared by ghost stories. They may not believe, but they sure have fun pretending.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not like any of those people. At least not anymore. A little over a week ago you could have put me in the category of somebody who didn&#x2019;t necessarily believe in anything supernatural, though I did like horror movies. But that was then. Before last week. A week is like ... nothing. How many particular weeks can anybody really remember? A week can fly by like any other. Or it can change your life. You tend to remember those weeks.<br> <br>I remember last week.<br> <br>It was the week the haunting began.<br> <br>Or maybe I should call it the hunting because that&#x2019;s what it was. I was being hunted. And haunted. It wasn&#x2019;t a good week.<br> <br>My name is Marshall Seaver. People call me Marsh. I live in a small town in Connecticut called Stony Brook. It&#x2019;s a suburb of New York City where moms drive oversize silver trucks to Starbucks and most kids play soccer whether they want to or not. It&#x2019;s the kind of place where kids are trained from birth to compete. In everything. School, sports, friendships, clothes ... you know, everything. I&#x2019;m not sure what the point is other than to win bragging rights. Luckily, my parents didn&#x2019;t buy into that program. They said I should set my own priorities. I liked that. Though it puts pressure on me to figure out what those priorities are.<br> <br>I guess you&#x2019;d call us middle class. We&#x2019;ve only got one car and it&#x2019;s almost as old as I am. I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s still running, because we drove it into the ground. My parents liked to travel. That was one of <i>their</i> priorities. Whenever they had two days off, we&#x2019;d hit the road, headed for some national monument or backwater town that served awesome gumbo or had historical significance or maybe just sounded different. I complained a lot about how boring it was, but to be honest, I didn&#x2019;t hate it. Bumping around in the back of a car wasn&#x2019;t great, but the adventure of it all made it worthwhile. It&#x2019;s kind of cool to see things for real instead of on TV. I miss those trips.<br> <br>Other than that, my life is pretty usual. Unlike a lot of people in this town, I&#x2019;ve never been inside a country club. Most of my clothes come from Target. I ride my bike to school. We don&#x2019;t live in a monster-size house, but it&#x2019;s plenty big enough for the three of us.<br> <br>That is, when there were still three of us.<br> <br>Things have changed. Not that long ago I thought I had a pretty good handle on what normal was. I was wrong. Nothing about my life is normal anymore. The events that unfolded over the last week weren&#x2019;t just about me, either. Many lives were touched and not all for the better. As I look back, I can&#x2019;t help but wonder what might have happened if different decisions had been made. Different paths taken. So many innocent choices added to a butterfly effect that fed the nightmare. Or created it. I guess it goes without saying that I&#x2019;m still alive. Not everyone was so lucky. That&#x2019;s the harsh thing about ghost stories. Somebody has to die. No death, no ghost. I survived the week and that gives me a feeling of guilt I&#x2019;ll carry forever. Or at least for as long as I live. I hope that&#x2019;s a good long time, but there are no guarantees because this story isn&#x2019;t done.<br> <br>The hunt is still on.<br> <br>My story may sound like a fantasy, and maybe some of it is. But many things happened over that week that can&#x2019;t be ignored or explained away as having sprung from an overly imaginative mind. People died. Lives were changed. That was no dream. After what I saw and experienced, there&#x2019;s one other bit of reality I have to accept.<br> <br>I believe in ghosts.<br> <br>After you hear my story, I think you will too.<br> <br>� 2010 D. J. MACHALE|<b><b>1</b></b><br> <br>Cooper Foley was in trouble. Again.<br> <br>&#x201c;What were you thinking?&#x201d; I screamed at him. &#x201c;Counterfeit tickets? Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy, Ralph,&#x201d; Coop replied calmly. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know they were bogus.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cooper always called me Ralph.<br> <br>&#x201c;Even so,&#x201d; I argued. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s illegal to scalp <i>real</i> tickets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; he corrected. &#x201c;Not if you sell them at face value.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you sell them at face value?&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wanted to smack him.<br> <br>Cooper and I were making the long walk to school on the last day of the year before summer vacation. He was my best friend. Okay, my only friend. My only <i>good</i> friend, anyway. I think the main reason we got along so well was because we were completely different. I worry. Cooper doesn&#x2019;t. I think things through. Cooper doesn&#x2019;t. I freeze in social situations. Cooper doesn&#x2019;t. I hate playing sports. Cooper doesn&#x2019;t. I worry about what people think of me. Cooper doesn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>I think we stayed friends because there was never any competition between us. We had plenty of fights over the years, but they always ended up in a wrestling match that lasted about eight seconds. No punches were ever thrown in anger. As we walked along on that hot June day, I was ready to plot out all the exciting adventures we&#x2019;d be sharing that summer. Instead I found out that Cooper was in trouble. Again.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Cooper shrugged as if he didn&#x2019;t really care. &#x201c;Nothing. I got spanked, that&#x2019;s all. Nobody thinks I printed out a bunch of phony Yankees tickets. And for the record, I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then who did?&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave me a sly smile. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell you that, Ralph. I&#x2019;d have to kill you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Coop was changing ... and not for the better. Though he was always a wild guy, he never got into serious trouble. With him it was about being a goof in class or skateboarding without a helmet. The thing was, he always made the teachers laugh and didn&#x2019;t need a helmet because he never crashed. Ever. Once when we were around ten, we snuck into the private stable of some uber-rich Wall Street guy. I was so scared, I wanted to puke. In fact, I did. All over my pants. Not Coop. He hopped on the back of a prize thoroughbred and rode it, bareback, out of the stable and across the huge lawn, shouting, &#x201c;Yippiekiyay!&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t get in trouble, either. I, on the other hand, caught hell for ruining my pants. Cooper lived a charmed life. He never puked on his pants.<br> <br>That is, until we got to high school. That&#x2019;s when he started pushing things. He got into fights. Real fights. He&#x2019;d skip school. His parents started coming down on him for his grades, which made it pretty tense around the Foley house. They grounded him ... he snuck out. We&#x2019;d go for weeks without seeing each other because he started hanging around with some older guys. They smelled like bad news, so I didn&#x2019;t go anywhere near them. I&#x2019;d bet anything they had something to do with the counterfeit tickets Coop was busted for selling.<br> <br>None of this was like Coop. At least not the Coop I knew. Yeah, he liked to have fun and push some limits, but he wasn&#x2019;t a bad guy. Or maybe I was just naive.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Ralph,&#x201d; he assured me. &#x201c;It was dumb. I get it. I&#x2019;m not going there again.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d heard that promise before.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Tomorrow the gun goes off on summer. What&#x2019;s the plan? I know you&#x2019;ve got a plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mood changed instantly. Coop had that ability. When he got psyched up about something, he brought everyone else right along with him. He was right. I had a plan. I&#x2019;d been looking forward to this summer for months.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be great,&#x201d; I said with excitement. &#x201c;The rocket kits finally came in. We can set up shop and build &#x2019;em at my house ... wait&#x2019;ll you see the new plasma Dad got from work ... hello, Yankees in high def ... then we can head up to the reservoir and camp for a couple of days and launch &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cooper gave me a blank stare. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said with absolutely no enthusiasm.<br> <br>Undaunted, I pressed on. &#x201c;Oh! And the Jansens said I could take their Hobie Cat out whenever I wanted. I&#x2019;m thinking we can race the ferry out to Captain&#x2019;s Island like we did last summer. Remember that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cooper barely reacted. No, I take that back. Each time I mentioned something I thought was cool, he winced like I was nailing him with poison darts.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked, confused. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t that sound great?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uhh ... yeah,&#x201d; he muttered awkwardly. &#x201c;But I was kinda thinking more like we should hang out at the beach.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do that, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A lot?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure, if you want. But there&#x2019;s so much more we can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Coop gave me a sly smile. &#x201c;Not that involves girls in bikinis.&#x201d;<br> <br>Couldn&#x2019;t argue with that.<br> <br>He added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking the beach at the Point will be our base of operations. Or maybe our <i>entire</i> operation. Why not? We&#x2019;ve only got a couple of months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But ... really? That&#x2019;s all you want to do? Hang out at the beach?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No! I&#x2019;m all for the rocket thing,&#x201d; he exclaimed. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get that on the schedule for, oh ... sometime in late August.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re killing me,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I was disappointed in Coop. He hated being bored and so did I. He was always looking for different things to do and coming up with new adventures that kept us moving. That was his job. Trolling for girls at the beach was okay by me, but I didn&#x2019;t want it to be our sole focus. Besides, the girls I liked had more interesting things to do than spend every waking moment sitting around at the beach comparing tans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, c&#x2019;mon, Ralph!&#x201d; Coop said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s better than sitting on a blanket in the warm sand next to three or four or eight girls wearing little more than underwear?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And talking about ... what? Reality TV? Perez Hilton?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, now <i>you&#x2019;re</i> killing <i>me</i> !&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Who <i>cares</i> what we talk about?&#x201d;<br> <br>I guess I did. Unfortunately. Truth was, I needed help in the girl department. Whenever I was around somebody I liked, I got self-conscious. I&#x2019;m not sure why, either. I think I&#x2019;m okay-looking and wasn&#x2019;t hit too hard by the acne stick. I&#x2019;ve got blond hair and brown eyes, which I&#x2019;ve heard more than once is a pretty good combination. I think part of my trouble is that I get nervous and start talking too much about things I&#x2019;m interested in, and most girls don&#x2019;t care about graphic novels or wartime history. At least not the ones I&#x2019;ve met. Coop may have had high hopes for a stellar summer at the beach, but I couldn&#x2019;t see myself starting up a casual conversation about the Battle of Bull Run with a bunch of near-naked girls. They&#x2019;d crucify me.<br> <br>Besides, I liked building rockets.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Ralph!&#x201d; Cooper said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with messing around a little? That&#x2019;s what summer&#x2019;s for. It&#x2019;s in the rule book.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with it,&#x201d; I shot back. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s other stuff too. You always liked doing stupid stuff like building rockets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I liked Power Rangers too ... when I was six.&#x201d; He put his arm around my shoulder and said, &#x201c;We are looking at what could be the most awesome summer of our lives, and all we have to do is ... uh-oh.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spotted something over my shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trouble Town,&#x201d; he whispered.<br> <br>The courtyard in front of school was packed, but the crowd parted magically to reveal a stunning girl walking toward us. She had long, shiny black hair that fell to her shoulders and dark skin that was the product of an early season tan. Judging from her short shorts, she didn&#x2019;t mind showing off her long legs. She was hot, and she knew it. Her dark eyes were focused on Coop. My mouth went dry. Something was about to happen. She walked right up to us, locked eyes with Cooper, and snarled a simple, succinct, and venomous &#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; then blew past us without breaking stride.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you too, Agnes,&#x201d; Coop called to her.<br> <br>Whenever Cooper gave a girl a hard time, he called her Agnes. With guys it was Richard. In this case the Agnes was Sydney Foley. Cooper&#x2019;s older sister. She and Coop didn&#x2019;t like each other much, which was too bad because I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded hanging out with her. I didn&#x2019;t have the same trouble making conversation with her like I did with other girls. That&#x2019;s because when I was with her, I couldn&#x2019;t speak at all. Seriously. My tongue would swell up and my throat would close. I guess you would call her intimidating. She and Coop had the same dark hair and blue eyes, but that&#x2019;s where the similarity ended. The girl was cold. I mean icy. She was a year ahead of us in school and light-years ahead academically. I think she&#x2019;ll have a shot at class valedictorian. She always had a boyfriend but never anyone for long. I guess she got bored easily. Sydney Foley was definitely out of my league ... if I were to be in a league. Still, I would have welcomed the chance to hang out with her a little, and if it just so happened to be on one of those days that Coop made me go to the beach and she just so happened to be there in a bikini, maybe I&#x2019;d have to think twice about being so critical of Coop&#x2019;s summer plans.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess she found out about the scalping thing,&#x201d; I said weakly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Dinner tonight&#x2019;s gonna be a real party,&#x201d; he lamented. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get lectured by my parents about straightening up and being responsible while she stares through me with those undead vampire eyes. Yeesh.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t think Sydney&#x2019;s eyes looked undead at all, but I could see where getting stared at would be unnerving. But that&#x2019;s just a guess. Sydney barely knew I existed.<br> <br>Coop shrugged it off and broke out a big, winning smile. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s cool. Tonight I pay the price and tomorrow ... summer!&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave me a double okay sign. That was his way of saying not to worry and that it&#x2019;s all good.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;I say we load up on frozen pizzas, head to your house, and build us some rockets.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had to smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a piece of work, you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave me a friendly shove and said, &#x201c;Absolutely. It&#x2019;s all part of the Foley mystique.&#x201d;<br> <br>Coop had done it again ... he made things right. As we strode into school, I had new hope that the vacation might turn out to be decent after all, especially if I got the old Coop back.<br> <br>The last day of school was pretty much a blow-off. You&#x2019;re supposed to go to classes, but exams are over and teachers don&#x2019;t care what you do. Most everybody hangs out and gets their yearbooks signed with &#x201c;See you this summer!&#x201d;&#x2014;which seems like a lame thing to write, but who am I to judge? I didn&#x2019;t buy a yearbook, so I headed right for the art department. That&#x2019;s where I hung out when I wasn&#x2019;t in class. The art rooms were a refuge for those who didn&#x2019;t fit into a particular clique ... which I guess meant we were our own clique.

A first novel. 350,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Kathleen McGowan</b> is an internationally published writer whose work has appeared on five continents and in at least fifteen languages. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and three sons. You can visit her website at www.theexpectedone.com.This title shares a similarity of subject matter with THE DA VINCI CODE--the possibility of a Gospel written by Christ's wife and apostle, Mary Magdalene. But THE EXPECTED ONE takes a different approach. As read by Linda Emond, this story of a Magdalene descendant, writer Maureen Paschal, is certainly a spiritual quest. But it deals with the inner lives of the characters rather than focusing on a physical search for evidence. Emond's approach is low-key; her command of accents (American, French, Scots, Italian, and Irish) is never permitted to upstage the characters. The author's claim to be a Magdalene descendant and her afterword add further interest.

Tour.</p><p>Alfie Kohn&#39;s six previous books include Punished by Rewards and No Contest: The Case Against Competition, as well as Beyond Displine and What to Look for in a Classroom. Descrilbed by Time magazine last year as &#34;perhaps the country&#39;s most outspoken critic of educational fixation on grades and test scores,&#34; he is a popular lecturer, speaker to teachers, parents, and reasearchers accross the country. The author currently resides in Belmont, Massachusetts.A compelling argument that the use of rewards is counterproductive in raising children, teaching students, and managing workers. Kohn (The Brighter Side of Human Nature, 1990, etc.) contends that rewards, like punishments, are methods of controlling people--perhaps a morally objectionable goal--and that, at best, they produce only temporary compliance. He begins by tracing the development of behaviorist doctrine and the widespread acceptance of its popular version, encapsulated in the idea ``do this and you'll get that.'' Kohn examines the effect that rewards have on behavior, concluding that rewards fail for many reasons: They punish; rupture relationships; ignore underlying reasons for behavior; discourage risk-taking; and undermine interest in the task at hand. The author looks carefully at three places in which rewards are used extensively- -the workplace, the classroom, and the home--and demonstrates in turn why incentive plans and other reward-based systems employed, first, by managers fail to improve the quality of work; why outward motivations undermine students' intrinsic motivation to learn; and why children whose parents use rewards to motivate them are less likely to develop a sense of responsibility and the ability to make ethical judgments. Having shown that rewards don't work, Kohn undertakes the more difficult task of developing a strategy that does. His solution is based on what he calls the ``three C's''--``content,'' ``choice,'' and ``collaboration''-- and he illustrates how they can be applied by managers, teachers, and parents. Three appendices round out his well-documented study: excerpts from a 1983 interview with a rather crotchety B.F. Skinner; a reflective essay on intrinsic motivation; and Kohn's prediction of how behaviorists will respond to his arguments. A clear, convincing demonstration of the shortcomings of pop-behaviorism, written with style, humor, and authority. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrate how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life -- one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus&#39; character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement found. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus&#39; life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: &#34;For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus -- the living one who comes to us even now -- will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time</p><p>All Christianity is, to some extent, idolatrous. Christian worship is a response to a worshiper's image of Jesus, and all images of Jesus fall short of his reality--in the same way that all biographies and portraits fail to depict a whole person. In <i>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</i>, New Testament scholar Marcus Borg attempts to understand how popular images of Jesus connect Christians to their savior and isolate them from him. Borg writes about his own evolving ideas of who Jesus was, considers the scholarly and popular religious evolution of Jesus' public image, and investigates with special care the effects of Historical Jesus research on contemporary images of Jesus. <i>Meeting Jesus Again</i> is written in an affable, gracious, and unflinchingly honest voice. Borg's description of his own faith particularly exemplifies these qualities, and gives the reader a simultaneously safe and unsettling new perspective on the peasant from Galilee: "[T]he central issue of the Christian life is not believing in God or believing in the Bible," he writes. "Rather, the Christian life is about entering into a relationship with that to which the Christian tradition points, which may be spoken of as God, the risen, living Christ, or the Spirit. And a Christian is one who lives out his or her relationship to God within the framework of the Christian tradition." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"It is impossible to read this beautifully written book and remain unenlightened by the results of Jesus research, or untouched by the power of Jesus' way." (Elizabeth A. Johnson, author of <i>She Who Is</i>) <p>Of the many recent books on the historical Jesus, none has explored what the latest biblical scholarship means for personal faith. Now, in <i>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,</i> Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, on that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. </p><p>"Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him," Borg writes," Rather, it means to give one's heart, one's self at its deepest level, to...the living Lord." </p><p>Drawing on his own journey from a nave, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life--one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. </p><p>In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus' character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder.

On one hand, there's a culture of hero worship around celebrity chefs that fuels cooking-as-a-spectator-sport on television. At the same time, marketers worked for decades to convince people that cooking themselves isn't worth their time, and that even simple dishes fall outside their grasp. All this explains why one woman in the book told me, 'I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've eaten Tuna Helper while watching Gordon Ramsey.'&nbsp;It's a funny line about a serious problem. The rise of convenience food and decline of home cooking are inextricably correlated to the surge of obesity and diabetes. If people think they can't cook, they put themselves at the mercy of companies whose interests are primarily financial to feed them instead.&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe in the power of home cooking and one of my life's mission is to help people find their way off the couch and into the kitchen.After attending the famed Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, writer Kathleen Flinn returned home unsure of what to do with her culinary degree -- until the day she stumbled upon a stranger in a local supermarket. When she saw the woman's cart stacked with boxes of ultraprocessed products, Flinn's "chefternal" instinct took over. As she convinced the woman to replace the packages with fresh, real food, Flinn started to wonder whether she had found a new calling.<br>Inspired by this chance encounter, Flinn gathered a group of volunteers who felt intimated by cooking. Flinn investigated items inside their pantries, catalogued the contents of their fridges and freezers, inquired what they bought and threw away, and sampled what they routinely prepared. She enlisted the aid of a feast of culinary professionals including a Top Chef contestant, a Seattle graduate to offer classes on fundamentals from chopping and braising to preparing vinaigrette and conducting comparative tastings of everyday staples such as salt and canned tomatoes. In each class, she explored simple, smart strategies for supermarket savings while teaching her recruits how to choose and cook food that's delicious, healthier and better for the planet.<br><br>The students varied in age and circumstances, from a twenty-two-year-old living in the fast food lane, a pair of thirty-something women with young children and singles in their forties -- all a mix of suburban, urban and rural dwellers from the affluent to food-stamp users.<br>Yet all of them found a common missing ingredients in their lives: confidence in the kitchen and confidence in themselves. Even the oldest volunteer noted that at age sixty-one, "Something changed in me... It is remarkable that I can still learn something, that I can still surprise myself."&nbsp;<br><br>In this transformational follow-up to her bestselling culinary memoir, <i>The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry</i>, Flinn teaches everything from knife skills to limiting food waste. Told in Flinn's touching, funny and engaging voice, <i>The Kitchen Counter Cooking School</i> delivers an entertaining, valuable experience for culinary novices and seasoned cooks alike.</p><h2>Pitch Perfect: How to Say It Right the First Time, Every Time (How to Say It Right the First Time, Every Time Hardcover)</h2><p><p>Media guru and Emmy Award-winning correspondent Bill McGowan&#x2014;coach to some of the biggest names in business and entertainment, including Eli Manning, Kelly Clarkson, Jack Welch, Thomas Keller and Kenneth Cole teaches you how to get your message across and get what you want with pitch perfect communication.&nbsp; He is also a trusted advisor in the C-suites of tech companies like, Facebook, Spotify, AirBnB, Dropbox and Salesforce.com.</p><p>Saying the right thing the right way can make the difference between sealing the deal or losing the account, getting a promotion, or getting a pink slip.

A remarkably handsome young boy, still a teenager, gets "discovered by a big-time movie agent. Because when he takes his shirt off young hearts beat faster, because he is the picture of innocence and trust and need, he will become a star. It seems almost preordained. The open smile says, "You will love me," and soon the whole world does. <br><br> The young boy's name was Tab Hunter&#x2014;a made-up name, of course, a Hollywood name&#x2014;and it was his time. Stardom didn't come overnight, although it seemed that way. In fact, the fame came first, when his face adorned hundreds of magazine covers; the movies, the studio contract, the name in lights&#x2014;all that came later. For Tab Hunter was a true product of Hollywood, a movie star created from a stable boy, a shy kid made even more so by the way his schoolmates&#x2014;both girls and boys&#x2014;reacted to his beauty, by a mother who provided for him in every way except emotionally, and by a secret that both tormented him and propelled him forward. <br><br> In <i>Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star</i>, Hunter speaks out for the first time about what it was like to be a movie star at the end of the big studio era, to be treated like a commodity, to be told what to do, how to behave, whom to be seen with, what to wear. He speaks also about what it was like to be gay, at first confused by his own fears and misgivings, then as an actor trapped by an image of boy-next-door innocence. And when he dared to be difficult, to complain to the studio about the string of mostly mediocre movies that were assigned to him, he learned that just like any manufactured product, he was disposable&#x2014;<i>disposable and replaceable</i>. <br><br> Hunter's career as a bona fide movie star lasted a decade. But he persevered as an actor, working continuously at a profession he had come to love, seeking&#x2014;and earning&#x2014;the respect of his peers, and of the Hollywood community.<br><br> And so, <i>Tab Hunter Confidential</i> is at heart a story of survival&#x2014;of the giddy highs of stardom, and the soul-destroying lows when phone calls begin to go unreturned; of the need to be loved, and the fear of being consumed; of the hope of an innocent boy, and the rueful summation of a man who did it all, and who lived to tell it all.</p><p>With very little hedging, great good humor, and no pretentiousness, <i>Tab Hunter Confidential</i> delivers the straight story on how a young, gorgeous kid named Art Gelien, child of an absent father and a repressed, platitude-spouting mother, suddenly became a teen hearthrob, known as "The Sigh Guy." Tab Hunter was, in the 1950s, one of the reigning hunks, every teenage girl's dreamboat. He dated Debbie Reynolds and other starlets, did countless interviews about the kind of girl he would marry and, through it all, kept his private life <i>very</i> private. Tab Hunter was gay before gay meant anything other than joyful exuberance. <p> Henry Willson, famous and infamous agent and creator of stars, named Tab Hunter. He also tagged Rock Hudson, Rory Calhoun, and other young sex symbols. Not all of them were gay, but they came to be known as Harry Willson's boys. (Another book about this time and subject is <i>The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson</i> by Robert Hofler.) Tab Hunter was completely manufactured. He even speaks of himself in the third person in the book. </p><p> Before he was 26, Hunter had hit the trifecta: he was a movie star, had a hit single in "Young Love," and was on the first live production of <i>Playhouse 90</i> on television. His future success looked assured, but such was not the case. It was either feast of famine for the next few years. He was never a solid A-list leading man, but had his share of famous co-stars and leading ladies nevertheless. </p><p> While he was struggling with his true identity and trying to stay afloat financially, his mother had a complete breakdown and he was forced to hospitalize her in less than ideal conditions. This also had to be a secret from the fans. His friendships, both intimate and platonic, kept him going, as well as his deep faith in Catholicism. Yes, Catholicism. Tab Hunter has his own unique pact with God. </p><p> The book is filled with many pictures of Tab and his friends and with anecdotes about the stars: Tallulah Bankhead on her last legs, fuzzy and outrageous; Linda Darnell's kindness; John Wayne's macho strutting; Fred Astaire's humility; Van Heflin's professionalism, and on and on. This is sheer heaven for any movie fan. His relationship with Tony Perkins is noted, as is his liaison with Olympic figure skater Ronnie Robertson. (Tab, in addition to being an actor, singer and horseman was also an accomplished figure skater.) When the good parts disappeared after he left Warner Brothers, he went on tour with the Everly Brothers. Much later, now fully "out" he joined Divine in two John Waters movies: <i>Polyester</i> and <i>Lust in the Dust</i>, both cult classics. After suffering a stroke and a heart attack, he is now enjoying life in Santa Barbara with his longtime companion, Allan Glaser. As Tab succinctly puts it regarding his story: "Better to get it from the horse's mouth, I decided, and not from some horse's ass." <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>He became an instant star and a #1 box office attraction, recorded a #1 hit song, and survived a major sex scandal&#x2014;all by the time he was twenty-five. Five years later, new stars had been developed to meet the demands of fickle fans, and Tab Hunter found himself scrambling to find work, struggling just to survive. Yet survive he did, re-creating himself as a cult star and film producer in a career that spans five decades and more than fifty films, from <em>Island of Desire</em> to <em>Lust in the Dust</em>. <br> <br> But first, he was Art Gelien, an introverted and extremely attractive young boy who was discovered by a Hollywood agent and transformed&#x2014;with the help of studio publicity hacks&#x2014;into Tab Hunter, Movie Star. This book tells how it all happened, and what it felt like to be created, packaged, and sold to the American public. How it felt to appear on-screen, off-screen, and on every newsstand in America with the biggest leading ladies of the day&#x2014;Linda Darnell, Natalie Wood, Debbie Reynolds, Lana Turner, and Rita Hayworth&#x2014;while dealing with the reality of being gay in a time when the word didn&#x2019;t exist. It&#x2019;s his story of how he kept his bearings when he was suddenly no longer the boy-next-door heartthrob, no longer under the protective wing of the Warner Bros. publicity department, no longer in demand as a &#x201c;star.&#x201d; It is his story of how he soldiered on&#x2014;with perseverance, determination, and faith.

Robert Service has written a calmly authoritative biography on this seemingly unknowable figure. Making use of recently opened archives, he has been able to piece together the private as well as the public life, giving the first complete picture of Lenin. This biography simultaneously provides an account of one of the greatest turning points in modern history. Through the prism of Lenin&#39;s career, Service examines events such as the October Revolution and the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, the one-party state, economic modernization, dictatorship, and the politics of inter-war Europe. In discovering the origins of the USSR, he casts light on the nature of the state and society which Lenin left behind and which have not entirely disappeared after the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991.</p><p>LENIN: His politics still reverberate around the world even after the end of the USSR. His name elicits revulsion and reverence. And yet Lenin the man remains largely a mystery. This biography shows us Lenin as we have never seen him, in his full complexity as revolutionary, political leader, thinker, and private person.<p>Born Vladimir Illich Ulyanov in 1870, the son of a schools inspector and a doctor's daughter, Lenin was to become the greatest single force in the Soviet revolution -- and perhaps the most influential politician of the twentieth century. Drawing on sources only recently discovered, Robert Service explores the social, cultural, and political catalysts for Lenin's explosion into global prominence. His book gives us the vast panorama of Russia in that awesome vortex of change from tsarism's collapse to the establishment of the communist one-party state. Through the prism of Lenin's career Service focuses on dictatorship, the Marxist revolutionary dream, civil war, and inter-war European politics. And we are shown how Lenin, despite the hardships he inflicted, was widely mourned after his death in 1924.</p><p>Robert Service's Lenin is a political colossus but also a believable human being. This biography stresses the importance of his supportive family and of its ethnic and cultural background. Service examines his education, upbringing, and the troubles of his early life to explain the emergence of a rebel whose devotion to destruction proved greater than his love for the 'proletariat' he supposedly served. We are enabled to see how his intellectual preoccupations and inner rage underwent volatile interaction and propelled his career from young Marxist activist to founder ofthe communist party and the Soviet state -- and how he bequeathed to Russia a legacy of political oppression and social intimidation that has yet to be expunged.</p>Robert Service is a Fellow of the British Academy and of St Antony&#39;s College, Oxford. He has written several books, including the highly acclaimed Lenin: A Biography, Russia: Experiment with a People, Stalin: A Biography and Comrades: A History of World Communism, as well as many other books on Russia&#39;s past and present. Married with four children, he lives in London.</p><h2>Waking Up in Charleston (The Charleston Trilogy, 3)</h2><p><br><br>The moment Amanda defied her rich and powerful father to marry Bobby O'Leary, Big Max disowned her. Even now, with Bobby dead and Amanda mired in debt, he refuses to forgive her.<br><br>But Caleb, the new man in Amanda's life, is determined to mend fences between father and daughter. He also has a far more personal mission&#x2014;to make Amanda and her family his own. But when she learns how close he is to Big Max and the secret Caleb's been hiding, there's every chance she could walk away.<br><br>As a pastor, Caleb's used to calling on a higher power for help, and heaven knows it's going to take a miracle to fix this before it's too late.<br><br></p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Sunday services were over and most of the congregation had gone home for the traditional midday dinner. Caleb, however, was still in the church office trying to feel his way through an unexpected and troubling counseling session. He studied the couple sitting across from him and wondered if he dared tell them what he really thought, that they were way too young even to be thinking about marriage. Mary Louise Carter was just a few months out of high school. In fact, with her stylishly short, sun-streaked hair, she looked even younger. Danny Marshall, every bit the preppy overachiever, was barely into his sophomore year at Clem son. In Caleb's opinion, they were years away from knowing what they really wanted out of life.<br><br>Unfortunately, he could predict exactly how they'd reply. They'd remind him that they'd known each other since grade school, been sweethearts since Danny's freshman year in high school. They both thought their marriage was inevitable. So what if having a baby on the way had kicked up the timetable by several years?<br><br>"It's not the end of the world," Mary Louise said, her adoring gaze on Danny.<br><br>Though she rarely looked away from her fiance, she evidently didn't see the barely concealed panic that Caleb spotted. He'd counseled enough couples during his ten years as a minister to recognize the signs of a man being pushed toward a commitment he wasn't ready to make.<br><br>"Danny, is this wedding really what you want?" Caleb asked directly. Aware that Mary Louise's eyes had widened with dismay, he quickly added, "I know you love Mary Louise and I think it's wonderful that you want to take responsibility for the baby and do the right thing by Mary Louise, but there are other options."<br><br>Danny squirmed uncomfortably and avoided Mary Louise's hurt expression. "What kind of options?"<br><br>"You could acknowledge paternity and pay child support. Or you both could agree to give the baby up for adoption to a family more prepared to give a child the life he or she deserves," Caleb suggested, careful to keep his tone neutral.<br><br>Even so, Mary Louise leapt up. "No way," she said, quivering with outrage. She scowled at Caleb, then whirled on Danny. "This is our baby. How could you even think about giving away our baby, Danny Marshall?"<br><br>Danny gave her a sullen look. "I didn't say I'd do it. I asked Reverend Webb what the options are. Jeez, Mary Louise, settle down."<br><br>"I'm keeping the baby and that's that," she said fiercely. "If you don't want to marry me, then don't. I don't want you if you can't love both of us. And you can keep your stupid money, too!"<br><br>"I never said I didn't want to marry you," Danny said placatingly. "You know I love you, baby. It's just..."<br><br>"Just what?" she asked.<br><br>"How are we going to make it?" Danny asked reasonably. "I can't quit school. I worked too hard to get accepted and win a scholarship to throw it all away now. I don't want to wind up in some deadend job for the rest of my life, like my dad."<br><br>"You won't have to. I can stay with my folks for now and keep working. It's only minimum wage, but I'll get another job. I can handle two," Mary Louise promised staunchly. "We can put all that money into savings so we'll have it when I have to go on maternity leave. I won't have to take off long. Once the baby comes, I'll move to be with you. We can figure out a schedule so you can take classes when I'm home. Then you can watch the baby while I work."<br><br>It was evident she'd already given this a lot of thought. Caleb admired her earnest conviction that she could handle a pregnancy and two jobs and that Danny could keep up with his classes and take care of the baby. But Caleb was more realistic. He knew the toll that would eventually take on the marriage and on Mary Louise and Danny individually. He also knew she'd never listen to him if he tried to tell her any of that.<br><br>However, he did know someone who might be able to get through to her in a way he couldn't.<br><br>"Okay, you two, I think that's enough for today," Caleb said. The pair needed a cooling-down period.<br><br>"I'm sure this has caught both of you by surprise. You need to spend some time thinking about what you really want and what will be best for the baby. Danny, can you get home from college again next weekend, so we can talk some more?"<br><br>"I guess," Danny said, his reluctance plain, but the stoic lift of his chin told Caleb he would do it. He'd always been a good kid, one who took his responsibilities seriously. He'd worked hard to get a college scholarship, even harder to earn money to help with bills for meals and books.<br><br>"Great, then we'll talk again next week right after church," Caleb told them. "In the meantime, Mary Louise, there's someone I'd like you to meet."<br><br>She regarded him with evident suspicion, clearly not happy about the monkey wrench he'd thrown into her plans for a hasty wedding. "Who?"<br><br>"Let me speak to her first and get back to you," he said.<br><br>"I don't know why you're so opposed to this wedding," Mary Louise said to him plaintively. "You've known us forever. You know we're in love."<br><br>"I do," Caleb agreed. "But I want your marriage to have the best possible chance to succeed, and the way to accomplish that is to make sure you've given this serious consideration from every angle before you rush into something. I've seen too many young people who start out crazy about each other wind up bitter and divorced because they did the right thing and then resented each other afterward. I really don't want that to happen to you."<br><br>Danny gave him a grateful look. "Thanks, Reverend Webb. I'll see you after church next week. Mary Louise, you ready to go?"<br><br>For a moment, based on her pouty expression, Caleb thought she might insist on having this out right here and now, but apparently she caught something in Danny's steady, unrelenting gaze that told her to wait till next time.<br><br>"Remember, I want both of you to do some soul-searching this week. See if there are some other solutions that might make sense. If marriage is what you both want, then think about the best way to make sure you have plenty of support," Caleb suggested. "And I'll be in touch with you, Mary Louise, probably tomorrow."<br><br>"Okay," she said, and followed Danny from the room.<br><br>Just outside the door, Caleb saw Danny reach for her hand and whisper something in her ear that put a smile back on her face. Caleb sighed and reached for his phone to follow up on his brainstorm.<br><br>Okay, he'd been looking for an excuse to call Amanda all day. Ever since he and the other church volunteers had finished building her house two weeks ago and had held a housewarming party just yesterday, he'd been suffering some weird withdrawal symptoms.<br><br>He'd fought his feelings for Amanda O'Leary, struggled to pretend that she was just another member of his congregation in need of help, but the time he'd spent with her and her kids had fulfilled him in unexpected ways. He'd come to admire her strength, to enjoy her sense of humor.<br><br>Before he actually dialed her number, he gave himself a stern lecture on remembering that he was her pastor, not a would-be lover, much as he might wish otherwise. It wasn't the first time he'd struggled to place duty above his needs as a man, but it was the first time he was right on the edge of losing the battle.<br><br>But the lecture didn't seem to stop the jolt to his heart when she answered the phone, her voice soft and a little breathless.<br><br>"Amanda, you weren't taking a nap, were you?"<br><br>"In the middle of the afternoon with three kids loose in the house?" she replied, laughter threading through her voice. "You must be kidding. No, if I sound out of breath, it's because Susie, Larry and Jimmy insisted I play tag with them in the backyard. They can't get over having so much room to run around in. I can't get over it myself. Thank you again, Caleb."<br><br>"Would you stop thanking me?" he pleaded. "Getting that house built for you was something the whole congregation wanted to do." Well, except for a couple of obstinate holdouts, and eventually even they had come around.<br><br>"I just want you to know how much I appreciate it," she said. "If there's ever anything I can do to pay you back, let me know."<br><br>It was exactly the opening Caleb needed. "Actually, there is something you could do." He explained about Mary Louise and Danny. "I think Mary Louise needs to understand the realities of trying to work two jobs and care for a baby. Would you consider talking to her?"<br><br>"Of course I will," Amanda said at once. "But maybe I should clarify something. Are you asking me to help you talk her out of getting married?"<br><br>He considered the question, then answered honestly.<br><br>"I just want her to know what's ahead. Right now she's all caught up in this romantic notion of living with Danny and having his baby and being happy forever. She needs to know how exhausting it can be and what a toll it might take on their marriage. These two kids have been in love practically as long as I've known them. I don't want them to lose that because this pregnancy has backed them into a corner."<br><br>"Will their parents help them?" she asked, an unmistakably wistful note in her voice.<br><br>Caleb knew what it would have meant to Amanda if her father, Big Max, had stepped up when her life fell apart, but the divide between them had been too great. Amanda had made a tentative overture, but as usual Big Max had blown the opportunity. Sometimes Caleb wanted to shake the stubborn old man, but instead, he'd settled for trying to gently nudge them back together. So far, he'd made precious little progress. And if Amanda ever found out what he'd been up to, she might very well hate him for his interference.<br><br>"Actually, even though I haven't spoken to them yet," he said, "I think their parents would help as much as they can. They're all good, decent people who want what's best for their kids. Even so, it's still going to be tough. Danny would probably have to give up his scholarship, quit college and come home."<br><br>"He could go to college here," Amanda reminded him. "It might take him longer, but he could do it."<br><br>"I suppose," he conceded, though he knew how much going to Clemson had meant to Danny. Caleb had made quite a few calls himself to assure Danny's acceptance there. He'd even spoken to the scholarship committee on Danny's behalf.<br><br>"And both sets of grandparents could help out with babysitting if they're here," Amanda continued. "Maybe Mary Louise and Danny could even live with his folks or hers for a while. It wouldn't be ideal, but it might work. Have any of you considered that?"<br><br>"What are you saying?" Caleb asked, startled by the turn the conversation had taken. "Do you think I'm wrong for urging caution?"<br><br>"No, I think you're being a responsible, compassionate minister who's trying to make sure two kids get off to a good start, but sometimes things happen even when the timing sucks. Not every marriage is ideal at the beginning, but if the love is strong, a couple can weather almost anything."<br><br>"The way you and Bobby did," Caleb concluded.<br><br>"The way I <em>thought</em> we had," Amanda corrected. "I lived the illusion right up until the day he died. Then reality set in."<br><br>"I'm sorry."<br><br>"Hey, I'll make you a deal," she said, a teasing note in her voice. "I'll stop saying thank you if you'll stop saying you're sorry."<br><br>Caleb chuckled. "I can do that."<br><br>"So, knowing where I'm coming from, do you still want me to speak to Mary Louise?"<br><br>"Absolutely," he said at once.

Worried that she was losing her passion for the scientific research she once loved, she was compelled to experience wildness again, to be guided by the sounds of birds and to follow the trails of animals.<br> <br>In March of 2012 she and her husband set off on a 4,000-mile wilderness journey from the Pacific rainforest to the Alaskan Arctic, traveling by rowboat, ski, foot, raft, and canoe. Together, they survived harrowing dangers while also experiencing incredible moments of joy and grace -- migrating birds silhouetted against the moon, the steamy breath of caribou, and the bond that comes from sharing such experiences. <br>A unique blend of science, adventure, and personal narrative, the book explores the bounds of the physical body and the tenuousness of life in the company of creatures whose daily survival is nothing short of miraculous. It is a journey through the heart, the mind, and some of the wildest places left in North America.<br><br>In the end, <i>The Sun Is a Compass</i> is a love letter to nature, an inspiring story of endurance, and a beautifully written testament to the resilience of the human spirit.<br></p><p><b>Caroline Van Hemert</b> is a biologist and adventurer whose journeys have taken her from the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean to the swamps of the Okavango Delta.

She lives in Alaska with her husband and two young sons.<br>"What a marvelous book. An enthralling blend of adventure story, insightful memoir, and keen-eyed nature observation.

Caroline Van Hemert follows in the tradition of wilderness adventurers John Muir, Margaret Murie, Cheryl Strayed, and Robert Macfarlane, but she is not one to stick to well-trodden trails. Alongside her husband, she faces predatory bears, roaring rivers, and 4,000 miles of the world's most remote, wild country. She also weaves in her doubts, questions, and insights as a woman and bird biologist. An edge-of-your-seat thrilling read, but with a refreshing humility and grace.

Yet these rallying cries of the Reformation continue to speak to us, addressing a wide range of contemporary issues. The Five Solas series will help you understand the historical and biblical context of the five <em>solas </em>and how to live out the relevance of Reformation theology today.</p><p>In <em>God&#x2019;s Word Alone&#x2014;The Authority of Scripture</em>, scholar and pastor Matthew Barrett looks at the historical and biblical roots of the doctrine that Scripture alone is the final and decisive authority for God&#x2019;s people. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation and traces the crisis that followed resulting in a shift away from the authority of Scripture. Barrett shows that we need to recover a robust doctrine of Scripture&#x2019;s authority in the face of today&#x2019;s challenges and why a solid doctrinal foundation built on God&#x2019;s Word is the best hope for the future of the church.</p></p><p>Matthew Barrett is Associate Professor of Christian Theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, as well as the founder andexecutive editor of Credo Magazine (credomag.com). He is the authorof several books, including Salvation by Grace, Owen on the ChristianLife, God&#39;s Word Alone: The Authority of Scripture, and ReformationTheology: A Systematic Summary. Currently, he is the series editor ofThe 5 Solas Series with Zondervan. You can read more at MatthewMBarrett.com.God&#x2019;s Word Alone is both a fitting tribute to its Reformation sola namesake and a constructive contribution to the doctrine of Scripture in its own right. Sola scriptura has become something of a whipping concept in contemporary theology, but Barrett&#x2019;s book goes a long way to correcting modern and postmodern caricatures of the doctrine. I particularly appreciated the chapters on the Reformers&#x2019; own understanding of Scripture as the supreme and final authority for the church and how this is rooted in its being the only wholly reliable authority, a consequence of its nature as divinely authored and inspired. Barrett here covers all the theological bases &#x2013; biblical, historical, and systematic &#x2013; as one might expect of a home run. -- Kevin J. Vanhoozer, Research Professor of Systematic Theology,Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>Perhaps the greatest crisis in the evangelical world today is the loss of any meaningful commitment to the functional authority of Scripture. While lip service is paid to biblical &#x2018;inspiration&#x2019; and perhaps even some sense of the Bible&#x2019;s &#x2018;infallibility,&#x2019; the final, functional authority of inerrant Scripture to govern both our beliefs and behavior has gradually disappeared. This alone makes Matthew Barrett&#x2019;s book on Sola Scriptura so essential to the church in our day. If the Bible, and the Bible alone, isn&#x2019;t our final and determinative authority, the church will have lost its bearings and be cast hopelessly adrift on the sea of personal subjectivity. It is a massive understatement to say this book is much needed today. I cannot recommend it too highly. -- Sam Storms, Lead Pastor for Preaching and Vision, Bridgeway Church, Oklahoma City, OK<br><br>The 500th anniversary Luther's nailing the ninety-five theses to the door of the chapel of the Wittenberg Castle provides an eminently suitable occasion to remind ourselves of one of the five 'solas' of the Reformation: sola Scriptura, Scripture alone. Matthew Barrett takes his readers through some of the controversies surrounding the Bible that have arisen across this last half-millennium, and competently demonstrates the relevance of the doctrine of Scripture in our day. In the final analysis, the issue is revelation: what is the locus of God's gracious self-disclosure -- God generously giving up his privacy, as Carl Henry used to say? -- D. A. Carson, Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>The Reformation doctrine of sola Scriptura teaches that the Bible is the only infallible and sufficient rule for Christian faith and practice. Matthew Barratt&#x2019;s new study provides persuasive evidence that this doctrine is firmly rooted not only in the Reformation but in the Early Church and in Scripture itself. In very readable prose Barrett graciously provides thoughtful and nuanced responses to the objections of critics of this doctrine. Moreover, he demonstrates that the doctrine of biblical inerrancy has resided as a central teaching of the Western Christian churches since the Patristic era. This is a welcomed and much needed resource for Christians in a day in which much confusion exists regarding the doctrines of sola Scriptura and biblical inerrancy. For this reason, the volume belongs in the libraries not only of teachers, seminary students and pastors but laypersons as well. Highly recommended. -- John D. Woodbridge, Research Professor of Church History and Christian Thought, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>This book---what a feast! Appetizing opening chapters recount how the Bible&#x2019;s authority came to be trashed in the modern West, even in many church circles. Then comes the main course: how God&#x2019;s saving work and presence have always intertwined with his written Word. Lastly, dessert: tasty slices of Scripture&#x2019;s truth, clarity, and sufficiency. A world awash in error and self-destruction cries out for meaning and direction. This book shows why skepticism of Scripture is a bad idea, and why devoting ourselves to studying, living and spreading the Word of God written---inspired, inerrant, and authoritative---holds such promise, for this world and the next. -- Robert W. Yarbrough, Professor of New Testament, Covenant Theological Seminary<br><br>Without belief in Scripture alone as our supreme and trustworthy authority, the very faith of the church must totter. Dr. Barrett has mounted an impressive defence of the key Reformation doctrine of Scripture, demonstrating just how vital it remains today. This book will do great good in grounding the faith of a new generation. -- Michael Reeves, President and Professor of Theology, Union School of Theology, Oxford, England<br><br>Sometimes the doctrine of Scripture is treated as separate from the other doctrines of Christianity---as a sort of preamble to the faith. Helpfully, Barrett draws in the Bible&#x2019;s own Trinitarian, covenantal, and salvation-historical themes to offer a persuasive alternative to various attempts to evade scriptural authority. It&#x2019;s an argument, to be sure, but also an edifying essay that helps us to understand what we&#x2019;re doing when we submit our reason to God&#x2019;s judging and saving speech. -- Michael Horton, J. G. Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>I welcome this fresh study of the formal principle of the Reformation---the belief that God&#x2019;s written Word is the inspired norm by which all other religious authorities and traditions must be judged. Evangelicals are Gospel people and Bible people, and this book shows why adherence to the latter is crucial for the advance of the former. -- Timothy George, Founding dean, Beeson Divinity School of Samford University<br><br>Every generation must think afresh what the foundations of its faith are. The Bible is the unchanging Word of God but our perceptions of its role and relevance deepen as we confront new challenges that our mission to the world throws up. In this clearly presented and closely argued book, Dr. Barrett takes us through the main issues of our time, showing how and why they have arisen and offering ways and means by which they may be addressed. This is a key work and a valuable resource for pastors, teachers and students alike. -- Gerald Bray, Research Professor of Divinity Beeson Divinity School, Samford University</p><h2>How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World</h2><p>&#x2018;[An] irresistible account of a child&#x2019;s imaginary 8,000-mile journey through the earth to discover what&#x2019;s inside.

Hired by a wealthy family to locate their teenage daughter, Sunny is tested by the parents&#x2019; preconceived notion of what a detective should be. With the help of underworld contacts she tracks down the runaway Millicent, who has turned to prostitution, rescues her from a vicious pimp, and finds herself, at thirty-four, the unlikely custodian of a difficult teenager when the girl refuses to return to her family.<br><br>But Millicent&#x2019;s problems are rooted in much larger crimes than running away, and Sunny, now playing the role of bodyguard, is caught in a shooting war with some very serious mobsters. She turns for help to her ex-husband, Richie, himself the son of a mob family, and to her dearest friend, Spike, a flamboyant and dangerous gay man. Heading this unlikely alliance, Sunny must solve at least one murder, resolve a criminal conspiracy that reaches to the top of state government, and bring Millicent back into functional young womanhood.</p><p>Let's get this settled right away: Sunny Randall is nothing like Spenser. True, she's a private eye in Boston with good connections to the cops, and she also knows a lot of bad guys. And yes, she happens to have a trusty sidekick named Spike, and a close friend who could easily be related to Susan Silverman, (Spenser's long-term companion). Oh, did I mention the cute dog? Aside from that, though, there's absolutely no similarity between this new series from Robert B. Parker and his long-running Spenser books. Just because the case Sunny is working on--finding a missing 15-year-old girl who has run away from her very rich parents--sounds similar to the Spenser favorite <i>Thin Air</i> doesn't mean Parker is repeating himself here. Think of it as more like a homage, the kind of thing the author took on when he agreed to finish Raymond Chandler's <i>Poodle Springs</i>. Only in this case it's a homage to himself--but what the hell.<p> Written specifically with Parker's good friend actress Helen Hunt in mind, <i>Family Honor</i> is all in good fun. At one point, a no-nonsense nun looks down at Sunny's bull terrier, who is lying on her back begging for a tummy rub. "What's wrong with this dog?" Sister said. "It is a dog, isn't it?" </p><p> Parker is so good that with one hand tied behind his back he can create characters that are more memorable than most writers can even when pounding away with both fists. In just a few short pages, he tells us all about Sunny's career as a painter--and about the complicated relationship between her cool policeman father and her irritating pseudo-feminist mother. Parker even makes a direct dig at Spenser (who, before turning to private investigating, had a short and fairly unsuccessful career in the boxing world). When the runaway girl questions Sunny's ability to protect her from dangerous criminals--"you're a girl like me, for crissake, what are you going to do?"--Sunny replies, "It would be nice if I weighed two hundred pounds and used to be a boxer. But I'm not, so we find other ways." Exactly. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books.

Eventfully: an ill-considered attempt at flirting sends Charlie Brown to the school doctor... Linus�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s ongoing romance with the too-young �&#x20ac;&#x153;Lydia�&#x20ac; of the many names continues... Snoopy is joined in the trenches by his brother Spike... Sally engages in a career as a playwright by penning the school Christmas play but mixes up Gabriel and Geronimo... A hockey mishap sends Snoopy to the doctor for knee surgery, in a (clearly autobiographical) sequence that lasts only until everyone figures out that dogs don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t have knees... Linus and Lucy�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s kid brother Rerun begins to take on the greater role that will lead to him being one of the dominant characters in the 1990s... and Snoopy, inevitably, writes a �&#x20ac;&#x153;kiss and tell�&#x20ac; book.</p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><h2>About Teaching Mathematics: A K-8 Resource (4th Edition)</h2><p><p>In this fourth edition of her signature resource, Marilyn presents her current thinking and insights and includes ideas from her most recent teaching experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;Part 1, &#x201c;Starting Points,&#x201d; reflects the major overhaul of this book and addresses twenty-three issues important to thinking about teaching mathematics today.</p><p>&nbsp;Part 2, &#x201c;Problem-Solving Investigations,&#x201d; opens with how to plan problem-solving lessons; followed by whole-class, small-group, and individual investigations organized into five areas of the curriculum: Measurement, Data, Geometry, Patterns and Algebraic Thinking, and Number and Operations.</p><p>&nbsp;Part 3, &#x201c;Teaching Arithmetic,&#x201d; focuses on the cornerstone of elementary mathematics curriculum, offering ideas and assessments that build students&#x2019; understanding, confidence, and competence in arithmetic.</p><p>&nbsp;In Part 4, &#x201c;Questions Teachers Ask,&#x201d; features Marilyn&#x2019;s responses to pedagogical questions she&#x2019;s received from teachers over the years.</p>More than forty reproducibles for <i>About Teaching Mathematics</i> are available to download in a printable format.</p><p>Marilyn Burns is one of today's most highly respected mathematics educators.

Instead of Ir�ne, Jean Cocteau accompanied him. In a vain attempt to set himself at the head of the avant-garde, this ambitious young poet had inveigled Picasso into collaborating with him on </i>Parade:<i> a gimmicky, quasi-modernist ballet about the efforts of a couple of shills to lure the public into their vaudeville theater by tantalizing them with samples of their acts. Cocteau had desperately wanted Diaghilev to stage this ballet in Paris. The meddlesome Polish hostess Misia Sert had tried to scupper the project. However, Picasso's Chilean protector and patron, Eugenia Err�zuriz, had persuaded Diaghilev to agree, provided Picasso did the d�cor, Erik Satie the score, and L�onide Massine the choreography. Sets, costumes, and rehearsals were to be done in Rome, where Diaghilev had his wartime headquarters. Picasso's cubist followers were horrified that their avant-garde hero should desert them for anything as frivolous and modish as the Ballets Russes, but he ignored their complaints. After two and a half years of war, with its appalling death toll, its hardships and shortages, and above all the absence of his closest friends</i>&#x2014;<i>particularly Braque and Apollinaire at the front</i>&#x2014;<i>Picasso was elated at the prospect of leaving the bombardments and blackouts behind to spend a couple of months in the relative peace of Rome, which he had always wanted to visit. Besides working on Parade, he was determined to get married.</i>Picasso and Cocteau arrived in Rome on February 19, 1917, a day later than they had intended. Cocteau, who had forgotten to get a visa from the Italian embassy, had lied when telling him that no reservations were available. Diaghilev had booked them into the Grand Hotel de Russie on the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Piazza del Popolo. So that Picasso could work in peace on the costumes and sets for <i>Parade</i>, he had also arranged for him to have one of the coveted Patrizi studios, tucked away in a sprawling, unkempt garden off the Via Margutta. Although most of the artists are now gone, the Patrizi studios are still as idyllic as they were in 1917."I cannot forget Picasso's studio in Rome," Cocteau later wrote. "A small chest contained the maquette for <i>Parade</i>, with its houses, trees and shack. It was there that Picasso did his designs for the Chinese Conjurer, the Managers, the American Girl, the Horse, which Anna de Noailles would compare to a laughing tree, and the Acrobats in blue tights, which would remind Marcel Proust of The <i>Dioscuri</i>."[1] From his window Picasso had a magnificent view of the sixteenth-century Villa Medici, seat of the French Academy, towering above the studio garden. As he well knew, the Academy had associations with some of his favorite artists. Vel�zquez had painted the garden; Ingres had spent four years there as a fellow at the outset of his career and, later, six years as director; Corot had also worked there and caught the golden light of Rome and the <i>campagna</i>, as no other painter had done."Rome seems made by [Corot]," Cocteau reported to his mother. "Picasso talks of nothing else but this master, who touches us much more than Italians hell bent on the grandiose!"[2] That Picasso infinitely preferred the informality of Corot's radiant views to the pomp and ceremony and baroque theatricality of so much Roman painting is confirmed by his sun-filled pointillistic watercolors of the Villa Medici's ochre fa�ade&#x2014;as original as anything he did in Rome.[3]Diaghilev insisted that Picasso and Cocteau share his passion for the city. Sightseeing was compulsory that very first evening. Since there was no blackout as there was in Paris, they were able to see the Colosseum all lit up&#x2014;"that enormous reservoir of the centuries," Cocteau said, "which one would like to see come alive, crowded with people and wild beasts and peanut vendors."[4] The following morning, Diaghilev picked them up in his car for another grand tour. In the evening he took them to the circus. "Sad but beautiful arena," Cocteau wrote his mother. "Misia Sert (or rather her double) performed on the tight rope. Diaghilev slept until woken with a start by an elephant putting its feet on his knees."[5]When he arrived in Rome, Picasso was still suffering from <i>chagrin d'amour</i>. Eager to find a replacement for Ir�ne Lagut, he had promptly fallen in love with one of Diaghilev's Russian dancers, the twenty-five-year-old Olga Khokhlova. Although he courted her assiduously and did a drawing of her, which he signed with his name in Cyrillic, Olga proved adamantly chaste. Chastity was a challenge that Picasso had seldom had to face. Both Diaghilev and Bakst warned him that a respectable Russian woman would not sacrifice her virginity unless assured of marriage. <i>"Une russe on l'�pouse,"</i> Diaghilev said. Olga personified this view. She was indeed respectable: the daughter of Stepan Vasilievich Khokhlov, who was not a general, as she claimed, but a colonel in the Corps of Engineers in charge of the railway system.[6] Olga had three brothers and a younger sister. They lived in St. Petersburg in a state-owned apartment on the Moika Canal. Around 1910, the colonel had been sent to the Kars region to oversee railroad construction, and the family had followed him there. Olga stayed behind. Egged on by a school friend's sister, Mathilda Konetskaya, who had joined the Diaghilev ballet after graduating from the Imperial Ballet School, she decided to become a dancer.Olga had considerable talent. Despite starting late and studying briefly at a St. Petersburg ballet school,[7] she managed to get auditioned by Diaghilev. The Ballets Russes was having difficulty prying dancers loose from the state-run theaters and was desperate for recruits. A committee consisting of Nijinsky and the greatest of classical ballet masters, Enrico Cecchetti, as well as Diaghilev&#x2014;a trio described by another dancer as more terrifying than any first- night audience&#x2014;put Olga through her paces and accepted her. Intelligence and diligence compensated for lack of experience. Nijinsky was sufficiently impressed to pick her out of the corps de ballet.L�onide Massine, who had taken Nijinsky's place in Diaghilev's company as well as in his heart, had chosen Olga to play the role of Dorotea in <i>Les Femmes de bonne humeur</i>, an adaptation of a comedy by the eighteenth-century playwright Goldoni, with sets by L�on Bakst and a heavily arranged score after Scarlatti. It was at a rehearsal for this ballet, which would have its premiere in Rome the following month, that Picasso spotted Olga and immediately set about courting her. To familiarize himself with the techniques of theatrical d�cor as well as watch his new love at work, he helped Carlo Socrate (the scene painter who would work on <i>Parade</i>) execute Bakst's scenery. So that he could join Olga backstage, Picasso even helped the stagehands at the ballet's premiere.[8] Eighteen months later he would marry her.Compared to her predecessors&#x2014;Bohemian models Picasso had lived with in Montmartre or Montparnasse&#x2014;Olga was very much a lady, not, however, the noblewoman biographers have assumed her to be.[9] She came from much the same professional class as Picasso's family. Don Jos�, Picasso's father, may have been a very unsuccessful painter, but his brothers included a diplomat, a revered prelate, and a successful doctor, who had married the daughter of a Malague�o marquis. One of Picasso's mother's first cousins was a general&#x2014;more celebrated than Olga's parent, also the real thing. Indeed, it may have been Olga's lack of blue blood that made her so anxious to become a grande dame and bring up her son like a little prince. Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, who had met Olga in 1916 when the ballet visited San Sebasti�n, remembered her as "a stupid Russian who liked to brag about her father, who she pretended was a colonel in the Tsar's own regiment. The other dancers assured me that he was only a sergeant."[10] This was an exaggeration, but Olga's pretensions were resented by other members of the company.Ten years younger than Picasso, Olga had fine regular features, dark reddish hair, green eyes, a small, lithe, dancer's body, and a look of wistful, Slavic melancholy that accorded with the romanticism of classic Russian ballet. Formal photographs reveal Olga to have been a beauty&#x2014;usually an unsmiling one&#x2014;although in early snapshots of her with Picasso and Cocteau in Rome, she is actually grinning. Later, she plays up to him, dances for him, takes on different personalities, which might explain the widely varying reactions to her. The celebrated ballerina Alexandra Danilova declared that Olga "was <i>nothing</i>&#x2014;nice but nothing. We couldn't discover what Picasso saw in her."[11] A Soviet ballet historian, the late Genya Smakov, found references to her in an unpublished memoir by someone working for Diaghilev, where she is said to have been "neurotic."[12] On the other hand, Lydia Lopokova&#x2014;the most intelligent of Diaghilev's ballerinas&#x2014;was Olga's best friend in the company.Picasso fell for Olga's vulnerability. He sensed the victim within. She would have appealed to his possessiveness and protectiveness especially when the Russian Revolution cut her off from her family. Her vulnerability would likewise have appealed to Picasso's sadistic side. (The women in his life were expected to read the Marquis de Sade.) In the past year rejection by the two women he had hoped to marry had left him exceedingly vulnerable. Picasso's residual bourgeois streak should also be taken into account. He was thirty-five and wanted to settle down with a presentable wife and have a son. None of his father's three brothers had had any issue, and there was pressure from his mother to produce an heir.Sexual abstinence was something Picasso had seldom if ever had to face. His two previous mistresses may have shied away from marrying him, but they had been easy enough to seduce. Olga was as unbeddable as the "nice" Malague�a girls that his family had tried to foist on him. "Don't forget Olga who cares for you very much," she wrote on the back of a dramatic photograph of herself in <i>Firebird</i>. "Who neglects me, loses me."[13] (Cocteau could not resist using the phrase <i>qui me n�glige me perd</i> as a caption to a caricature of Bakst he subsequently sent to Olga.)[14] Picasso must have been very much in love to put up with this ukase. Ernest Ansermet, Diaghilev's principal conductor, describes walking back to the Hotel Minerva, where he and the dancers were staying. Olga had the room next to Ansermet's. "I heard Picasso in the passage knocking at her door and Olga on the other side of it saying 'No, no, Monsieur Picasso, I'm not going to let you in.' "[15] Clearly, marriage was his only option.Diaghilev, who felt responsible for the genteel Russian girls in his company, advised Picasso against marrying Olga. Foreseeing problems with her parents, who were averse to their daughter marrying a mere painter, the impresario told Picasso that he had a much more suitable girl set aside for him. She was currently dancing in South America and would soon be returning to Europe. Picasso would not listen; he was obsessed by Olga. Not that this kept him away from the local brothels, to judge by an address noted down in his Roman sketchbook.[16] "In Rome of an evening," Picasso told Apollinaire, "whores ply their trade in automobiles&#x2014;at walking pace&#x2014;they accost their clients with smiles and gestures and stop the car to negotiate the price."[17] From Naples he would send Apollinaire a postcard: "In Naples all the women are beautiful. Everything is easy here,"[18] and, sure enough, the sketchbook he took with him records the address of a Neapolitan brothel. For an Andalusian, regular visits to a whorehouse would have been an obligatory response to a fianc�e's virtuous stand. Another option was an affair with a less virtuous member of the company. Picasso did that too.[19]Cut off by the war from Russia, Diaghilev and his company led a nomadic life. Their principal wartime base was Rome. Officially the impresario stayed in the Grand Hotel, but he spent most of his time in an apartment in the Marchese Theodoli's palazzo on the Corso that he had rented for L�onide Massine, the handsome twenty-one-year-old dancer, who had been his lover for the previous three years. So as not to compromise himself publicly, Massine had insisted that he and his employer live under separate roofs. That this hot-blooded heterosexual, who was also a cold-blooded operator, should have allowed himself to be captured and caged by the notoriously jealous and possessive Diaghilev is not surprising. In Russia it had been a standard career move for a dancer of either sex to have a rich, influential protector. To negotiate these arrangements, one of the company's dancers, Alexandrov, acted as pimp. Massine's predecessor in Diaghilev's life, the legendary Nijinsky, who was likewise heterosexual, had started off&#x2014;with his mother's blessing&#x2014;as the prot�g� of the rich, young Prince Lvov. The Prince had then handed him on to the Polish Count Tishkievitch, who gave him a piano.[20] Like Diaghilev's previous lover, Dimitri Filosofov, Nijinsky would leave the impresario for a woman; as would Massine.Exceedingly parsimonious and very ambitious, Massine had everything to gain from this arrangement. Diaghilev had already turned him into a star dancer, a choreographer of near genius and a major collector of modern paintings, including many Picassos and Braques. Sex with Diaghilev was part of the job&#x2014;"like going to bed with a nice fat old lady,"[21] as he told one of his mistresses, when she asked how he could possibly have done it with Diaghilev.That Massine was a passionate Hispanophile would prove to be a great bond with Picasso. The previous summer in Madrid, the dancer had agreed to choreograph two ballets with Spanish themes, <i>Las Meninas</i>, which would be put on later in 1917, and <i>Tricorne</i>, which would not appear until 1919. A small, driven, Spanish-looking Russian with enormous eyes&#x2014;in some respects a younger version of Picasso&#x2014;Massine expected the artist to teach him about modern art. He proved so perceptive and imaginative and such a quick learner that over the next ten years he and Picasso would collaborate on four great ballets.Another bond between Picasso and Massine was a passion for women&#x2014;a passion that differentiated them from Diaghilev's largely homosexual entourage. Cocteau's presence in Rome made for more pique and intrigue than usual. In the face of Diaghilev's jealousy, Picasso was delighted to provide his fellow womanizer with an alibi for his amorous escapades. After failing to persuade Picasso to spy for him, Diaghilev hired a couple of detectives to take on this job.[22] At the slightest suspicion of infidelity on Massine's part, Diaghilev would have a temper tantrum, attack the furniture with his stick, tear the telephone out of the wall and smash it.<b>NOTES</b>[1] Jean Cocteau, <i>Oeuvres compl�tes</i>, vol.

And those will be many if sales show DETR is being widely read. </p><p> And it should be widely read, because the potential for events to unfold as described seems inevitable based on current trends. Bracken nails the probability of near future disintigration of the Republic with terrifying prescience. In his words: </p><p> "Reconquista begins five years after the end of EFAD, with a leading character from the first book in a detention camp for suspected terrorists ... this allows the reader to experience a significant deterioration of the state of freedom in American. The plot takes that character on a journey across the Southwest, which is then in the opening stages of a low-intensity civil war." </p><p> Bracken's latest page-turner takes us down dark paths. Their twists fill us with dread. But through this he manages to instill hope -- in his characters and his readers -- that if we can summon up the courage to say, "No more!" and to act, we can once more win back the right to consider ourselves the land of the free and the home of the brave. --David Codrea, GUNS Magazine, February 2007<br><br>John Ross, author of <b>Unintended Consequences</b> </p><p> I ve long felt that one of the most difficult tasks for a novelist to pull off is creating the willing suspension of disbelief in the mind of the reader. It is for this reason that, with very few exceptions, the genre of Science Fiction leaves me cold. Almost always, I find myself feeling that the author is just spewing out an endless stream of whatever made-up nonsense came into his mind. </p><p> The exception to this is when the story asks its audience to accept a single impossibility (or near-impossibility) as fact, and the writer then weaves a What if? tale in which all the characters behave logically and consistently in the face of the one anomaly: What if a man somehow became invisible? (This has been done successfully several times.) What if a twelve-year-old boy found himself in a thirty-year-old body? (The movie Big, with Tom Hanks.) What if the South Africans developed a time machine that could take them and their equipment back to a date in the middle of the Civil War, but no earlier? (Harry Turtledove s Guns of the South.) Stephen King, of course, is the master of making his readers fall into a story with a central premise that is impossible. </p><p> Writers of political novels have considerably less leeway in what they can reasonably ask their readers to accept as a given. Political novels can t ask us to believe something we think is impossible. The further they stray from existing conditions, the more likely the reader (this one, at least) will be unable to accept the imagined situation that the author lays out. In one infamous, racist (and excruciatingly boring) novel, the author gave us an America where, for racial reasons, rape was no longer a crime. Yeah, right. </p><p> Domestic Enemies: the Reconquista doesn t just ask us to accept that Hispanics want to retake the Southwest. It asks us to accept that in a few years they will have nearly completely achieved this goal. In Domestic Enemies, we are shown a New Mexico with a milicia to enforce existing fictional Spanish only and land reform laws. Storefronts with signs printed in English are regularly razed, and large estates owned by gringos are seized and turned over to formerly illegal aliens. All of this is done with official state sanction. Citizens in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona regularly abandon their homes and take only what they can carry in their vehicles to the free states of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. Got the picture? </p><p> Domestic Enemies asks us to assume an America circa 2011 that has secret detention camps for ordinary citizens, an America with hyperinflation (gold $7000/ounce, gasoline $30/gallon), an America that has replaced the old paper currency with new blue bucks at a 1-for-10 exchange rate, an America where lawlessness in the big cities and political corruption everywhere exceeds anything seen in real third-world hellholes in 2006. Is this too much to swallow? You be the judge. </p><p> The action in Domestic Enemies is exciting, and as plausible as you will find in works of fiction. The technical details, at least the ones where I have any expertise, are dead on. The question remains: Is the America of a few years hence portrayed in Domestic Enemies believable? This book addresses in fictional form a serious problem deserving of our attention: the problem of illegal immigration, anchor babies, and the long-term effects of a massive influx of people to our country who have no interest in adopting America s culture of individualism. My fear is that the nightmare conditions Bracken asks us to imagine for 2011 America are so far from what we have now, that mainstream readers (and reviewers) will dismiss his book as delusional ranting. That would be a grave error. --John Ross, The High Road, August 30, 2006</p></p><h2>Ghost Ship (The NUMA Files)</h2><p><b>When NUMA team leader Kurt Austin finds his own memories of a dangerous mission aren't to be trusted, he must follow a trail of mysterious disppearances to the truth in this novel in the #1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling series.</b><br> &nbsp;<br>After a narrow escape during a perilous rescue operation to save the passengers and crew from a sinking yacht, Marine adventurer Kurt Austin awakens with fragmented and conflicting memories.&nbsp;Did he see an old friend and her children drown, or was the yacht abandoned when he came aboard?

The headlights of the big Packard cast yellow beams of light that flickered and bounced and did little to brighten the path ahead. As he stared into the gloom, Swan could see no more than forty yards of the rutted path at any one time.</p><p>&#x201c;How far to this farmhouse?&#x201d; he asked, turning toward a thin, wiry man named Morris, who was wedged in next to the driver.</p><p>Morris checked his watch, leaned toward the driver, and checked the odometer of the truck. After some mental calculations, he glanced down at the map he held. &#x201c;We should be there soon, Inspector. No more than ten minutes to go, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;</p><p>The chief inspector nodded and grabbed the doorsill as the bumpy ride continued. The Packard was known as a Three Ton, the latest from America and one of the first motor vehicles to be owned by the Durban Police Department. It had come off the boat with the customized cab and windshield. Enterprising workmen from the newly formed motor pool had built a frame to cover the flat bed and stretched canvas over it, though no one had done anything to make it more comfortable.</p><p>As the truck bounced and lurched over the rutted buggy trail, Swan decided he would rather be on horseback. But what the big rig lost in comfort it made up for in hauling power. In addition to Swan, Morris, and the driver, eight constables rode in back.</p><p>Swan leaned on the doorsill and turned to look behind him. Four sets of headlights followed. Three cars and another Packard. All told, Swan had nearly a quarter of the Durban police force riding with him.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure we need all these men?&#x201d; Morris asked.</p><p>Perhaps it was a bit much, Swan thought. Then again, the criminals they were after&#x2014;a group known in the papers as the Klaar River Gang&#x2014;had numbers of their own. Rumors put them between thirty and forty, depending on whom one believed.</p><p>Though they&#x2019;d begun as common highwaymen, robbing others and extorting those who tried to make an honest living doing business out in the Veld, they&#x2019;d grown more cunning and violent in the last six months. Farmhouses of those who refused to pay protection money were being burned to the ground. Miners and travelers were disappearing without a trace. The truth came to light when several of the gang were captured trying to rob a bank. They were brought back to Durban for interrogation only to be rescued in a brazen attack that left three policemen dead and four others wounded.</p><p>It was a line that Swan would not allow them to cross. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in a fair fight,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Need I remind you what happened two days ago?&#x201d;</p><p>Morris shook his head, and Swan rapped his hand on the partition that separated the cab from the back of the truck. A panel slid open and the face of a burly man appeared, all but filling the window.</p><p>&#x201c;Are the men ready?&#x201d; Swan asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready, Inspector.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Swan said. &#x201c;Remember, no prisoners tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>The man nodded his understanding, but the words caused Morris to offer a sideways glance.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a problem?&#x201d; Swan barked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; Morris said, looking back at his map. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we&#x2019;re almost there. Just over this hill.&#x201d;</p><p>Swan turned his attention forward once again and took a deep breath, readying himself. Almost immediately he caught the scent of smoke. It was distinct in flavor, like a bonfire.</p><p>The Packard crested the hill moments later, and the coal-black night was cleaved in two by a frenzied orange blaze on the field down below them. The farmhouse was burning from one side to the other, whirls of fire curling around it and reaching toward the heavens.</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody hell,&#x201d; Swan cursed.</p><p>The vehicles raced down the hill and spread out. The men poured forth and took up positions surrounding the house.</p><p>No one hit them. No one fired.</p><p>Morris led a squad closer. They approached from upwind and darted into the last section of the barn that wasn&#x2019;t ablaze. Several horses were rescued, but the only gang members they found were already dead. Some of them half burned, others merely shot and left to die.</p><p>There was no hope of fighting the fire. The ancient wood and the oil-based paint crackled and burned like petrol. It put out such heat that Swan&#x2019;s men were soon forced to back off or be broiled alive.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; Swan demanded of his lieutenant.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like they had it out among themselves,&#x201d; Morris said.</p><p>Swan considered that. Before the arrests in Durban, rumors had been swirling that suggested the gang was fraying at the seams. &#x201c;How many dead?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve found five. Some of the boys think they saw two more inside, but they couldn&#x2019;t reach &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>At that moment gunfire rang out.</p><p>Swan and Morris dove behind the Packard for cover. From sheltered positions, some of the officers began to shoot back, losing stray rounds into the inferno.</p><p>The shooting continued, oddly timed and staccato, though Swan saw no sign of bullets hitting nearby.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold your fire!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;But keep your heads down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re shooting at us,&#x201d; one of the men shouted.</p><p>Swan shook his head even as the pop-pop of the gunfire continued. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just ammunition going off in the blaze.&#x201d;</p><p>The order was passed around, shouted from one man to the next. Despite his own directive, Swan stood up, peering over the hood of the truck.</p><p>By now the inferno had enveloped the entire farmhouse. The remaining beams looked like the bones of a giant resting on some Nordic funeral pyre. The flames curled around and through them, burning with a strange intensity, bright white and orange with occasional flashes of green and blue. It looked like hell itself had risen up and consumed the gang and their hideout from within.</p><p>As Swan watched, a massive explosion went off deep inside the structure, blowing the place into a fiery scrap. Swan was thrown back by the force of the blast, landing hard on his back, as chunks of debris rattled against the sides of the Packard.</p><p>Moments after the explosion, burning confetti began falling, as little scraps of paper fluttered down by the thousands, leaving trails of smoke and ash against the black sky. As the fragments kissed the ground, they began to set fires in the dry grass.</p><p>Seeing this, Swan&#x2019;s men went into action without delay, tamping out the embers to prevent a brushfire from surrounding them.</p><p>Swan noticed several fragments landing nearby. He rolled over and stretched for one of them, patting it out with his hand. To his surprise, he saw numbers, letters, and the stern face of King George staring back at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Tenners,&#x201d; Morris said excitedly. &#x201c;Ten-pound notes. Thousands of them.&#x201d;</p><p>As the realization spread through the men, they redoubled their efforts, running around and gathering up the charred scraps with a giddy enthusiasm they rarely showed for collecting evidence. Some of the notes were bundled and not too badly burned. Others were like leaves in the fireplace, curled and blackened beyond recognition.</p><p>&#x201c;Gives a whole new meaning to the term <i>blowing the loot</i>,&#x201d; Morris said.</p><p>Swan chuckled, but he wasn&#x2019;t really listening, his thoughts were elsewhere; studying the fire, counting the bodies, working the case as an inspector&#x2019;s mind should.</p><p>Something was not right, not right at all.</p><p>At first, he put it down to the anticlimactic nature of the evening. The gang he&#x2019;d come to make war on had done the job for him. That he could buy. He&#x2019;d seen it before. Criminals often fought over the spoils of their crimes, especially when they were loosely affiliated and all but leaderless, as this gang was rumored to be.</p><p>No, Swan thought, this was suspicious on a deeper level.</p><p>Morris seemed to notice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It makes no sense,&#x201d; Swan replied.</p><p>&#x201c;What part of it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The whole thing,&#x201d; Swan said. &#x201c;The risky daylight bank job. The raid to get their men out. The gunfight in the street.&#x201d;</p><p>Morris stared at him blankly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t follow you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look around,&#x201d; Swan suggested. &#x201c;Judging by the storm of burnt cash raining down on us, these thugs were sitting on a small fortune.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Morris agreed. &#x201c;So what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So why rob a heavily defended bank in broad daylight if you&#x2019;re already loaded to the gills with cash? Why risk shooting up Durban to get your mates out only to gun them down back here?&#x201d;</p><p>Morris stared at Swan for a long moment before nodding his agreement. &#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re right. It makes no sense at all.&#x201d;</p><p>The fire continued to burn well into the morning hours, only dying when the farmhouse was consumed. The operation ended without casualties among the police, and the Klaar River Gang was never heard from again.</p><p>Most considered it a stroke of good fortune, but Swan was never convinced. He and Morris would discuss the events of that evening for years, well into their retirement. Despite many theories and guesses as to what really went on, it was a question they would never be able to answer.</p><p></p><p></p><p>170 miles West-Southwest of Durban, July 27, 1909</p><p>The SS <i>Waratah</i> plowed through the waves on a voyage from Durban to Cape Town, rolling noticeably with the growing swells. Dark smoke from coal-fired boilers spilled from her single funnel and was driven in the opposite direction by a contrary wind.</p><p>Sitting alone in the main lounge of the five-hundred-foot steamship, fifty-one-year-old Gavin Br�vard felt the vessel roll ponderously to starboard. He watched the cup and saucer in front of him slide toward the edge of the table, slowly at first, and then picking up speed as the angle of the ship&#x2019;s roll increased. At the last second, he grabbed for the cup, preventing it from sliding off the edge and clattering to the floor.</p><p>The <i>Waratah</i> remained at a sharp pitch, taking a full two minutes to right herself, and Br�vard began to worry about the vessel he&#x2019;d booked passage on.</p><p>In a prior life, he&#x2019;d spent ten years at sea aboard various steamers. On those ships the recoil was quicker, the keel more adept at righting itself. This ship felt top-heavy to him. It made him wonder if something was wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;More tea, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>Deep in thought, Br�vard barely noticed the waiter in the uniform of the Blue Anchor Line.</p><p>He held out the cup he&#x2019;d saved from destruction. <i>&#x201c;Merci.&#x201d;</i></p><p>The waiter topped it off and moved on. As he left, a new figure came into the room, a broad-shouldered man of perhaps thirty, with reddish hair and a ruddy face. He made a direct line for Br�vard, taking a seat in the chair opposite.</p><p>&#x201c;Johannes,&#x201d; Br�vard said in greeting. &#x201c;Glad to see you&#x2019;re not trapped in your cabin like the others.&#x201d;</p><p>Johannes looked a little green, but he seemed to be holding up. &#x201c;Why have you called me here?&#x201d;</p><p>Br�vard took a sip of the tea. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking. And I&#x2019;ve decided something important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what might that be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re far from safe.&#x201d;</p><p>Johannes sighed and looked away. Br�vard understood. Johannes thought him to be a worrier. A fear-laden man. But Br�vard was just trying to be cautious. He&#x2019;d spent years with people chasing him, years living under the threat of imprisonment or death. He had to think five steps ahead just to remain alive. It had tuned his mind to a hyperattentive state.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;re safe,&#x201d; Johannes replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve assumed new identities. We left no trail. The others are all dead, and the barn has been burned to the ground. Only our family continues on.&#x201d;</p><p>Br�vard took another sip of tea. &#x201c;What if we&#x2019;ve missed something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Johannes insisted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re beyond the reach of the authorities here. This ship has no radio. We might as well be on an island somewhere.&#x201d;</p><p>That was true. As long as the ship was at sea, they could rest and relax. But the journey would end soon enough.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re only safe until we dock in Cape Town,&#x201d; Br�vard pointed out. &#x201c;If we haven&#x2019;t covered our trail as perfectly as we think, we may arrive to a greeting of angry policemen or His Majesty&#x2019;s troops.&#x201d;</p><p>Johannes did not reply right away. He was thinking, soaking the information in. &#x201c;What do you suggest?&#x201d; he asked finally.</p><p>&#x201c;We have to make this journey last forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how do we do that?&#x201d;</p><p>Br�vard was speaking metaphorically. He knew he had to be more concrete for Johannes. &#x201c;How many guns do we have?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four pistols and three rifles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the explosives?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two of the cases are still full,&#x201d; Johannes said with a scowl. &#x201c;Though I&#x2019;m not sure it was wise to bring them aboard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; Br�vard insisted. &#x201c;Wake the others, I have a plan. It&#x2019;s time we took destiny into our own hands.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>CAPTAIN JOSHUA ILBERY stood on the <i>Waratah</i>&#x2019;s bridge despite it being time for the third watch to take over. The weather concerned him. The wind was gusting to fifty knots, and it was blowing opposite to the tide and the current. This odd combination was building the waves into sharp pyramids, unusually high and steep, like piles of sand pushed together from both directions.</p><p>&#x201c;Steady on, now,&#x201d; Ilbery said to the helmsman. &#x201c;Adjust as needed, we don&#x2019;t want to be broadsided.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; the helmsman said.</p><p>Ilbery lifted the binoculars. The light was fading as evening came on, and he hoped the wind would subside in the night.</p><p>Scanning the whitecaps ahead of him, Ilbery heard the bridge door open. To his surprise, a shot rang out. He dropped the binoculars and spun to see the helmsman slumping to the deck, clutching his stomach. Beyond him stood a group of passengers with weapons, one of whom walked over and took the helm.</p><p>Before Ilbery could utter a word or grab for a weapon, a ruddy-faced passenger slammed the butt of an Enfield rifle into his gut. He doubled over and fell back, landing against the bulkhead.</p><p>The man who&#x2019;d attacked him aimed the barrel of the Enfield at his heart. Ilbery noticed it was held by rough hands, more fitting on a farmer or rancher than a first-class passenger. He looked into the man&#x2019;s eyes and saw no mercy. He couldn&#x2019;t be sure of course, but Ilbery had little doubt the man he was facing had shot and killed before.</p><p>&#x201c;What is the meaning of this?&#x201d; Ilbery growled.</p><p>One of the group stepped toward him. He was older than the others, with graying hair at the temples. He wore a finer suit and carried himself with the loose elegance of a leader. Ilbery recognized him as one of a group who&#x2019;d come on board in Durban. Br�vard, was the name. Gavin Br�vard.</p><p>&#x201c;I demand an explanation,&#x201d; Ilbery said.</p><p>Br�vard smirked at him. &#x201c;I should have thought it quite obvious. We&#x2019;re commandeering this ship. You&#x2019;re going to set a new course away from the coast and then back to the east. We&#x2019;re not going to Cape Town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious,&#x201d; Ilbery said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in the middle of a bad stretch. The ship is barely responding as it is. To make a turn now would&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Gavin aimed the pistol at a spot halfway between the captain&#x2019;s...</p></p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs</h2><p>For artists, designers, and all with an interest in Buddhist and Tibetan art, this is the first exhaustive reference to the seemingly infinite variety of symbols found throughout Tibetan art in line drawings, paintings, and ritual objects. Hundreds of the author's line drawings depict all the major Tibetan symbols and motifs&#x2014;landscapes, deities, animals, plants, gurus, mudras (ritual hand gestures), dragons, and other mythic creatures&#x2014;ranging from complex mythological scenes to small, simple ornaments.</p><p>Tibetan Buddhism has one of the most complex iconographies of any religion. Robert Beer, the artist who brought to life the saints of Tibetan Buddhism in <i>Buddhist Masters of Enchantment</i>, has now brought the myriad symbols of Tibetan Buddhist art to life. Not exactly arranged like an encyclopedia, this book is more like a tour of the categories of Tibetan Buddhist symbols, beginning with Landscape Elements (rocks, clouds, rainbows, etc.); moving on to such areas as Flowers and Trees, Cosmology, and Mudras (hand gestures); and ending with Geometric Borders. Exquisitely detailed line drawings (using fine-pointed traditional brushes) are grouped on full-size plates, each of which the author tells us took between 50 and 200 hours to draw. The eight years that went into this book are revealed not only in the drawings but also in the text that is equally detailed in its descriptions of the religious significance of the symbols as well as their sources and development in Tibetan art. Beer's encyclopedic knowledge has not come from book learning, but from 30 years of doing Tibetan art and learning firsthand from Tibetan masters. After glimpsing just of few of these plates, you'll be calling Beer a master too. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Robert Beer has studied and practiced Tibetan thangka painting for thirty years, including five years of study with master artists Jampa of Dharamsala and Khamtr�l Rinpoche of Tashijong. Beer is one of the first Westerners to become actively involved in this art form. Over the last two decades he has concentrated on an extensive series of iconographical drawings depicting the major deities, lineage holders, and symbols that occur in the spectrum of Tibetan art.</p><h2>Big Nate: In a Class by Himself (Big Nate, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;<em>Big Nate</em> is funny, big time.&#x201d;--Jeff Kinney, author of <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em></strong></p><p>For fans of the hilarious Diary of a Wimpy Kid series: Get ready to meet Big Nate!

Along with this genetic material, all of the emotional coding and experiences of these planets and species was left, laying the ground for "The Grand Experiment". There are other timelines in which this experiment is not succeeding. But you, the version with which we are having this conversation, are successful and, hence, you are going through the ascension process.<br><br>The information that is shared in this book is what we consider the most appropriate vibrational match for where you are right now.

Some were well trained Jews, others unschooled in Judaism; some rich and wildly successful, others down and out. But their common link was they all had a profound longing for God that gave them no peace until they found God Himself in the Catholic Church.</p><p>Some of these converts are famous people like Edith Stein, Alphonse Ratisbonne, Karl Stern, and Rabbi Zolli, while others are less well known, but all have powerful stories of life-changing spiritual transformations.</p></p><p><b>Roy Schoeman&nbsp;</b>grew up studying Judaism under the most prominent Rabbis in American Judaism. After receiving a B.S. from M.I.T. and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, he taught at Harvard. His conversion to Catholicism led to a dramatic refocus of his activities.God's convenant with Israel was neither revoked nor abolished. It was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, and <i>Honey From the Rock</i> is powerful proof of that fulfillment. Israel's prayer and piety, vocation and sacrifice - all are transformed as they are restored. All find their completion in the lives we encounter here. Pope Pius XI put it well when he said that "Spiritually we are Semites." May all Catholics be enriched by this movement of the Spirit, because for us it's a movement homeward. -- <i>Scott Hahn</i><br><br>Roy Schoeman has given us all a great gift in showing us the mysterious and wonderful ways in which Y'shua, the Messianic Son of David, and His Mother Miryam continue to speak deeply to the longing hearts of that people to whom, more than all others, we Gentiles owe an incalculable debt. --<i>Mark Shea</i><br><br>This book is far more than just another collection of conversion stories. It is a spiritual pathway with each story creating a stepping stone to transformation. These life changing encounters will deepen your faith and provide insights into the riches of the Catholic Church. It is filled with Jewish wit and wisdom and climaxes in the radical transformation of conversion. I highly recommend this book to all who wish to grow deeper and learn about the Faith from a Jewish point of view. You won't be disappointed! --<i>Brother Bob Fishman - B.S.C.D.</i><br><br>This is a gripping book sketching powerfully the Jewish metaphysical restlessness that nothing can satisfy until they taste Honey from the Divine Rock and recognize in Christ the King of the Jews and the Roman Catholic church as the fulfillment of Judaism. This book is a constellation made up of sixteen sons and daughters of Israel for whom overwhelming talents, wordly success, money, pleasure brought nothing but despair. Each one of them had its own path; but what is striking is the role played by the Holy Virgin and the holy hunger for the Eucharist in some of the most amazing conversions. This book will bring joy to its readers and rekindle their hope in the power of God's grace at a time when the ship of Holy Church is battered by the waves of secularism, relativism, infidelity and betrayal. --<i>Alice von Hildebrand</i></p><h2>The Compact Bedford Introduction to Literature</h2><p><p><em>The Compact Bedford Introduction to Literature</em> is a bestseller for a reason: It brings literature to life for students, helping to make them lifelong readers, better writers, and more critical thinkers in any path they choose.

After all, science has cured countless diseases and even sent humans into space. But as Jonah Lehrer argues in this sparkling debut, science is not the only path to knowledge. In fact, when it comes to understanding the brain, art got there first.<br> Taking a group of artists &#x2014; a painter, a poet, a chef, a composer, and a handful of novelists &#x2014; Lehrer shows how each one discovered an essential truth about the mind that science is only now rediscovering. We learn, for example, how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory; how George Eliot discovered the brain&#x2019;s malleability; how the French chef Escoffier discovered umami (the fifth taste); how C�zanne worked out the subtleties of vision; and how Gertrude Stein exposed the deep structure of language &#x2014; a full half-century before the work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists. It&#x2019;s the ultimate tale of art trumping science.<br> More broadly, Lehrer shows that there&#x2019;s a cost to reducing everything to atoms and acronyms and genes. Measurement is not the same as understanding, and art knows this better than science does. An ingenious blend of biography, criticism, and first-rate science writing, Proust Was a Neuroscientist urges science and art to listen more closely to each other, for willing minds can combine the best of both, to brilliant effect.</p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, December 2007: Proust may have been more neurasthenic than neuroscientist, but Jonah Lehrer argues in <i>Proust Was a Neuroscientist</i> that he (and many of his fellow artists) made discoveries about the brain that it took science decades to catch up with (in Proust's case, that memory is a process, not a repository). Lehrer weaves back and forth between art and science in eight graceful portraits of artists (mostly writers, along with a chef, a painter, and a composer) who understood, better at times than atomizing scientists, that truth can begin with "what reality feels like." Sometimes it's the art that's most evocative in his tales, sometimes the science: Lehrer writes about them with equal ease and clarity, and with a youthful confidence that art and science, long divided, may yet be reconciled. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><p>Jonah Lehrer is a Contributing Editor at <i>Wired</i> and a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>.

But back in grade school you presumably learned that Franklin invented a stove, bifocal glasses, and the lightning rod; that he established the first, or almost the first, library, fire department, hospital, and insurance company; that he helped negotiate the treaty with France that allowed America to win independence; that he was a member of the Constitutional Convention; that he was the most famous American of the eighteenth century (after George Washington) and the closest thing we&#x2019;ve ever had to a Renaissance man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Didn&#x2019;t Find Out Until College:<br> That Franklin had as many detractors as admirers, for whom his shrewdness, pettiness, hypocrisy, and nonstop philandering embodied all the worst traits of the American character, of American capitalism, and of the Protestant ethic.<br> &nbsp;<br> WASHINGTON IRVING (1783-1859)<br> &nbsp;<br> Product of:<br> New York City and Tarrytown, New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> Earned a Living as a:<br> Writer; also, briefly, a diplomat.<br> &nbsp;<br> High-School Reading List:<br> &#x201c;Rip Van Winkle&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&#x201d; both contained in The Sketch Book (1820).<br> &nbsp;<br> College Reading List:<br> Other more or less interchangeable selections from The Sketch Book, Bracebridge Hall (1822), Tales of a Traveller (1824), or The Legends of the Alhambra (1832), none of which stuck in anyone&#x2019;s memory for more than ten minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Were Supposed to Have Learned in High School:<br> That Irving was the first to prove that Americans could write as well as Europeans; that Ichabod Crane and Rip Van Winkle&#x2019;s wife both got what they deserved.<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Didn&#x2019;t Find Out Until College:<br> That Irving&#x2019;s grace as a stylist didn&#x2019;t quite make up for his utter lack of originality, insight, or depth.<br> &nbsp;<br> JAMES FENIMORE COOPER (1789-1851)<br> &nbsp;<br> Product of:<br> Cooperstown, New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> Earned a Living as a:<br> Gentleman farmer.<br> &nbsp;<br> High-School Reading List:<br> Probably none; The Leatherstocking Tales, i.e., The Pioneers (1823), The Last of the Mohicans (1826), The Prairie (1827), The Pathfinder (1840), and The Deerslayer (1841) are considered grade-school material.<br> &nbsp;<br> College Reading List:<br> Social criticism, such as Notions of the Americans (1828), a defense of America against the sniping of foreign visitors; or &#x201c;Letter to his Countrymen&#x201d; (1834), a diatribe written in response to bad reviews of his latest novel.<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Were Supposed to Have Learned in High School:<br> That Cooper was America&#x2019;s first successful novelist and that Natty Bumppo was one of the all-time most popular characters in world literature. Also that The Leatherstocking Tales portrayed the conflicting values of the vanishing wilderness and encroaching civilization.<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Didn&#x2019;t Find Out Until College:<br> That the closest Cooper ever got to the vanishing wilderness was Scarsdale, and that, in his day, he was considered an insufferable snob, a reactionary, a grouch, and a troublemaker known for defending slavery and opposing suffrage for everyone but male landowners. That eventually, everyone decided the writing in The Leatherstocking Tales was abominable, but that during the 1920s Cooper&#x2019;s social criticism began to seem important and his thinking pretty much representative of American conservatism.<br> &nbsp;<br> RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882)<br> &nbsp;<br> Product of:<br> Concord, Massachusetts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Earned a Living as a:<br> Unitarian minister, lecturer.<br> &nbsp;<br> High-School Reading List:<br> A few passages from Nature (1836), Emerson&#x2019;s paean to individualism, and a couple of the Essays (1841), one of which was undoubtedly the early, optimistic &#x201c;Self-Reliance.&#x201d; If you were spending a few days on Transcendentalism, you probably also had to read &#x201c;The Over-Soul.&#x201d; If, on the other hand, your English teacher swung toward an essay like &#x201c;The Poet,&#x201d; it was, no doubt, accompanied by a snatch of Emersonian verse&#x2014; most likely &#x201c;Brahma&#x201d; or &#x201c;Days.&#x201d; (You already knew Emerson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Concord Hymn&#x201d; from grade-school history lessons, although you probably didn&#x2019;t know who wrote it.)<br> &nbsp;<br> College Reading List:<br> Essays and more essays, including &#x201c;Experience,&#x201d; a tough one. Also the lecture &#x201c;The American Scholar,&#x201d; in which Emerson called for a proper American literature, freed from European domination.<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Were Supposed to Have Learned in High School:<br> That Emerson was the most important figure of the Transcendentalist movement, whatever that was, the friend and benefactor of Thoreau, and a legend in his own time; also, that he was a great thinker, a staunch individualist, an unshakable optimist, and a first-class human being, even if you wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted to know him yourself.<br> &nbsp;<br> What You Didn&#x2019;t Find Out Until College:<br> That you&#x2019;d probably be a better person if you had known him yourself and that almost any one of his essays could see you through an identity crisis, if not a nervous breakdown.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Solving 9-11: The Deception That Changed the World</h2><p>An independent analysis of the events of September 11, 2001.

During his life, Musonius&#x2019; Stoicism was put to the test, most notably during an exile to Gyaros, a barren island in the Aegean Sea.

Cooking could no longer remain a private passion for Irma. She had recently been widowed and needed to find a way to support her family. Irma was a celebrated St. Louis hostess who sensed that she was not alone in her need for a no-nonsense, practical resource in the kitchen. So, mustering what assets she had, she self-published <i>The Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat.</i> Out of these unlikely circumstances was born the most authoritative cookbook in America, the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from. To date it has sold more than 15 million copies. <br> This is a perfect facsimile of that original 1931 edition. It is your chance to see where it all began. These pages amply reveal why <i>The Joy of Cooking</i> has become a legacy of learning and pleasure for generations of users. Irma's sensible, fearless approach to cooking and her reassuring voice offer both novice and experienced cooks everything they need to produce a crackling crust on roasts and bake the perfect cake. All the old classics are here -- Chicken a la King, Molded Cranberry Nut Salad, and Charlotte Russe to name a few -- but so are dozens of unexpected recipes such as Risotto and Roasted Spanish Onions, dishes that seem right at home on our tables today. <br> Whether she's discussing the colorful personality of her cook Marguerite, whose Cheese Custard Pie was not to be missed, or asserting that the average woman's breakfast was "probably fruit, dry toast, and a beverage" while the average man's was "fruit, cereal, eggs with ham or bacon, hot bread, and a beverage," the distinctive era in which Irma lived comes through loud and clear in every line. Enter a time when such dishes as Shrimp Wiggle and Cottage Pudding routinely appeared on tables across America. <br> The book is illustrated with the silhouette cutouts created by Irma's daughter Marion, who eventually wrote later editions of <i>The Joy of Cooking.</i> Marion also created the cover art depicting St. Martha of Bethany, the patron saint of cooking, slaying the dragon of kitchen drudgery. This special facsimile edition contains both Irma's original introduction and a completely new foreword by her son Edgar Rombauer, whose vivid memories bring Irma's kitchen alive for us all today.</p><p>Suddenly Aunt Eunice is on the phone explaining, "Aunt Mabel won't be with us for Christmas dinner, she's taking a holiday cruise with her bridge club. So would you be a dear and bring the Cheese Custard Pie this year? The family sure loves that pie." You ponder a moment and remember that the Cheese Custard Pie wasn't half bad, a stout and hearty dish with heavy Midwestern overtones, a bit like Aunt Mabel, in fact. You've eaten the same pie every year for as long as you can remember, your parents ate the same pie, and chances are your grandparents got a little crazy and had a slice or two � la mode. Small wonder Mabel has been wowing the family with Cheese Custard Pie since 1931.<p> Warm fuzzy memories go suddenly bad when you realize that the success or failure of the family holiday has just been placed squarely upon your shoulders in the form of a dessert you haven't a clue how to cook. Damn that bridge club! A quick call back to Aunt Eunice reveals, "It's simple, honey, all you need is <i>The Joy of Cooking</i>."</p><p> In 1931, Mrs. Irma von Starkloff Rombauer was newly widowed and in need of a way to support her family. The celebrated St. Louis hostess struck on the idea of turning her personal recipes and cooking techniques into a book. She self- published <i>The Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat</i>, and the legend was born. Aunt Mabels everywhere related to Irma's sensible, fearless approach to the culinary arts, and Chicken � la King, Risotto, and Roasted Spanish Onions found their way onto our tables. <i>The Joy of Cooking</i> quickly became a modern masterpiece, the stuff of legends, the foundation of family dinners everywhere.</p><p> This facsimile of the original 1931 edition offers ample proof why <i>The Joy of Cooking</i>, at 15 million copies and counting, remains one of the most popular cookbooks of all time. This is where it all began, and while her Shrimp Wiggle may not be in vogue anymore, a certain pie recipe just might save your family holiday. <i>--Mark O. Howerton</i></p>These pages reveal why The Joy of Cooking has become a legacy of learning and pleasure for generations of users.

There they meet Dima, a Russian who styles himself the world&#x2019;s Number One money-launderer and who wants, among other things, a game of tennis. Back in London, the couple is subjected to an interrogation by the British Secret service who also need their help. Their acquiescence will lead them on a precarious journey through Paris to a safe house in Switzerland, helpless pawns in a game of nations that reveals the unholy alliances between the Russian mafia, the City of London, the government and the competing factions of the British Secret Service.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author&nbsp;<b>John le Carr�</b> (<i>A Delicate Truth&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>)&nbsp;was born in 1931 and attended the universities of Bern and Oxford. He taught at Eton and served briefly in British Intelligence during the Cold War. For the last fifty years he has lived by his pen. He divides his time between London and Cornwall.<b>1</b><p>At seven o'clock of a Caribbean morning, on the island of Antigua, one Peregrine Makepiece, otherwise known as Perry, an all-round amateur athlete of distinction and until recently tutor in English literature at a distinguished Oxford college, played three sets of tennis against a muscular, stiff-backed, bald, brown-eyed Russian man of dignified bearing in his middle fifties called Dima. How this match came about was quickly the subject of intense examination by British agents professionally disposed against the workings of chance. Yet the events leading up to it were on Perry's side blameless.</p><p>The dawning of his thirtieth birthday three months previously had triggered a life-change in him that had been building up for a year or more without his being aware of it. Seated head in hands at eight o'clock in the morning in his modest Oxford rooms, after a seven-mile run that had done nothing to ease his sense of calamity, he had searched his soul to know just what the first third of his natural life had achieved, apart from providing him with an excuse for not engaging in the world beyond the city's dreaming spires.</p><p>*</p><p>Why?</p><p>To any outward eye, his was the ultimate academic success story. The State-educated son of secondary-school teachers arrives in Oxford from London University laden with academic honours and takes up a three-year post awarded him by an ancient, rich, achievement-driven college. His first name, traditionally the property of the English upper classes, derives from a rabble-rousing Methodist prelate of the nineteenth century named Arthur Peregrine of Huddersfield.</p><p>In the term time, when he isn't teaching, he distinguishes himself as a cross-country runner and sportsman. On his spare evenings he helps out in a local youth club. In vacations he conquers difficult peaks and Most Serious climbs. Yet when his college offers him a permanent Fellowship&#x2014;or to his present soured way of thinking, imprisonment for life&#x2014;he baulks.</p><p>Again: why?</p><p>Last term he had delivered a series of lectures on George Orwell under the title 'A Stifled Britain?' and his rhetoric had alarmed him. Would Orwell have believed it possible that the same overfed voices which had haunted him in the 1930s, the same crippling incompetence, addiction to foreign wars and assumptions of entitlement, were happily in place in 2009?</p><p>Receiving no response from the blank student faces staring up at him, he had supplied it for himself: <i>no</i>, Orwell would emphatically <i>not</i> have believed it. Or if he had, he would have taken to the streets. He would have smashed some serious glass.</p><p>*</p><p>It was a topic he had thrashed out mercilessly with Gail, his longstanding girlfriend, as they lay in her bed after a birthday supper at the flat in Primrose Hill that she had part-inherited from her otherwise penniless father.</p><p>'I don't like dons and I don't like being one myself. I don't like academia and if I never have to wear a bloody gown again, I'll feel a free man,' he had ranted at the gold-brown hair clustered comfortably on his shoulder.</p><p>And receiving no reply beyond a sympathetic purr:</p><p>'Hammering on about Byron, Keats and Wordsworth to a bunch of bored undergraduates whose highest ambition is to get a degree, get laid, and get rich? Done it. Been there. Fuck it.'</p><p>And raising the odds:</p><p>'About the only thing that would <i>really</i> keep me in this country is a bloody revolution.'</p><p>And Gail, a sparky young barrister on the rise, blessed with looks and a quick tongue&#x2014;sometimes a little too quick for her own comfort as well as Perry's&#x2014;assured him that no revolution would be complete without him.</p><p>Both were <i>de facto</i> orphans. If Perry's late parents had been the soul of high-minded Christian socialist abstinence, Gail's were the other thing. Her father, a sweetly useless actor, had died prematurely of alcohol, sixty cigarettes a day and a misplaced passion for his wayward wife. Her mother, an actress but less sweet, had vanished from the family home when Gail was thirteen, and was reputed to be living the simple life on the Costa Brava with a second cameraman.</p><p>*</p><p>Perry's initial reaction to his life-decision to shake the dust of academia from his feet&#x2014;irrevocable, like all Perry's life-decisions&#x2014;was to return to his grass roots. The only son of Dora and Alfred would put himself where their convictions had been. He would begin his teaching career all over again at the point where they had been forced to abandon theirs.</p><p>He would stop playing the intellectual high-flyer, sign up for an honest-to-God teacher-training course and, in their image, qualify as a secondary-school teacher in one of his country's most deprived areas.</p><p>He would teach set subjects, and any sport they cared to throw at him, to children who needed him as a lifeline to self-fulfilment rather than as a ticket to middle-class prosperity.</p><p>But Gail was not as alarmed by this prospect as perhaps he intended her to be. For all his determination to be at the <i>hard centre of life</i>, there remained other unreconciled versions of him, and Gail was on familiar terms with most of them:</p><p>Yes, there was Perry the self-punishing student at London University where they had first met, who in the mould of T. E. Lawrence had taken his bicycle to France in the vacations and ridden it until he keeled over with exhaustion.</p><p>And yes, there was Perry the alpine adventurer, the Perry who could run no race and play no game, from seven-a-side rugby to pass the parcel with her nephews and nieces at Christmas time, without a compulsive need to win.</p><p>But there was also Perry the closet sybarite who treated himself to unpredictable bursts of luxury before hurrying back to his garret. And this was the Perry who stood on the best tennis court at the best recession-hit resort in Antigua on that early May morning before the sun got too high to play, with the Russian Dima one side of the net and Perry the other, and Gail wearing a swimsuit and a broad-brimmed floppy hat and a silky cover-up that covered very little, sitting amid an unlikely assembly of dead-eyed spectators, some dressed in black, who appeared to have sworn a collective oath not to smile, not to speak, and not to express any interest in the match they were being compelled to watch.</p><p>*</p><p>It was a lucky chance, in Gail's opinion, that the Caribbean adventure had been planned in advance of Perry's impulsive life-decision. Its inception dated back to darkest November when his father had fallen victim to the same cancer that had carried off his mother two years earlier, leaving Perry in a state of modest affluence. Not holding with inherited wealth, and being in two minds as to whether he should give all he had to the poor, Perry dithered. But after a campaign of attrition mounted by Gail, they had settled for a once-in-a-lifetime bargain tennis holiday in the sun.</p><p>And no holiday could have been better planned, as it turned out, for by the time they had embarked on it, even bigger decisions were staring them in the face:</p><p>What should Perry do with his life, and should they do it together?</p><p>Should Gail give up the Bar and step blindly into the azure yonder with him, or should she continue to pursue her meteoric career in London?</p><p>Or might it be time to admit that her career was no more meteoric than most young barristers' careers, and should she therefore get herself pregnant, which was what Perry was forever urging her to do?</p><p>And if Gail, either out of impishness or self-defence, had a habit of turning large questions into little ones, there remained no doubt that the two of them were separately and together at life's crossroads with some pretty heavy thinking to do, and that a holiday in Antigua looked like providing the ideal setting in which to do it.</p><p>*</p><p>Their flight was delayed, with the result that they didn't check into their hotel till after midnight. Ambrose, the resort's ubiquitous major-domo, showed them to their cabin. They rose late and by the time they had breakfasted on their balcony the sun was too hot for tennis. They swam on a three-quarters-empty beach, had a solitary lunch by the pool, made languorous love in the afternoon, and at six in the evening presented themselves at the pro's shop, rested, happy, and eager for a game.</p><p>Seen from a distance, the resort was no more than a cluster of white cottages scattered along a mile-wide horseshoe of proverbial talcum-powder sand. Two promontories of rock strewn with scrub forest marked its extremities. Between them ran a coral reef and a line of fluorescent buoys to ward off nosy motor yachts. And on hidden terraces wrested from the hillside lay the resort's championship-standard tennis courts. Meagre stone steps wound between flowering shrubs to the front door of the pro's shop. Once through it, you entered tennis heaven, which was why Perry and Gail had chosen the place.</p><p>There were five courts and one centre court. Competition balls were kept in green refrigerators. Competition silver cups in glass cases bore the names of champions of yesteryear and Mark, the overweight Australian pro, was one of them.</p><p>'So what sort of level are we looking at here, if I may inquire?' he asked with heavy gentility, taking in without comment the quality of Perry's battle-scarred racquets, his thick white socks and worn but serviceable tennis shoes, and Gail's neckline.</p><p>For two people past their first youth but still in the bloom of life, Perry and Gail made a strikingly attractive pair. Nature had provided Gail with long, shapely legs and arms, high, small breasts, a lissome body, English skin, fine gold hair and a smile to light the gloomiest corners of life. Perry had a different sort of Englishness, being lank and at first sight dislocated, with a long neck and prominent Adam's apple. His stride was ungainly, he seemed to topple and his ears protruded. At his State school he had been awarded the nickname of Giraffe, until those unwise enough to use it learned their lesson. But with manhood he had acquired&#x2014;unconsciously, which only made it more impressive&#x2014;a precarious but undoubted grace. He had a mop of brown curls, a wide, freckled forehead, and large, bespectacled eyes that gave out an air of angelic perplexity.</p><p>Not trusting Perry to blow his own trumpet, and protective of him as always, Gail took the pro's question upon herself.</p><p>'Perry plays qualifiers for Queen's and he got into the main draw once too, didn't you? You actually made it to the Masters. And that was after breaking his leg skiing and not playing for six months,' she added proudly.</p><p>'And you, madam, if I may make so bold?' Mark the obsequious pro inquired, with a little more spin on the 'madam' than Gail cared for.</p><p>'I'm his rabbit,' she replied coolly, to which Perry said, 'Sheer bollocks,' and the Australian sucked his teeth, shook his heavy head in disbelief and thumbed the messy pages of his ledger.</p><p>'Well, I've got one pair here might do you good people. They're a sight too classy for my other guests, I'll tell you that right now. Not that I've a vast selection of humanity to choose from, frankly. Maybe you four should give each other a whirl.'</p><p>Their opponents turned out to be an Indian honeymoon couple from Mumbai. The centre court was taken, but court 1 was free. Soon a handful of passers-by and players from other courts had drifted over to watch the four of them warm up: fluid strokes from the baseline casually returned, passing shots that nobody ran for, the unanswered smash from the net. Perry and Gail won the toss, Perry gave first serve to Gail who twice double-faulted and they lost the game. The Indian bride followed her. Play remained sedate.</p><p>It wasn't till Perry began serving that the quality of his play became apparent. His first serve had height and power, and when it went in, there wasn't much anyone could do about it. He served four in a row. The crowd grew, the players were young and good-looking, the ball boys discovered new heights of energy. Towards the end of the first set, Mark the pro casually turned out to take a look, stayed for three games, then with a thoughtful frown returned to his shop.</p><p>After a long second set, the score was one set each. The third and final set reached 4 &#x2013; 3, with Perry and Gail having the edge. But if Gail was inclined to hold back, Perry was by now in full cry, and the match ended without the Indian couple winning another game.</p><p>The crowd drifted away. The four lingered to exchange compliments, fix a return and maybe catch a drink in the bar this evening? You bet. The Indians departed, leaving Perry and Gail to gather up their spare racquets and pullovers.</p><p>As they did so, the Australian pro returned to the court bringing with him a muscular, erect, huge-chested, completely bald man wearing a diamond-encrusted gold Rolex wristwatch and grey tracksuit bottoms kept up by a drawstring tied in a bow at his midriff.</p><p>*</p><p>Why Perry should have spotted the bow at his midriff first and the rest of the man afterwards is easily explained. He was in the act of changing his elderly but comfortable tennis shoes for a pair of beach shoes with rope soles, and when he heard his name called he was still bent double. Therefore he lifted his long head slowly, the way tall, angular men do, and registered first a pair of leather espadrilles on small, almost feminine feet set piratically apart, then a couple of stocky, tracksuited calves in grey; and, coming up, the drawstring bow that kept the trousers aloft, double-tied as such a bow should be, given its considerable area of responsibility.</p><p>And above the bow-line, a belly of finest crimson cotton blouse encasing a massive torso that seemed not to know its stomach from its chest, and rising to an Eastern-style collar that if fastened would have made a cut-down version of a clerical dog-collar, except that there was no way it could have accommodated the muscular neck inside it.</p><p>And above the collar, tipped to one side in appeal, eyebrows raised in invitation, the creaseless face of a fifty-something man with soulful brown eyes beaming a dolphin smile at him. The absence of creases did not suggest inexperience, rather the opposite. It was a face that to Perry the outdoor adventurer seemed cast for life: the face, he told Gail much later, of a formed man, another definition that he aspired to himself, but for all his manly striving did not feel he had yet attained.</p><p>'Perry, allow me to present my good friend and patron, Mr <i>Dima</i> from Russia,' said Mark, injecting a ring of ceremony into his unctuous voice. 'Dima thought you played a pretty nifty match out there, am I right, sir? As a fine connoisseur of the game of tennis, he's been watching you highly appreciatively, I think I may say, Dima.'</p><p>'Wanna game?' Dima inquired, without taking his brown, apologetic gaze off Perry, who by now was hovering awkwardly at his full height.</p><p>'Hi,' said Perry, a bit breathlessly, and shoved out a sweated hand. Dima's was the hand of an artisan turned to fat, tattooed with a small star or asterisk on the second knuckle of the thumb. 'And this is Gail Perkins, my partner in crime,' he added, feeling a need to slow the pace a bit.</p><p>But before Dima could respond, Mar...</p></p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Stories for Young Readers (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Twelve of Shakespeare's greatest tales come to life in this entertaining collection of short, lively stories specially adapted for young readers.

Whereas most historians have argued that Hitler underestimated the American threat, Simms shows that Hitler embarked on a preemptive war with the United States precisely because he considered it such a potent adversary. The war against the Jews was driven both by his anxiety about combatting the supposed forces of international plutocracy and by a broader desire to maintain the domestic cohesion he thought necessary for survival on the international scene.<br>A powerfully argued and utterly definitive account of a murderous tyrant we thought we understood, <i>Hitler</i> is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the origins and outcomes of the Second World War.<br></p><p><b>Brendan Simms</b> is a professor in the History of International Relations and fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge. He is the author of eight previous books, including<i> The Longest Afternoon: The 400 Men Who Decided the Battle of Waterloo</i> and <i>Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy, from 1453 to the Present</i>, shortlisted for the Lionel Gelber Prize. He lives in Cambridge, UK."A powerful new biography."&#x2015;<b>Timothy Snyder</b>, <b><i><b><i>New York Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This vivid and painstakingly researched volume revises fundamentally how historians ought to view the geopolitical motivations of the Nazi leader. Simms argues that Hitler did not see the Soviet Union as the primary obstacle to his expansionist ambitions. From the start, his real enemies were the United Kingdom and the United States.... Engaging and essential reading for anyone interested in Hitler's policymaking."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Foreign Affairs</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[<i>Hitler</i>] challenges some of our longstanding ideas about the man who ruled Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945...Highly provocative."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Financial Times </i></b></i></b><br><br>"[Simms] builds on previous scholarship to make a bold thesis-that Hitler's principal obsession was not communism but rather 'Anglo-America' and global capitalism...A vigorous, original study that adds to the ongoing scholarship."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A radically new assessment of the Fuhrer's world view and the motivation for his plunging the world into a terminal struggle for survival."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Daily Mail</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Simms...challeng[es] much recent scholarship...A preoccupation with Anglo-American capitalism, he contends, drove the Third Reich's ideology in its formative years, more than the oft-cited obsession with Bolshevism...He has made sound use of the Bavarian archives."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Observer</i></b></i></b><br><br>"If many Hitler books are scarcely worth reading, this one commands attention through its originality and sheer intelligence...A thoroughly thought-provoking, stimulating biography which all historians of the Third Reich will have to take seriously."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Irish Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Impressive and intriguing...By drawing our attention to the centrality of historical emigration to Hitler's racial vision of a Great Germany, Simms adds a new dimension to our understanding of the thinking that drove history's most notorious figure. Crisply written and well-researched, there is much in this book that enlightens and stimulates."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The Interpreter</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Simms argues forcefully that [Hitler's] primary motivation was a fear that Germany would be crushed by the Anglo-Saxon capitalism epitomised by the US and the British Empire."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>History Today</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A pathbreaking and elegantly written account of Hitler and his foreign policy that is rooted in the existing literature but goes beyond it to make new claims. Simms marshals considerable evidence to show that Hitler was more preoccupied with a worldwide struggle with America and Britain then he was by Jews and Bolshevism. His claims of Aryan racial superiority masked concerns about German inferiority; he hoped to improve the 'racial stock' by positive as well as negative eugenics. Simms rejects revisionist claims that see Hitler's foreign policy as constrained or compelled by German society and institutions. A must read for anyone interested in the Third Reich and the long shadow it cast over the 20th century."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Richard Ned Lebow, professor of War Studies, King's College London</b></i></b></p><h2>A Tale of Two Biddies: A New Wrinkle on Aging with Grace</h2><p><p>Aging is a gift&#x2014;a privilege best enjoyed with open arms and a grateful heart.<br><br> Meet Kitty and Mardel, also affectionately known as St. Katherine and the Dragon Lady.

Michael Quinn masterfully reconstructs an earlier age, finding ample evidence for folk magic in nineteenth-century New England, as he does in Mormon founder Joseph Smith&#x2019;s upbringing. Quinn discovers that Smith&#x2019;s world was inhabited by supernatural creatures whose existence could be both symbolic and real. He explains that the Smith family&#x2019;s treasure digging was not unusual for the times and is vital to understanding how early Mormons interpreted developments in their history in ways that differ from modern perceptions. Quinn&#x2019;s impressive research provides a much-needed background for the environment that produced Mormonism.<br><br>This thoroughly researched examination into occult traditions surrounding Smith, his family, and other founding Mormons cannot be understated. Among the practices no longer a part of Mormonism are the use of divining rods for revelation, astrology to determine the best times to conceive children and plant crops, the study of skull contours to understand personality traits, magic formula utilized to discover lost property, and the wearing of protective talismans. Ninety-four photographs and illustrations accompany the text.&nbsp;</p><p>D. Michael Quinn was born in 1944 in Pasadena, California. He studied English and philosophy at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah&#x2014;interrupted by a two-year LDS proselytizing mission to England (1963-65)&#x2014;and graduated in 1968. Then followed three years of military service in Germany as a counter-intelligence agent. <p>When he returned from Europe in 1971, Quinn began a master's program in history at the University of Utah and half-time employment at the LDS Church Historian's Office. He received his M.A. in 1973, then moved to New Haven, Connecticut, to continue his studies in history at Yale University. While a graduate student Quinn published in Brigham Young University Studies, the Journal of Mormon History, New York History, the Pacific Historical Review, and Utah Historical Quarterly. When he received his Ph.D. from Yale in 1976, his dissertation on the Mormon hierarchy as an elite power structure won the Frederick W. Beinecke and George W. Egleston awards. </p><p>That same year Quinn began twelve years of employment as a member of BYU's history faculty. He received post-doctoral training in quantitative history at the Newbery Library in Chicago in 1982, and the next year served as associate director of BYU's Vienna study-abroad program.

In 1992 LDS church headquarters affirmed that view in its official Encyclopedia of Mormonism, which mentioned the influence of treasure-digging folk magic (see ch. 2) in five separate entries concerning Joseph Smith. These articles did not list my book in their source-notes, but one did cite an anti-Mormon minister&#39;s article about this topic in a Protestant evangelical magazine. Nevertheless, I was pleased to see this ripple-effect from the splash of Early Mormonism and the Magic World View. As Richard L. Bushman recently wrote in a review for FARMS, &#34;the magical culture of nineteenth-century Yankees no longer seems foreign to the Latter-day Saint image of the Smith family.</p><h2>Trust After Trauma: A Guide to Relationships for Survivors and Those Who Love Them</h2><p>Trauma survivors are often dismayed to find that traumatic events not only shatter their internal sense of well-being, but also leave them withdrawn or isolated.

Extremely large skeletons ranging from 7 feet up to a staggering 18 feet tall have been reportedly uncovered in prehistoric mounds, burial chambers, caves, geometric earthworks, and ancient battlefields. Strange anatomic anomalies such as double rows of teeth, horned skulls, massive jaws that fit over a modern face, and elongated skulls have also been reported. Many of these discoveries were sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., seemingly never to be heard about again. The Smithsonian's own records describe at least 17 giant skeletons in annual reports. This book examines a possible cover-up initiated by Smithsonian scientists starting in the late 1800s. The origins of �&#x20ac;&#x153;the tall ones�&#x20ac; has been shrouded in mystery for centuries, but this book reveals where they came from, why they got so large, and the reason for their downfall, using the latest scientific research, genetic data, native myths, news reports, and ethnological research. This has become one of the most gripping stories of the last few centuries and for the first time the truth of the giants of North America has been revealed. This book also reveals: How early explorers to America witnessed these giants firsthand, including Sir Francis Drake, John Smith and even some of the early presidents; Legends and myths that talk of cannibalistic, red-haired giants; Strange inscriptions, metal armor, mummified remains, and sophisticated technologies buried with the skeletons; How secret societies such as the Rosicrucians, Freemasons and Theosophists all claim the existence of giant humans in the past as historical fact in their literature; and How the giants may be connected to the Denisovans from Siberia, the Nephilim of Bible tradition, and other ancient cultures.</p><p>Jim Vieira is a stonemason, writer and star of History Channel�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Search for the Lost Giants with his brother Bill.

Many of the verses presented here had been lost and are presented here for the first time in print. De Burgos broke new ground in her poetry by fusing a romantic temperament with keen political insights. This book will be essential reading for lovers of poetry and for feminists.</p><p><b>From the Introduction<br><br>One summery day in Puerto Rican East Harlem, I leaned on the sidewalk fence in front of the headquarters of the Association of Puerto Rican Postal Employees. The three story brick building on 109th Street near the corner of Lexington Avenue and its ample stoop were a favorite hang-out for our gang, the Senecas. Sometimes twelve or fifteen of us would sit all over the steps leading to the parlor floor entrance. The caretakers of the building were very tolerant of our congregating on their steps and did not normally chase us away. They knew us to be one of the peaceful gangs of East Harlem in those years when I was just a teen-ager--the 1950s.<br><br>That particular day there was just myself and a man whose name I now forget--a street friend who frequently stopped to chat and tell us jokes. That day, standing in a hot sun, we were talking in the late afternoon. Suddenly, a group of four or five men came around the corner and with them there was a woman. The men were all ruddy and disheveled. They spoke and laughed loudly and you could see several pints of rum or wine among them. We assumed that they had just come from the liquor store on 110th Street and Lexington Avenue.<br><br>In the midst of the five men there was a woman. A tall woman, as tall as the tallest man, and taller than several of them.&nbsp; As the animated band walked by, my friend straightened up and watched them intensely. When they had passed, he asked me, "Do you know who that woman was?" I said "no," expecting him to crack some joke. But he remained very serious and looking after the swaying chattering group said, "That was Julia de Burgos, Puerto Rico's most famous poet." I looked at him for signs that he was kidding, but he was dead serious. Then he looked at me and said "You have to be careful drinking."<br><br>Then the conversation changed, and I forgot about Julia de Burgos until one day I was about to enter Central Park at the Pioneer's Gate on 110th Street, when I noticed off to the left of the lion-mouthed, horse-watering fountain, a group of men sitting and standing near one of the benches on Fifth Avenue outside the park. Sitting on the bench was Julia de Burgos. But I was too self conscious to stare, an </b> <b></b>Julia de Burgos, born in Puerto Rico in 1914, was an accomplished poet and journalist who was revolutionary in her politics, poetry, and feminism. Avidly supporting the cause of Puerto Rican independence, she was also an internationalist who was anti-Franco, anti-Trujillo, and anti-Somoza. As a feminist and Puerto Rican independentista she paid for her convictions and strength by being persecuted as a political figure. A cultural icon, Julia de Burgos was shamefully neglected as a poet during her lifetime. She died in New York City in 1953.</p><h2>Remnant: Force Heretic I (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order)</h2><p><b><i>As the bloodied and weary galaxy faces battle once more, the Jedi take on the formidable task of bringing the last of the Empire into the light. . . .</i></b><br><br>From the ashes of the New Republic&#x2014;torn to shreds by the savage Yuuzhan Vong forces&#x2014;the newly formed Galactic Alliance has risen, determined to bring peace to the entire galaxy.

With Coruscant currently in the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong, Mon Calamari had been selected as a temporary capital and now played host to the representatives of the Galactic Alliance-a group much smaller than a full meeting of the Senate had once been, before the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, but still several hundred strong.<br><br>They responded to the call to fight in the fashion preferred by their individual species. There were whistles, grunts, shrieks, and subsonic rumbles. Some waved appendages; others stamped their feet. And others still, Leia Organa Solo among them, remained silent. She stood completely motionless, gently extending herself into the Force to feel it crackle and flare from the conflicting emotions of those gathered around her.<br><br>The speaker, a sour-faced Sullustan by the name of Niuk Niuv, paced the floor with an energy that belied his size. Clearly agitated by the sudden commotion, he lifted one hand to his ear to indicate his discomfort, while the other attempted to motion the crowd to silence. Even with his audio dampeners in place, the level of noise around the hall still hurt his sensitive ears.<br><br>"We have them on the back foot," he said, his large black eyes roaming the assembly. "They are overextended and ill prepared to defend themselves. They didn't expect to have to defend themselves so late in the game-which is precisely why we must drive home this advantage! To ignore the opportunity we have been given would be like putting our collective head back on the chopping block!"<br><br>"And who took it off the block in the first place?" The call came from the far side of the chamber. Leia immediately recognized the voice as belonging to Thuv Shinev of the Tion Hegemony.<br><br>Niuk Niuv's face contorted into a fleshy snarl. "That is irrelevant," he said irritably.<br><br>"Really?" Shinev bellowed. "I wouldn't have thought so. Too long have some among us treated the Jedi with contempt and suspicion. If we do have the chance now, finally, to force the Yuuzhan Vong back, then we should at least acknowledge their opinions on the subject!"<br><br>"If you think it necessary, then by all means thank them," the Sullustan retaliated. "I'm not saying they don't deserve that. But to do anything less than strike back at the Yuuzhan Vong would be madness, no matter what the Jedi say! We must prove to the Vong that we cannot be subjugated and will not tolerate their oppression! They have done enough. It is time for us to show them who this galaxy really belongs to! We must strike back hard, and we must do it now."<br><br>A scattered cheer rose up among the Senators. It was loud, but not as deafening as Leia had feared it might be. After so many crushing defeats, most of the representatives remained uncertain that the Yuuzhan Vong could be rolled back as easily as Niuk Niuv stated. But the willingness to try was undeniable.<br><br>As Leia's gaze swept the crowd, she caught the tall, long-faced figure of Kenth Hamner on the far side of the chamber. From the scowl on the Jedi Master's face, Leia felt sure he was about to speak out against Niuk Niuv. But it was another who voiced their concerns.<br><br>"What if you're right?" Leia identified Releqy A'Kla, daughter of Camaasi Senator Elegos A'Kla, who had been ritually murdered by the Yuuzhan Vong's Commander Shedao Shai in the early days of the war. Since she had already served in his stead during his absence, her people had voted her into her father's position for the duration of the crisis. "What if we can beat them?"<br><br>"Then we win!" Niuk Niuv's big, round eyes were bright with anticipated glory.<br><br>"But at what cost?" A'Kla's fine, golden down shivered with intense emotion. "The Yuuzhan Vong fight to the death, Senator. Admiral Ackbar used this very fact against them at Ebaq Nine. I don't think you truly realize what this means."<br><br>"I realize," the Sullustan said. "And I realize that it is not our responsibility. If the positions were reversed, they would undoubtedly do the same to us."<br><br>"I'm sorry, but my people cannot support such extermination under any circumstances," she said. She brought her long, three-fingered hands up to her chest. "We are pacifists, Senator. We do not wish such horrors on our consciences."<br><br>"And I respect your people's ethics," Niuk Niuv replied. Turning from her to address the entire chamber, he continued: "If there was an alternative, then I would consider it. But in the absence of any such alternative, I am not prepared to sit back with my neck out waiting for the Yuuzhan Vong to bring an amphistaff down upon it!"<br><br>Another cheer rippled around the room.<br><br>"It's all very good for the pacifists to argue about compassion and restraint, but it is they who will benefit from the ultimate peace that we will bring about with our actions!" Niuv faced Releqy A'Kla once again. "What good is pacifism if you are dead, Senator?"<br><br>Releqy A'Kla sank back into her chair, blinking in dismay.<br><br>"We will crush the Yuuzhan Vong," Niuk Niuv concluded to the Galactic Alliance representatives gathered, punching a fist into the air. "And we will send their remains back where they came from!"<br><br>The cheer was louder this time. Leia's fellow Alderaanian, Chief of State Cal Omas, said nothing. It would have been pointless at this stage, with the majority now so evidently behind Niuk Niuv's sentiments.<br><br>Across from her, Leia saw Hamner's scowl deepen as he shook his head and slipped silently from the huge hall.<br><br>"Finally, we are vindicated."<br><br>In a room not far from the domed hall in which the Senators met, a gathering of Jedi Knights and Masters looked similarly reduced in numbers but was no less passionate. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker had called the meet- ing to discuss strategies for the coming stages of the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. Waxarn Kel, the current speaker, paced in front of the gathering like a caged howlrunner. His face and hairless scalp were pink with fresh scars, indicating just how close he had come to being another victim of the Yuuzhan Vong anti-Jedi vendetta.<br><br>"Explain," Luke said. He sat on the stage at the front of the chamber, one knee raised to support the elbow of his right arm, and that hand supporting his chin. The unnatural coolness of the hand's artificial skin against his jaw helped keep his head clear.<br><br>Kel looked up at him with a frown. "Do I really need to?" he asked with a mix of irritation and surprise. Then, to the rest of the Jedi, he said, "We've been slandered, hunted, and butchered from one side of the galaxy to the other. We became the scapegoat for everything the New Republic brought upon itself because of its complacency and inability to act. We told them things they didn't want to hear, and what was our reward? We were damned for it, that's what. But now we have been vindicated. The trap on Ebaq Nine and the defeat of the Yuuzhan Vong have shown that we are a force to be reckoned with. Vergere's sacrifice will not be in vain."<br><br>"I hadn't realized that our fight was with the survivors of the New Republic," said Kyp Durron, leaning in flight uniform against one of the chamber's fluted walls, arms folded across his chest. "I thought our battle was with the Yuuzhan Vong."<br><br>"It is." Kel regarded Kyp with some annoyance. "The Yuuzhan Vong are our enemy-not just of every peaceful citizen of the galaxy, but of the Jedi in particular. That's been the frustrating thing about this war. The New Republic has thwarted our every attempt to defend ourselves. If it wasn't the Peace Brigade actually trapping us and selling us over, it was idiots like Borsk Fey'lya holding us back. Well, now we're free to act, and we can show them just what we are capable of doing!"<br><br>"I presume you have something in mind." Kyp's expression was neutral, but Luke sensed a cautious interest lurking behind it-like that of someone poking at a bug's nest with a stick to see what might emerge.<br><br>"Of course," Kel said. "We strike, and we strike hard."<br><br>"The Yuuzhan Vong?"<br><br>"Of course the Yuuzhan Vong!" Kel's eyes flashed anger. "We must act to ensure that public opinion doesn't turn against us once again."<br><br>"How might it do that, Waxarn?" Luke asked.<br><br>Kel glanced back up at Luke. The Master could feel the scarred young Jedi Knight consciously bringing his emotions into line.<br><br>"I fear it could happen all to easily, Master," he said, bowing slightly. "Unless we act decisively to reaffirm our usefulness and goodwill, to prove beyond the slightest doubt that the war can only be won with our assistance, then we risk looking weak. Or worse, looking as if our loyalty to the Galactic Alliance is weak."<br><br>Luke smiled sagely. "Surely our loyalty is to peace."<br><br>"First and foremost, yes, Master," Kel put in quickly. "But you have to be strong to protect peace from those who would destroy it. Sometimes it is necessary to fight in order to bring an end to fighting. Isn't that the way of the Jedi?"<br><br>Is it? Luke asked himself as he pondered the words of the young man before him. Luke himself had acted more than once on the philosophy espoused by Waxarn Kel and those like him. The cry had been taken up several times throughout the war with the Yuuzhan Vong by those tempted to take the seemingly easy route through the dark side rather than brave the ambiguities of the Force.<br><br>Luke didn't think Kel had fallen to the dark side, though. There was none of the anger and hatred in the young man that Luke could sense in a handful of others presently around him. They remained quiet, allowing Kel to speak their words for them. But it wasn't difficult for Luke to read their feelings. So many had been hurt by the Yuuzhan Vong and the Peace Brigaders that desiring retribution was, perhaps, only natural. Natural wasn't necessarily right, though, and part of Luke's job was to ensure that those in his charge weren't led astray.<br><br>None of the Jedi in the room had yet fallen to the dark side, and for that he was thankful. Some of them had taken a wrong turning here and there, just as some were being tempted to do now. But Luke had faith in all of them-even those who disagreed vehemently with his own opinions. He was sure that the collective wisdom of the Jedi, their strong belief in the healing, sustaining energies of the Force, would gradually assuage the grief they all felt for loved ones who had died in the war-as well as for themselves.<br><br>Luke straightened and dropped down onto the floor of the room to face Waxarn Kel. Once considered handsome, he was now scarred almost beyond recognition. And it was from this that Luke felt the man's emotions stemmed. Every time Kel looked in the mirror, he would be reminded of what the war had done to him and those he loved, and his anger and hatred would grow.<br><br>The dark side can beckon to us from so many quarters, Luke thought.</p><h2>Toward a Psychology of Awakening: Buddhism, Psychotherapy, and the Path of Personal and Spiritual Transformation</h2><p>How can we connect the spiritual realizations of Buddhism with the psychological insights of the West? In <i>Toward a Psychology of Awakening </i> John Welwood addresses this question with comprehensiveness and depth. Along the way he shows how meditative awareness can help us develop more dynamic and vital relationships and how psychotherapy can help us embody spiritual realization more fully in everyday life. Welwood's psychology of awakening brings together the three major dimensions of human experience: personal, interpersonal, and suprapersonal, in one overall framework of understanding and practice.</p><p>Have you ever noticed that self-described spiritual people are not necessarily all that easy to be with? John Welwood has a term for what often happens--spiritual bypassing. This is when a person reaches for the stars while forgetting about the goop on his shoes. Welwood, author of the popular <i>Love and Awakening</i> and <i>Journey of the Heart</i> has made a profession out of bringing East and West together, integrating the path to enlightenment with the techniques of psychotherapy. In <i>Toward a Psychology of Awakening</i>, Welwood integrates a series of his articles written over a period of 30 years in an attempt to explain the dynamics of psychologies East and West. The hope is that, combined, they can create a wholeness that encompasses the various levels of human experience. Since many of these articles were written for specialist readers, they won't have the verve and inspiration of Welwood's other books, but Welwood fans and enthusiasts of transpersonal psychology will be delighted to have all these ground-breaking articles together in one place. So go ahead and reach for the stars--just don't forget that you still have to slog through the mire with the rest of us. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Can the meditative traditions of Buddhism be integrated with the practice of Western psychology? John Welwood's latest book addresses this question with new comprehensiveness and depth, building on the innovative psychospiritual approach of his six previous books (with total sales of over 300,000 copies). The questions he addresses include: <br>What can the spiritual methodologies of the East teach us about psychological health? <br>What issues arise when the recognition of our larger nature challenges our very conception of individual self ? <br>What new directions become possible when psychological work is undertaken in a spiritual context? <br>How does Western psychological understanding affect our approach to spirituality? <br>Welwood's psychology of awakening brings together three major dimensions of human existence: personal, interpersonal, and suprapersonal in one overall framework of understanding and practice. <br>The book's first section addresses basic questions about the relationship between psychology and contemplative spirituality. The second explores the practical implications of this convergence for psychological health and healing. The third considers the implications for relationship and community.</p><h2>Ready for Anything: 52 Productivity Principles for Getting Things Done</h2><p>In his bestselling first book, <b>Getting Things Done</b>, veteran coach and management consultant David Allen presented his breakthrough methods to increase efficiency.

The fact that we have 8efforte at all, though, implies that we confront resistance and impediments when we want to get anything done. Improving productivity has a lot to do with dealing more effectively with the hindrances, barriers, and distractions that show up in our way=anything that opposes or weakens our forward motion. In a totally frictionless world, everything would just appear as soon as it was imagined=there would be little need to train for greater flexibility and focus or to install better systems and approaches. In the world you and I inhabit, however, to really get what we want most effectively, we have to be ready for anything. And there <i>are</i> things we can all do, anytime, that make it easier to take things in stride and stay the course.<p> Ifve spent more than two decades exploring the best methods to achieve a more relaxed, positive, and sustainable way to live and work. And as a management consultant and productivity coach, Ifve helped thousands of professionals implement what Ifve discovered to be the best ways to work more productively <i>and</i> get more enjoyment from what theyfre doing. When people gain a method of achieving that kind of balance in their day-to-day endeavors, no matter whatfs going on, they have easier access to more of their intuition and creativity. They become better at processing information, managing their thoughts and feelings, focusing on results, and trusting their judgments about what to do next. They have a <i>systematic approach</i> in place for dealing with themselves and their work, which is far more useful than merely relying on ad hoc, reactive behaviors to bail them out of the pressures and crises of their world. When people know they have a process in place to handle any situation, they are more relaxed. When theyfre relaxed, everything improves. More gets done, with less effort, and a host of other wonderful side effects emerge that add to the outcomes of their efforts and the quality of their life.</p><p> The methods I teach came from the behaviors and the systems I discovered that worked the best to keep us at our best. Since the early 1980s, they have been tested and proven highly effective, from the ground up=for both individuals and organizations. The steps of this discovery and this process were described in my first book, <i>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</i>. Its success around the world indicated that people across a wide spectrum of cultures and careers seemed ready for this information and eager for change. They were tired of feeling overwhelmed by their jobs and the business of life. They wanted to regain lost opportunities for creative thinking and playing. They were looking for a new approach, a <i>system</i> that could be counted on, no matter what kind of job they had or what kind of day they were having. They wanted a structure=but a natural one that matched their complex lifestyles and created more freedom, not more constraint.</p><p> While I was uncovering and implementing the details of the what, when, and how that made up the heart of my programs, I started doing something else: I began writing about the <i>why</i> behind these steps. Why did they work so well? Why did they consistently help people function at a higher capacity and feel better? Was something deeper at work here? What was the foundation behind this success? There seemed to be underlying principles that wove themselves in and through the methodology=factors that held true no matter when, where, or with whom they were applied.</p><p> A person can be an excellent race-car driver without knowing anything about gravity, even though gravity is the underlying force affecting everything one does behind the wheel. To win races, the driver needs only to master the steering, the speed on the straightaways, and the technique of the turns, and to remember to keep the car under control at all times. You do your job, and gravity will do its job. Manage yourself, and the automobile will be fine. But what if driving fast isnft enough after a while? What if you want to know more about why your skills work so well and how they keep you from crashing and burning? What if you want to get closer to the secrets behind your own successes? And what if understanding those secrets leads to more tools for productivity and even greater achievements?</p><p> In 1997, I began exploring these questions by compiling a set of principles that seemed to lie at the foundation of productive behavior and writing informal essays about the implications and applications of those truths in everyday life. I started to enlarge on my core premise that onefs ability to be productive was directly proportional to onefs ability to relax. I dug further into four main areas of productive behavior:<br><br> 1.Capturing and corralling all our internal and external 8open loopse to regain clarity and energy.<br> 2.Consciously managing our focus within the multiple levels of outcomes and responsibilities to which we are committed.<br> 3.Creating trusted structures and consistent usage of them to trigger the appropriate focus and reminders as necessary.<br> 4.Grounding it all with flexible, forward motion at the physical-action level.<br><br> I discovered that people didnft need more discipline as such=they needed a disciplined approach. They didnft need to work harder=they needed to define their work better at multiple levels of detail and stay focused on all of them simultaneously.</p><p> Behind all this lay the 8mind like watere concept, an image Ifd come across years ago while studying karate. When you throw a pebble into a pond, what does the water do? It responds with total appropriateness to the force and mass of the rock. It does nothing more and nothing less. It doesnft overreact or underreact. It doesnft react at all. It simply interacts with whatever comes to it and then returns to its natural state. The water can do that only by design. A human being can act this way only if he or she has a conscious system in place and if that system is built on principles that can withstand chaos and stress. Those principles must be aligned with something deeper in our nature.</p><p> Two years after I began writing the essays, I decided to write and distribute a newsletter to those who were becoming familiar with my methods. My hope was to galvanize a network of practitioners and to build a community of people dedicated to doing good work, sharing their best practices, and celebrating life. Each newsletter was intended to reinforce and expand the ideas behind relaxed control and performance excellence. I wondered if people would respond.</p><p> My answer soon exceeded my expectations. Within two years, our readership had grown tenfold, from two thousand to twenty thousand subscribers. A year later it had reached thirty thousand and was still gathering momentum. People were sending out the newsletters through their own online networks. They were being e-mailed across the country and around the globe. Other folks were printing, stapling, and binding hard copies and distributing them to their friends and colleagues. Still others were posting them in elevators at work. They were showing up everywhere. Some of the essays leaned more toward practical advice, and others delved below the surface. All were developing and growing my understanding of the 8why,e and all were adding value to what had come before.</p><p> The feedback was overwhelmingly positive=people seemed hungry for reinforcement of the basics, exploration of the subtleties, and the adventure of the surprises produced by some of the simplest techniques, tools, and awarenesses. These were hardly people in the Remedial Living class either=the most profound rewards from using this material have been reported by some of the best and brightest people on the planet, many already in the top percentiles of productivity, by anyonefs standards.</p><p> It was time to put this material together into a book of its own.</p><p> The following principles, commentaries, and essays form a body of thought that I believe offers more than just tips or tricks. Whether or not people implemented the complete method of best practices I delineated in <i>Getting Things Done</i>, there were still things everyone could do more and more consistently, anytime, that would improve their productivity and well-being. These are the elements you will find validated and reinforced in these principles and essays.</p><p> The writings have been sorted into the four major areas of productive behavior they support: completion, focus, structure, and action. The principles and essays grouped as such are meant not to be limited to these headings or to give an exhaustive exposition of those topics but rather to stimulate your own thinking and validations of better ways to handle things.</p><p> There are times when individuals (and groups) will get the most leverage out of completing old stuff and clearing the decks (Part I). Other times a focus on the right focus is the primary key (Part II). Still other situations will call for structures and systems as most important for growth (Part III). And others will require simply letting go of trying to get it perfect and just get going (Part IV). All these aspects are important, but often one specifically will be the trigger point for busting through into a next level of productivity. Part V offers checklists as reference and reminders of the core practices for staying on top of the flow.</p><p> You will notice that the essays are not precise expositions of the principles they follow but rather food-for-thought spins on the topics.* And the concluding 8By the way...e questions are merely catalysts for your own reflection about possible applications 8back at the ranch.e Human behavior and awareness can be at the same time really simple, really complex, and infinitely explorable, and Ifve tried not to nail down anything too hard. But youfll find at least hints as to how work functions at higher levels, how we function, and how the world functions. As you digest and put these principles into practice, there is a good chance you will contribute more to your job and to your life as a whole. Reading them will likely reinforce subtle changes in your perceptions, which lead to changes in behavior. A change in behavior leads to a change in action <i>and</i> in results. Things spiral outward in larger and larger ways. Change occurs, and a positive shift happens. Itfs most often the small things, done consistently in strategic places, that make the most difference.</p><p> As I said, you probably donft need to work harder. You also may not feel you have to institute the step-by-step system with all the parts and processes that <i>Getting Things Done</i> provided. But at times you still may need to manage incompletions better, be more creative and expansive, be more focused in your thinking, access your intuition, have better structures, be more flexible and relaxed, or just get moving on next steps. Any or all of the above will make you more productive. This book provides important perspectives in all of those areas and may have just the key you need to kick-start yourself into rewarding new levels of expression.</p><p> You will probably find something familiar about this material. Not that youfve read it anywhere else, but that you will recognize it as something you already know, intuitively. To gain value from this content does not require new skills or learning a complex body of new information. This writing will likely validate much of what you already know and do that works. But it will also challenge you to apply that awareness in a much more conscious and consistent manner=and thatfs where the real power lies. This is a compilation of effective perspectives and behaviors, applicable anywhere, anytime. Though each has merit by itself, as a whole they will provide a rich contextual experience greater than the sum of its parts. Whether you approach it ad hoc or straight through, I invite you to allow the bigger picture of a dynamic, positive readiness for life to emerge as you turn the pages.</p><p> I continue to be surprised with the seemingly infinite ways the principles of personal effectiveness can be examined and experienced. Our journeys always return to the same basic truths, but our explorations lead us back to those awarenesses in new and more profound ways. The thinking captured in this book will no doubt open more doorways and lead to further discoveries. One layer of meaning will give way to another and then another and another. The spiral will continue to expand. Itfs as interesting and inspiring to me to think about whatfs not yet in this book as of what is. I hope you will find it, as I have, a doorway instead of a final act.</p><p> The 8ready statee of the martial artist is not a passive, reactive, or finite one. It is totally dynamic, alive, creative, and expansive. But itfs not free. It is enabled by increasingly refined training and experience with work and life. May these principles serve as road signs and guideposts along your way.</p><p> <i>*These principles are numbered sequentially for this book, not as they were in the newsletters (the initial numberings were arbitrary, as well). Also, some essays have been paired with different principles than those they were matched with originally.</i> <br><br> <b>1.</b><br><br> <b>Cleaning up creates new directions.</b><br> Completion of open loops, whether they be major projects or boxes of old stuff wefve yet to purge and organize, prepares the ground for cleaner, clearer, and more complete energy for whatever shows up. Wefre often not sure whatfs next or what to tackle. At that point, just clean or complete something=something obvious and in front of you, right away. Soon youfll have the energy and clarity to know whatfs next, and youfll have cleared the decks for more effective responsiveness on every front. Process your in-basket, purge your e-mails, or clean your center desk drawer. Youfve got to do it sometime anyway.<br><br> <b>Prepared for the Unknown?</b><br> SOMETHING IS COMING=probably within a few days=thatfs going to change your world. You donft see it yet. You donft know what itfs about. But itfs there, rolling inexorably forward, destined to throw you a curve that you do not expect. It could show up sooner or later=but it <i>will</i> show up. Trust me.</p><p> Write down these words exactly four weeks from today on your calendar: 8David Allen said a month ago that something was coming I couldnft foresee that would affect me significantly.e Prove me wrong. </p><p> Are you ready? Is that unexpected event or input going to add insult to injury by making you feel more out of control? Or are you going to see it as the next creative opportunity that takes you to a new level of expression and contribution? How are you preparing for the surprises that the new experience will invariably throw your way? </p><p> I think there are basically two levels to handle for any unforeseen opportunity: <br> 1.The spiritual. If God is all, and youfre part of that, just relax.<br> 2.All the rest. For this you must get your act together, so you can shift gears as required.<br><br> An old Asian proverb says, 8The more you sweat in pea...</p></p><h2>NIV Journalling Bible In One Year</h2><p>The NIV Bible In One Year is a popular daily Bible reading programme which makes it simple to read through the whole Bible in 365 days.

The children usually begin talking about a past life at the age of two or three and may talk about a previous family or the way they died in a previous life. Their statements have often been found to be accurate for one particular deceased individual, and some children have recognized members of the previous family. A number have also had birthmarks or defects that matched wounds on the body of the deceased person. </p><p><i>Life Before Life</i> presents the cases in a straightforward way and explores the possibility that consciousness may continue after the brain dies. It is a provocative and fascinating book that can challenge and ultimately change readers' understandings about life and death.</p></p><p>JIM B.

His great-grandfather signed the Declaration and his grandfather, William Henry Harrison, was the ninth president of the United States. Harrison, a leading Indiana lawyer, became a Republican Party champion, even taking a leave from the Civil War to campaign for Lincoln. After a scandal-free term in the Senate-no small feat in the Gilded Age-the Republicans chose Harrison as their presidential candidate in 1888. Despite losing the popular vote, he trounced the incumbent, Grover Cleveland, in the electoral college. </p><p>In contrast to standard histories, which dismiss Harrison's presidency as corrupt and inactive, Charles W. Calhoun sweeps away the stereotypes of the age to reveal the accomplishments of our twenty-third president. With Congress under Republican control, he exemplified the activist president, working feverishly to put the Party's planks into law and approving the first billion-dollar peacetime budget. But the Democrats won Congress in 1890, stalling his legislative agenda, and with the First Lady ill, his race for reelection proceeded quietly. (She died just before the election.) In the end, Harrison could not beat Cleveland in their unprecedented rematch.</p><p>With dazzling attention to this president's life and the social tapestry of his times, Calhoun compellingly reconsiders Harrison's legacy.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles W. Calhoun</b> is a professor of history at East Carolina University. A former National Endowment for the Humanities fellow, Calhoun is the author or editor of four books, including <i>The Gilded Age</i>, and a member of the editorial board of the<i> Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era</i>. He lives in Greenville, North Carolina.</p>Calhoun dusts off an almost thoroughly forgotten chief executive, known primarily for serving between Cleveland's two terms, to disclose a harbinger of the modern, activist president. Although born in his grandfather's house--and Grandfather was William Henry Harrison, the president famed for dying one month after inauguration--Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901) wasn't to the manor born. He had to establish himself as an attorney before marrying, and become a hardworking high earner before his political ambitions bore fruit. He lost more elections than he won before his 1888 presidential victory; even then, he lost the popular vote because of huge Democrat majorities in the South. He passed more legislation, spent more money, and did more hands-on diplomacy than had any previous president. His single great failure was his legislation ensuring the voting rights of southern blacks. Democrats successfully stalled the bill in the Fifty-first Congress, and after they regained Congress in 1890 and the White House in 1892, the issue was dead until the 1960s.

Officials immediately quarantined the town, but the only cure for the community of more than 1,400 people was antitoxin serum and the nearest supply was in Anchorage-hundreds of miles of snowbound wilderness away. The only way to get it to Nome was by dogsled.</p><p>Twenty teams braved subzero temperatures and blizzard conditions to run over 600 miles in six days in a desperate relay race that saved the people of Nome. Several of the dogs, including Togo and Balto, became national heroes. Today their efforts, and those of the courageous mushers, are commemorated every March by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. </p><p>Jon Van Zyle's stunning oil paintings capture the brutal conditions, pristine wilderness, and sheer guts and determination demonstrated by the heroic mushers and dogs.</p></p><p><p><b>Debbie S.

Miller on seven books for children.</p>Grade 3-6-Hot on the heels of Robert J. Blake's Togo (Philomel, 2002) comes another version of the story of the relay race across Alaska to save the people of Nome from an outbreak of diphtheria in 1925. While Blake focuses on one particular dog, Miller tells the more complete tale, beginning with the first dying children and including all of the details of carrying the serum from Anchorage, 1000 miles from its destination. The conditions were terrible as dog teams and mushers dealt with all sorts of problems caused by temperatures as low as 64 degrees below zero. Much of the story focuses on Leonhard Seppala, the musher who owned Togo, Balto, and many other sled dogs. Included are a list of the mushers who participated in the relay, additional information on the dogs that ran, brief information on the Iditarod, a trail map, and photographs of Seppala and Togo. Van Zyle, official artist of the Iditarod and a musher himself, has created vivid, full-spread paintings to bring the story to life. This book does not have the intensity of storytelling or art that is found in Togo, but for children whose interest is piqued by Blake's book, or for older readers, this is an excellent account told with lots of detail and drama.<br><i>Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tale of Murasaki: A Novel</h2><p><b>The Tale of Murasaki</b> is an elegant and brilliantly authentic historical novel by the author of <b>Geisha</b> and the only Westerner ever to have become a geisha.<br><br>In the eleventh century Murasaki Shikibu wrote the world&#x2019;s first novel, <b>The Tale of Genji</b>, the most popular work in the history of Japanese literature. In <b>The Tale of Murasaki</b><i>, </i>Liza Dalby has created a breathtaking fictionalized narrative of the life of this timeless poet&#x2013;a lonely girl who becomes such a compelling storyteller that she is invited to regale the empress with her tales. <b>The Tale of Murasaki</b><i> </i>is the story of an enchanting time and an exotic place. Whether writing about mystical rice fields in the rainy mountains or the politics and intrigue of the royal court, Dalby breathes astonishing life into ancient Japan.</p><p>Liza Dalby's novel is a brilliantly imagined chronicle of the 11th-century Japanese writer Murasaki Shikibu. As we soon discover, our narrator has a good many doubts about the writing life. "As I pondered this question of how to be a success at court," she muses, "I came to the conclusion that literary ambition was more likely than not to bring a woman to a bad end." Happily, the real-life Murasaki persisted, and went on to become the author of the world's first novel, <i>The Tale of Genji</i>. For <i>The Tale of Murasaki</i>, Dalby draws on this groundbreaking masterpiece and on the surviving fragments of Murasaki's own diary and poetry, along with another masterpiece of the Heian period, <i>The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon</i>. The result is a vivid and emotionally detailed portrait of an intelligent, sensitive, and complex woman.<p> In Dalby's novel, Murasaki writes her first stories about Prince Genji's amorous encounters in order to entertain her friends, and to express her own creative temperament. As the stories gain a wider public, however, they are transformed into a conduit for observations on the mores and intrigues of court life. And in the end, as the narrator struggles to stay true to her literary vision, her tales are inflected by Buddhist thought and become parables on the transience and beauty of the world: </p><blockquote> I have always felt compelled to set down a vision of things I have heard and seen. Life itself has never been enough. It only became real for me when I fashioned it into stories. Yet, somehow, despite all I've written, the true nature of things I've tried to grasp in my fiction still manages to drift through the words and sit, like little piles of dust, between the lines. </blockquote> Dalby is an anthropologist by trade, who has produced two previous nonfiction studies: <i>Kimono</i> and <i>Geisha</i>. And given that her research for <i>Geisha</i> gained her the distinction of being the only Westerner ever to have trained in that much misunderstood profession, it's no surprise that she is able to reconstruct 11th-century Japan with meticulous fidelity. It's all there--the political and sexual machinations, the preoccupations with clothing and custom, the difficult and tenuous position of courtiers, the intensity of female friendships in a male-dominated society--and the author shows us precisely how Murasaki's sensibilities were shaped by the culture in which she lived. This is a rich and convincing debut, and another chapter in the current resurrection of the historical novel. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i>&#x201c;Luscious, lush and languorously elegant....

Yet there are those who will not allow the past to remain buried. A scholar digging in the plains stumbles across an ancient sealed vault. The merchant Humble Measure schemes to drive out the remaining Malazan invaders. And the surviving agents of a long-lost power are stirring, for they sense change and so, opportunity.

Nearly two years before, its original inhabitants had drowned without warning in tidal waves that inundated it when the last fragments of the titanic floating mountain named Moon's Spawn crashed into the Rivan Sea. Then, when the flood waters receded, a motley army of treasure-hunters, scavengers and looters had descended upon its corpse like a swarm of flies, and soon after that came an even worse plague: the thieves, conmen and other swindlers who preyed upon them.Representatives of the Southern Confederation of Free Cities were the first to arrive at the scene of devastation. Wreckers and pirates from way back, they salvaged everything they could, namely the surviving boats of the region, and established a concession out to the newly born isles. A few months later transport fees and tariffs were settled upon and four separate armed challenges to their monopoly had been successfully put down.Now, after more than a year of trade, the Southern Confederation had firmly established itself as the sole representative of the islands, which they named, with characteristic directness, the Spawns.&nbsp;<br>Jallin, nicknamed the Jumper for his habit of ambushing from the rear, had to admit that the good times in Hurly were officially over. He and all the other hustlers and scavengers could feel the pinch of lean times. The one-time flood of fortune-hunters had thinned toa trickle of ragged men and women no better off than those who'd already clawed out a spot in the festering town.Jallin the Jumper knew this well. He'd seen the cycle play itself out in town after town up north, where the Malazan wars had fuelled the rabid, cannibalistic economies of scarcity and demand. He sensed that here the frenzy of fortunes won overnight and even more quickly lost would never reach the pitch it had seasons ago. And it was ending before he'd made his big strike. Just as it had at Pale, Kurl and Callows. Only this time he wouldn't let that happen. Couldn't. Because Hurly was the end of the road. As far south as all these losers and dregs could slide. Everyone's last chance.So he paid close attention when yet another new arrival came tramping down the town's muddy main track. The newcomer was a wiry ragged veteran, a foreigner by his ruddy hair and ginger moustache - a Malazan. He wore army-standard sandals and cloak, and carried battered leather panniers over one shoulder. That the man was a veteran didn't worry Jallin; almost all the loser fortune-hunters who came down that road had once marched in any number of armies up north - and usually deserted from every damned one. To him they were pathetic in their willingness to get maimed or killed for the promise of a handful of coin or a scratch of land.This one appeared to have fared even worse than most. A single shortsword hung at his side, but other than that all he carried was the panniers slung over a shoulder and kept tightly gripped in one scarred and sun-browned hand. Those wide bags interested Jallin. What, he wondered, would an old soldier, cashiered or deserted, think vital enough to drag with him all the way down here to the Spawns?The veteran stopped where so many of the other hopeful Spawn-looters had halted: where the cart-track ended at the strand of slate-black gravel that sloped down to the Rivan Sea. Here, the observant among them usually noticed two important things: that the Spawn Isles were those distant faint dots far out to sea, and that there wasn't a single boat in sight.These discoveries often left even the hardiest and most resilient feeling lost, and so here was where Jallin preferred to approach his targets. As he came alongside, the fellow was still squinting out to sea, and so he murmured: 'There they are, hey? Pay-dirt.'The old guy grunted something, eyed the wreckage-strewn gravel beach. 'I'm lookin' for a boat.'Jallin smiled. 'Isn't everyone here, friend? And it just so happens I know a man who might have room for one more on his.'That got a look. He could tell from the man's blunt gaze that he'd seen a lot. Most veterans had an odd hard stare that Jallin couldn't quite understand - himself not having ever been stupid enough to set foot on a battlefield. It could make a man think twice about giving them trouble. But despite this he'd gone ahead and robbed, cheated, rolled, and even murdered some. All from behind, or from a position of trust, of course. Which was why he considered their toughness and fighting skills irrelevant. After all, peacetime was a very different sort of war.'How much?' the fellow asked. He relaxed his grip to shade his eyes against the western sun. Whatever was in those bags, it looked heavy. Jallin wet his lips then gave his friendliest chuckle.'How much? Oh, it'll cost. I won't insult you by pretending I can get you some kinda special deal or some such shit. It'll cost. <i>That</i> we got to negotiate, right?'Another neutral grunt. Jallin pointed back up the track to where it cut between slapped-up inns, stores and taprooms. 'The Island Inn maybe, hey? What d'you say? You look like you could use a drink.'The fellow turned, squinted up the track, even chewed at an edge of his moustache. After one last lingering stare out to sea, his tensed shoulders fell and he sighed. 'Yeah. Could use a drink.'Jallin showed the way. He kept up a constant distracting chatter about all the adventurers he knew who'd struck it rich out at the Spawns - which in truth was no one. None who had ever returned, that is. All the while he was thinking: we'll settle a price for tonight, not too low, not too high. Nothing to arouse suspicion. Then down at the beach he'd introduce him to his 'friend'. All the razor-sharp pointed length of it. His misericorde - the weapon he used to put old soldiers where they belonged: out of their misery.&nbsp;<br>The Island Inn was unique among Hurly's new buildings in that it possessed stone walls. It occupied all that remained of a temple to Poliel, goddess of disease, pestilence and plague. It seemed the old population of Hurly had been particularly anxious to appease her. Perhaps it had to do with all the neighbouring marshes. The new owner of the structure, Akien Threw, liked to joke that they would've been far better off appeasing the cult of Elder Dark, of which the Moon's Spawn had been a holy artefact.As Jallin entered, guiding the old soldier to a table in the rear,he caught Akien's eye. All the town's touts and hustlers had an understanding with the man: a meal and a floor to flop on in exchange for heading clients his way. Plus a percentage of any take, of course.Two tall tankards of beer arrived almost the instant they rested their arms on the tabletop of silvery-grey driftwood slats. The veteran's eyes narrowed and his mouth turned down. 'What's this?'In the relative darkness of the inn Jallin was struck by the scars that lined the fellow's face and how his mangy ginger hair, grey in places, grew patchily one side as if over burns. But he'd seen old soldiers before and almost all carried scars. They all parted with what little coin they'd gathered over the years as easily as anyone, and more swiftly than most. 'So what's your name then, friend?'After a time the man growled, 'Red. Red Dog.'Jallin raised a brow at that but said nothing: he didn't give a damn what the fellow's name was. 'Well, Red, this is Elingarth ale. The good stuff.' He touched a finger to the side of his nose. 'The owner's a friend of mine.''I'll bet he is,' the soldier muttered darkly. But he lifted the tankard and took a long pull. Jallin noted the nest of white scar ridges up and down the man's forearm. He decided he'd be a touch worried if the fellow wasn't obviously so far past his prime. He also noted how the fellow kept a tight grip on the panniers on his lap.The veteran wiped his mouth and grimaced his distaste. 'I doubt that's from Elingarth.'Jallin gave an easy shrug. 'I wouldn't know. Another?''Abyss, no.''Sure. It's early yet.'In keeping with the diminishing flow of treasure-hunters, the inn's common room was deserted. A pair of guards, no more than old-hand hustlers like Jallin, sat by the door. Two men sat hunched almost head to head at a table nearby, both staring sullenly out into the day's last slanting yellow rays. One elegantly dressed young man, a scion of some aristocratic family or other, commanded another table. He was with three others, all of whom Jallin knew as local thugs and would-be guides, like himself.The young man leaned back suddenly and announced: 'Then there's no sense heading out. It's too late by far. The place has been picked clean by now.'The old soldier, Red, turned to watch him.One of the local guides said something to which the noblemananswered, dismissively, 'Well, who's come back recently? Has anyone? 'Another of the companions offered, 'If I found anything out there I sure as death wouldn't come back <i>here</i>.' They all had a good laugh at that, except the noble youth.Jallin leaned forward, murmured, 'That's all just sour talk. He's afraid to head out.''So,' the veteran drawled, 'where are all the ships?'Two more tankards arrived care of a shuffling serving boy. 'Anchored off shore. Launches put in at dawn and you buy your berth. But,' he added, lowering his voice, 'it's possible to slip out past them at night. For a fee.'The soldier nodded his understanding. 'At dawn, when the boats put in. Why doesn't everyone just rush 'em?''Southern Free Citi...</p><h2>The Rustlers of West Fork</h2><p><b>In this first of four classic frontier novels, Louis L'Amour adds his own special brand to the life and adventures of one of America's favorite fictional cowboys, Hopalong Cassidy. </b><br><br>In <i>The Rustlers of West Fork,</i> the quick-thinking, fast-shooting cowpuncher heads west to deliver a fortune in bank notes to his old friend, Dick Jordan. When he arrives at the Circle J, he discovers that the rancher and his daughter, Pam, are being held prisoner by a desperate band of outlaws led by the ruthless Avery Sparr and his partner Arnold Soper. Even if Hopalong Cassidy can free Jordan and Pam, he will have to lead them across rough and untamed Apache country, stalked by the outlaws who have vowed to gun him down. But Hopalong is no stranger to trouble, and before his guns or his temper cool, he's determines to round up Sparr and his gang and bring the outlaws to justice ... dead or alive! This classic tale of pursuit and survival is vintage L'Amour and adds new life and luster to the legend of Hopalong Cassidy.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> SIX-GUN SALVAGE<br> &nbsp;<br> Hopalong Cassidy watched the old banker count the money with careful fingers. Fifteen thousand dollars was an amount to be handled with reverence and respect. As he watched the mounting stack of bills, Hopalong saw them less as the long green bills they were than as the cattle they represented&#x2014;the cattle and the work. Into that stack of bills was going money that had grown from days of cold wind and rain, nights of thunder and lightning, of restless herds poised for stampede, of rivers and washes running brim full with roaring flood waters, of dust, blistering sun, and the roar of rustlers&#x2019; guns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Into that pile so flat and green went more than money. Into that pile went months of brutal labor, the brindle steer that had killed a horse under him down in Lonetree Canyon, and the old mossyhorn who had fouled Lanky&#x2019;s rope on a juniper, putting him three weeks in bed with a broken leg. And into that pile went the kid from Toyah, who had ridden up to join them so full of vitality and exuberance, only to have his horse step into a prairie-dog hole while running ahead of a stampede. They had buried what was left of the kid and sent his hat and gun to a brother in El Paso.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There she is, Hoppy,&#x201d; the banker said at last. &#x201c;Buck will be mighty glad to get shut of that debt, I know. He&#x2019;s a man who takes bein&#x2019; in debt harder&#x2019;n any man I can think of, an&#x2019; he&#x2019;s sure scrimped an&#x2019; cut corners to have that much in three years!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Cassidy agreed, &#x201c;Buck&#x2019;s right conscientious about most things. He don&#x2019;t like to get into debt in the first place, but you know how it was with Dick Jordan. When he fell heir to that ranch out West he sold his cattle an&#x2019; remuda to Buck, knowin&#x2019; if there was one man around he could trust to pay ever&#x2019; last red cent it was Buck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Came at a good time too. Buck had been talkin&#x2019; about more cattle, an&#x2019; with the additional range he could use, it would be a positive shame not to have &#x2019;em. Otherwise, he never would have gone into debt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You takin&#x2019; this money West yourself?&#x201d; The banker&#x2019;s shrewd old eyes studied the silver head. &#x201c;I know Buck can&#x2019;t afford to be away right now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m takin&#x2019; it West, an&#x2019; glad of the chance. Old Dick was a friend of mine, too, an&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve heard a sight about that ranch o&#x2019; his. Rightly, it belonged to his wife. It was part of an old Spanish grant, you know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Uh-huh. Helped draw up some o&#x2019; the papers. Got a daughter now, I hear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Had her a long time. Shucks, she was fourteen or fifteen before they left here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Say&#x201d;&#x2014;the banker turned around in his chair&#x2014;&#x201c;who&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; out there with you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019; alone. Mesquite&#x2019;s off somewheres, as usual, an&#x2019; Buck can&#x2019;t spare two men. Anyway, it ain&#x2019;t a two-man job.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe. Things out thataway are pretty lively. Had a letter from a friend of mine out to McClellan. Had his bank held up about three weeks ago, killed his cashier, wounded a deputy sheriff, then lost the durned posse.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lost &#x2019;em?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Uh-huh, just plain lost &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hopalong slid off the desk and gathered up the money. &#x201c;Well, Buck will be waitin&#x2019; for me, so I&#x2019;d better get into the leather an&#x2019; ride to the ranch. But don&#x2019;t you worry about this money. I&#x2019;ll see it gets to Dick, as promised.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tucking the packages of bills into his black shirt and drawing his belt tighter, he hitched his guns into an easier position on his dark-trousered hips and started for the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> The banker arose from his chair and walked to the window where he could watch Cassidy cross the street. The same trim bowed legs, the broad, sloping shoulders, the lean waist and choppy walk of the horseman. His silver guns were worn by much handling, and his boots were cracked and dusty. Suddenly the banker found himself wishing he was younger and starting West with Hopalong on that ride.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he started to turn from the window a movement caught his eye, and he hesitated. A man had stepped out from beside the bank and started slowly across the street in Hopalong&#x2019;s wake. If that man had been standing alongside the bank, he might have seen Hopalong take the money, for there was an office window near the desk. The banker frowned. His wife would be waiting supper, and if he got into the saloon he might not get out for hours....&nbsp;Anyway, Hopalong could take care of himself. He always had.<br> &nbsp;<br> Trouble followed Hopalong Cassidy like wolves follow a snow-driven herd, but few men were more fitted to cope with it than the silver-haired gunfighter. He should have told Hoppy to ook up Monaghan, at the bank in McClellan. Well, he could write to him. Maybe Hoppy would have business over that way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dusk was softening the line of the buildings when Hopalong crossed the street to the saloon. A poker game was in session when he pushed through the batwing doors, but the players carefully avoided his eyes. They knew each other, and knew the game was fairly even all around. But Hopalong was a specialist at draw. His brand of poker was apt to be expensive for them, and they wanted none of that.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three men lounged at the bar, all strangers. One of them, Hoppy remembered, had passed him on the step. His casual glance read their brands with a quick, easy eye, and he grinned to himself. Drifting punchers, maybe a shade on the owl-hoot side.<br> &nbsp;<br> Trail dust lay thick on their clothes, but their guns had been wiped clean, and the cartridges in their belts shone brightly. One man&#x2014;who had passed him on the walk before the saloon&#x2014;was a slender young fellow with straight, clean-cut features and a deep line at one corner of his mouth. When he glanced toward Cassidy, Hopalong saw that one eye was half closed by a lowered lid. At first the man seemed to be winking, and then Hoppy realized the affliction was permanent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The other two also had the look of hard cases. The tall man was round-shouldered and his face carried deep-set lines of cruelty and harshness. The third stranger was scarcely more than a boy, but one already far gone down the hard trails by the look of him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drifters were not uncommon, and the range life was not one calculated to make men soft. Such men as these came in and drifted on each morning and night, for Twin Rivers was on a trail much traveled in these months.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pullin&#x2019; out tomorrow, Hoppy?&#x201d; The bartender leaned his arms on the bar. &#x201c;Johnny was sayin&#x2019; you were headed West to visit Dick Jordan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At the name all three strangers turned sharply to stare at Hopalong. Their expressions excited his interest and also their apparent familiarity with the name of Dick Jordan. Only a familiar name could have turned them so sharply. They looked away, and the man with the squint eye spoke to the others in a low, careful voice, as though explaining something.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Cassidy, &#x201c;we bought his herd three years ago. Buck wants me to ride out there, and that country always did appeal to me. It will be good to get shut of this dust and fill my lungs with that good mountain air again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dick bought hisself a good ranch, I hear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t buy it. His wife was Spanish an&#x2019; the ranch was part of an old land grant belonging to her family. She inherited it, so they just moved out there. They took their daughter with them. She was maybe fifteen years old. Nice kid, but all knees and freckles.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the strangers snickered, and Cassidy glanced at them appraisingly. Two of them avoided his eyes, but the one with the bad eyelid met his glance boldly. &#x201c;Heerd what y&#x2019; said about ridin&#x2019; to see Dick Jordan,&#x201d; he commented dryly, &#x201c;an&#x2019; if I was you, I&#x2019;d forget it. That there&#x2019;s a tough country for drifters. They don&#x2019;t cotton to &#x2019;em, not none a-tall!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That right?&#x201d; Hopalong said carelessly. &#x201c;Well, maybe I can help them get used to it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The tall man answered him, and his eyes were hard as he looked at Cassidy. &#x201c;You go out there huntin&#x2019; him,&#x201d; he said insolently, &#x201c;an&#x2019; you&#x2019;re sure likely to find him! You&#x2019;re liable to go right where he is!&#x201d; As he finished speaking he put down his glass and all three walked out of the saloon.

He's going to climb the highest mountain of Discworld and meet the gods.</p><p>It's time the Last Hero in the world returns what the first hero stole. Trouble is, that'll mean the end of the world, if no one stops him in time.</p></p><p>A new Discworld story is always an event. Terry Pratchett's <i>The Last Hero</i> is unusually short, a 40,000-word "Discworld Fable" rather than a full novel, but is illustrated throughout in sumptuous color by Paul Kidby.<p> The 160 pages cover the series' longest and most awesome (but still comic) journey yet, a mission to save all Discworld from a new threat. An old threat, actually. Aged warrior Cohen the Barbarian has decided to go out with a bang and take the gods with him. So, with the remnants of his geriatric Silver Horde, he's climbing to the divine retirement home Dunmanifestin with the Discworld equivalent of a nuke--a fifty-pound keg of Agatean Thunder Clay.</p><p> This will, for excellent magical reasons, destroy the world.</p><p> It's up to Leonard of Quirm, Discworld's da Vinci, to invent the technology that might just beat Cohen to his goal. His unlikely vessel is powered by dragons, crewed by himself and two popular regular characters, and secretly harbors a stowaway. Before long we hear the Discworld version of "Houston, we have a problem...."</p><p> Kidby rises splendidly to the challenge of painting both funny faces and cosmic vistas. As Pratchett puts it, <i>The Last Hero</i> "has an extra dimension: some parts of it are written in paint!" New characters include Evil Dark Lord Harry Dread, who started out with "just two lads and his Shed of Doom," and a god so tiresome that his worshippers are forbidden chocolate, ginger, mushrooms <i>and</i> garlic.</p><p> Pratchett's story alone is strong and effective, with several hair-raising <i>frissons</i> contrasting with high comedy; Kidby's paintings make it something very special. Not to be missed. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series.

Farther down the list: The Band, Samuel Barber, Cecelia Bartoli, Count Basie, and Afropop star Waldemer Bastos.<br><br> Each entry is passionately written, with expert listening notes, fascinating anecdotes, and the occasional perfect quote&#x2014;"Your collection could be filled with nothing but music from Ray Charles," said Tom Waits, "and you'd have a completely balanced diet." Every entry identifies key tracks, additional works by the artist, and where to go next.

He loved all God&#x2019;s creatures and called them his sisters and brothers. His name was Francis.<br><br>In this beautifully illustrated and sensitively written book, Brian Wildsmith tells the story of Saint Francis.

This elegant, over-sized picture book is sure to be treasured by the entire family.</p><p>Brian Wildsmith was brought up in the mining village of Penistone, near Sheffield, England, and he attended the Slade School of Fine Art. Upon completing his studies, Brian made use of his love of music and skill as a pianist in the National Service, teaching music at the Royal School of Music. He became an art teacher after the National Service but soon gave up teaching to fulfill his true ambition, painting.PreSchool-Grade 3-Highlights of the gentle saint's life are told in a simple, straightforward first-person narrative, and the celestial glories of his spirituality are reflected in the lavish, panoramic ink-and-watercolor double-page spreads. Framed in gold, they gleam with brilliant colors and are filled with action and detail. Francis is almost a minor figure amid the sweeping landscapes, monumental 13th-century architecture, and splendidly dressed medieval people, all depicted with precise delicacy. Clouds of birds hover, hop, and perch. A multicolored angel watches over the saint's every move, and crowds swirl about him. Tomie dePaola's Francis (Holiday, 1982) is elegant but restrained, his figures frozen in eternal time. Joanna Cole's A Gift from St. Francis (Morrow, 1989; o.p.) is simpler, with blocky, richly colored paintings by Michele Lemieux.

He questions whether its top politico-economic propagators are themselves really patriotic, given how they evade taxes, export our jobs, pollute our land and plunder the public treasury.</p><p>With incisive probing and a humorous touch, Parenti addresses such urgent questions as: What does it mean to love one&#x2019;s country? Why is it so important to be Number One? What determines America&#x2019;s &#x201c;greatness?&#x201d; He examines how US leaders and the corporate media fan the flames of fear to win support for huge arms budgets, global aggrandizement and the suppression of political dissent at home and abroad.</p><p>Finally, he poses an alternative to superpatriotism, arguing that the real patriots are those who care enough to educate themselves about our country&#x2019;s history and its present plight. He reminds us that it is not &#x201c;anti-American&#x201d; to criticize unjust social conditions at home or oppose global policies pursued by our rulers.

Augusten Burroughs has, and in this caustically funny, nostalgic, poignant, and moving collection he recounts Christmases past and present&#x2014;as only he could. With gimleteyed wit and illuminated prose, Augusten shows how the holidays bring out the worst in us and sometimes, just sometimes, the very, very best.</p><p>Augusten Burroughs is the author of <i>Running with Scissors</i>, <i>Dry</i>, <i>Magical Thinking: True Stories</i>, <i>Possible Side Effects</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Wolf at the Table</i>.

IIt&#x2019;s that the things even a nitwit could do with little or no instruction often confused me. Simple, everyday sorts of things tripped me up. Stacking metal chairs, for example. Everybody in class just seemed to know exactly how to fold the seat up into the back and then nest them all together like Prin�gles potato chips. I sat on the floor for ten minutes with one of the things as if somebody had told me to just stare at it. Concentrate hard, Augusten, try and turn it into an eggplant with your mind. You can do it! The other children appeared to be born with some sort of innate knowledge, as though the action of fold�ing and stacking child-size metal school chairs was gene tically encoded within each of them, like fi nger�nails or a sigmoid colon. <br>I seemed to lack the ability to comprehend the obvi�ous. From the very beginning there had been warning signs. <br>Like every kid just starting school, I had to memo�rize the Pledge of Allegiance&#x2014;something that would in many towns today be considered prayer and therefore forbidden; akin to forcing a child to drink the blood of a sacrificial goat or unfurl a Tabriz prayer rug and kneel barefoot on it while facing Mecca. <br>While I managed to learn the words, memorizing isn&#x2019;t the same as understanding. And of course I was never tested on the meaning of the pledge. It must have sim�ply been taken for granted that even the dimmest child would easily grasp the meaning of a phrase such as I pledge allegiance, especially when that phrase was spoken while standing at strict attention and facing the Ameri�can flag, hand in a salute above the heart. There was so little room for misinterpretation. It was the Pledge of Allegiance, not Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret. <br>Still. If one of the teachers had asked me to explain the meaning of those words&#x2014;which I chanted parrot- minded and smiling each morning&#x2014;they certainly would have been shocked to hear me admit that while I didn&#x2019;t know exactly what it was about, I knew it had something to do with Pledge, the same furniture polish my mother used and that always, inexplicably, made me feel sunny. So each morning as I spoke those hallowed words, it was the bright yellow can with the glowing lem�ony scent that I pictured. &nbsp;Excerpted from You Better Not Cry by Augusten Burroughs.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Island Road, LLC.<br>Published in November 2009 by St. Martin's Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Reprint.</p><p>The tragedy of the <i>Titanic</i> has been captured in fiction, nonfiction, music, poetry, cartoons, official judicial inquiry, survivors' recollections, still photography, TV shows, and film; all of the above are covered to some extent in this good and popular book. But few <i>Titanic</i> books match the paintings by Ken Marschall, a specialist on the subject whose work can be found in other books by the ship's discoverer, Robert Ballard, who wrote the introduction here. The photos are notable--including shots of the red-paint-stained iceberg that may have caused the sinking, the pristine ship, the sunken wreck, the people involved in the case--but Marschall's dozens of large-scale paintings really do help to dramatize and explicate moments no camera glimpsed and few eyewitnesses agree upon. <p> There is much to recommend the text, too. You could make a movie just about Second Officer Charles Lightoller, who helped accelerate the lifeboat-launching process, saving lives; stepped off the ship's bridge into the Atlantic; was sucked down into a ventilator taking in water, vainly swimming against its suction; and then got expelled by a blast of air, like a human cannonball in a circus, and landed next to a lifeboat that had been knocked 20 feet clear of the sinking ship's deadly whirlpool by a huge ship's funnel that crashed into the waves nearby. Lightoller was marvelously clever in his courtroom interrogation by an attorney determined to maneuver him into admitting blame for the disaster.</p><p> There is much more history in between the dramatic illustrations, facts both grand and trivial--if you're bent on knowing what actually happened to the dogs aboard, the answer is in this book. Definitely one of the better titles dealing with <i>Titanic</i>. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p><b>Donald Lynch</b> is a premier historian on the <i>Titanic </i>and a member of the <i>Titanic </i>Historical Society.

New Iberia, Louisiana, perfectly rivals Marlowe's L.A. for its grit and corruption and dames who'll turn a good guy bad. <p> James Lee Burke's 11th Robicheaux book, <i>Sunset Limited</i>, is a twisted mystery that at times becomes almost byzantine in its attempt to keep disparate characters and narratives wound in a cohesive story line. But Burke's writing is so stunning that all is forgiven as you become immersed in the tale, which meshes past and present to uncover the secret of a decades-old murder. </p><p> Forty years ago, a local labor leader was crucified in a crime that remains unsolved. Now, his daughter--Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Megan Flynn--returns to New Iberia. With a seemingly insignificant remark to Robicheaux, she begins a chain of events that lead right back to her father's death. New Iberia, in some sense, is frozen in time as the age-old problems of race and class weave their way into the mystery, complicating Robicheaux's discovery of not only the original crime, but the wealth of murders that spring up along the way. Add in the Chinese mob, corrupt policemen, and a Hollywood film shoot, and the stage is set. </p><p> Burke's forte is his ability to create characters so evil they're liable to get you up in the night to check in your closet and under your bed. The players--both good and bad--are characterized more by their flaws than their attributes, giving everyone a wicked sheen. The book isn't overly gory (although short descriptions can be rather graphic), but <i>everyone</i> has a dark side, emphasizing the <i>noir</i>-ish tones of the novel. His writing is powerful, mixing tender landscapes ("[W]e dropped through clouds that were pooled with fire in the sunrise and came in over biscuit-colored hills dotted with juniper and pine and pinyon trees...") with dead-on, cutting descriptions ("His face was tentacled with a huge purple-and-strawberry birthmark, so that his eyes looked squeezed inside a mask") and the camp dialogue of Chandler ("Evil doesn't have a zip code"). Oddly, these sundry elements blend seamlessly, allowing you to overlook tenuous connections and occasionally confusing turns. </p><p> Don't pick this up expecting a happy ending. But for those who long for a modern-day Chandler, you'll find <i>Sunset Limited</i> a gripping and satisfying read. <i>--Jenny Brown</i></p>Critical acclaim for James Lee Burke:<p>"If you haven't already discovered Burke's novels, find one."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"Burke is a brilliant descriptive writer, perhaps the best in modern American fiction."<br><i>--Portland Oregonian</i></p><p>"Terrific reading. Few writers in America can evoke a region as well as Burke."<br><i>--Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p><p>"Burke is a master at setting mood, laying in atmosphere, all with quirky, raunchy dialogue that's a delight."<br> --Elmore Leonard</p><p>"Burke flies miles above most contemporary crime novelists."<br><i>--Orlando Sentinel</i></p><p></p></p><h2>The Art of Fabric Collage: An Easy Introduction to Creative Sewing</h2><p>Fabric collage is a new method of quilting that gives every sewer the ability to express personal creativity while learning innovative sewing techniques. In The Art of Fabric Collage, designer Rosemary Eichorn uses a friendly, personal approach to show how to move beyond traditional quilting into a fascinating area she herself pioneered.<p>Eichorn gives readers tips on experimenting with color, design, and fabric in creating their own distinctive fabric collages. Instructions are included for a variety of surface design techniques, from free-motion stitching and soft-edge applique to continuous-strip prairie points and intriguing closures. She shows step by step how to use fabric collage to create artful vests, jackets, quilts, wall hangings, and more. Advice on how to adapt garment patterns for a variety of figure-flattering styles and construction techniques is also included.</p></p><p>Eichorn was awarded the Grand Prize in the 1995 Sulky Challenge and has a fabric-collage ensemble included in the 1997 Fairfield Fashion Show. She was alos a participant in the 1998 Threads Magazine Design Challenge.Eichorn argues that anyone with access to a sewing machine that will accommodate free-motion sewing can learn creative fabric collage techniques. Fabric collage combines sewing, quilting, machine appliqu , and embroidery to create a unique textile piece attached to a background fabric. When washed and dried in a home washing machine/dryer, this one-of-a-kind collage blooms into a fabric that can be used as a focal point in vests, coats, jackets, etc. In this beautifully illustrated manual, Eichorn walks the reader step by step through choosing fabrics, finding design inspiration, preparing the fabrics, creating the collage, and incorporating it into garments. She pays particular attention to quality finishing techniques, including lining fabric collage garments, choosing appropriate closures, and adding tassels, prairie-point edgings, and shisha mirrors. An excellent choice for public libraries and textile collections. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Two in the Far North</h2><p><p>This enduring story of life, adventure, and love in Alaska was&nbsp;written by a woman who embraced the remote Alaskan wilderness and became one of its strongest advocates.&nbsp; In this moving testimonial to the preservation of the Arctic wilderness, Mardy Murie writes from her heart about growing up in Fairbanks,&nbsp; becoming the first woman graduate of the University of Alaska, and marrying noted biologist Olaus J. Murie. So begins her lifelong journey in Alaska and on to Jackson Hole, Wyoming where along with her husband and others, they founded The Wilderness Society.&nbsp; Mardy's work as one of the earliest female voices for the wilderness movement earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p></p><p><p></p> <p>Margaret E. Murie was born in Seattle, Washington, but grew up attending public schools in Fairbanks, Alaska.&nbsp; She was the first woman graduate of the University of Alaska. Two months after her graduation, she married the biologist Olaus J. Murie. Their epic honeymoon journey by dogsled into the Brooks Range of Alaska&#x2019;s far north set the stage for their marriage and their careers with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and as director of the Wilderness Society. After Olaus passed away in 1963, Mardy continued writing and working tirelessly as a pioneer of the environmental movement. She received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Alaska, and President William J. Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her inspiring efforts to safeguard America&#x2019;s wilderness for future generations. Mardy passed away in her home in Moose, Wyoming at the age of 101. &nbsp;</p><b>Two in the Far North</b> is the life story of Margaret Murie, who grew up in Alaska before it was a state, tramped its wild lands before they were mapped, and has worked hard to preserve its wild places. She went North at age nine to a new life in a log cabin in Fairbanks. Her childhood was filled with the dangers and thrills of life on the frontier: the night the town caught fire and her father and the other men burned the town's bacon supply to keep the water pump going; an exciting cross country trip on the last dog sled mail run of the year over rivers that were breaking up; the dazzling weekly arrival of the mail sleigh with its flamboyant driver. When she graduated from college she married - at three a.m., just before the Arctic sun rose - a young biologist named Olaus Murie. Together they spent the next fifty years exploring and mapping the wilderness of Alaska, researching, studying, and counting its wildlife by dogsled, snowshoe, skis, boat, and floatplane - sometimes with a baby in tow. All of these adventures she shares in buoyant, lively prose. For Margaret Murie it is the people as much as the place that makes Alaska home, and her book is a loving tribute to both. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Margaret Liddiard</i></p><h2>People of the Silence: A Novel of the Anasazi (The First North Americans series, Book 8)</h2><p><p>At its pinnacle in A.D. 1150 the Anasazi empire of the Southwest would see no equal in North America for almost eight hundred years.

Young Fawn turned and saw him drop to his knees in the middle of the trail, his white ritual shirt aglow with starlight. Huge sandstone boulders surrounded him. Many sun cycles ago they had broken free from the towering canyon wall and tumbled into the valley to stand like monstrous guardians along the Tuming-Back-the-Sun trail. Kneeling in their midst, Sternlight looked pitifully small. Long black hair fluttered around him as he rocked back and forth, his face in his hands, his necklace of copper bells jingling. His cries resembled a lost child's. "No," he kept whimpering. "No, please ..." He had stopped twice in the past hand of time. At first, he had pounded his fists on the ground. Now he wept inconsolably. Young Fawn knew little about the trials of priests, but even she could tell he was weary beyond exhaustion. He had been praying for sixteen days, eating only cactus buttons, and begging the ancestor Spirits to help him. Now, it seemed, the ghosts would not leave him alone. Young Fawn leaned against a rock and folded her arms on her pregnant belly. Golden owl eyes sparkled in every hollow of the dark sandstone cliff, watching, wondering. To the south, fires gleamed. Fourteen large towns and over two hundred smaller villages lined the canyon walls. The priests would be rising, readying themselves for morning prayers on this critical day of the sun cycle. The fires cast a wavering yellow gleam over the massive sandstone bluff on the opposite side of the canyon. It looked dark and brooding this early, but when Father Sun rose, the sandstone would turn so golden it would appear molten. Young Fawn sighed. The tang of sage scented the wind, but the fragrance did little to soothe her fears. Sternlight spoke softly to someone, and apparently received an answer he did not wish to hear. "But why must I do it?" he wept. He lifted his head and looked to his right. As he shook his head, his long black hair flashed silver. "Why me?" At the age of twenty-seven, Sternlight had been Talon Town's Sunwatcher for nine winters, and his reputation had grown with each one. Chiefs as far away as three moons' walk relied upon his advice. Young Fawn had seen their messengers arrive, packs filled with extraordinary gifts. Over the cycles, stories about Sternlight's wealth had become legend. It was said that twenty rooms at Talon Town brimmed with his fortune--and some dared to whisper that only witchery paid so well. Young Fawn nervously smoothed her palms over her turkey-feather cape. The brown-and-white feathers glistened in the light. Witches--her own people called them sleep-makers--had great Power. By jumping through a hoop of twisted yucca fibers, they could change themselves into animals, and they used rawhide shields to fly about, spying on people. The most terrifying sleep-makers raided burials to gather putrefying corpse flesh, which they dried and ground into a fine powder. Once the soul had left the body, only corruption and wickedness remained. Corpse powder concentrated that evil, and when sprinkled on someone, could cause death or madness. Young Fawn had been captured in a raid ten summers ago, but she remembered the sleep-makers among her own people, the Mogollon, who lived far to the south. The Straight Path people called them Fire Dogs, for the Mogollon believed that they had originally come to earth in the form of wolves made from gouts of Father Sun's fire. The Mogollon and the Straight Path people raided each other constantly, taking slaves, stealing food. Her father, Jay Bird, was the greatest and most powerful Mogollon chief. Sleep-makers had continually tried to kill him. ... And the earth had quaked each time, as if the ancestor spirits who lived in the underworlds were enraged by the foolishness of the witches. Young Fawn reached up to touch the small bags of sacredcommeal she wore around her throat. On occasion, when she missed her family, she thought about those sleep-makers and wondered if their Power had grown over the long summers. Was her father still alive? The earth continued to quake, more often of late, and she took each tremor as a great omen that he had survived yet another attempt on his life. The Straight Path people, however, took the recent rash of quakes to mean that their ancestors were growing more and more angry with the greed and malice that filled the hearts of their descendants. Young Fawn glanced at Sternlight. Could he be a sleep-maker? She had to admit that strange things did happen around him. His older sisters had vanished before they'd turned fifteen summers, and no traces had ever been found. Though rumors persisted that they had been taken slave by the Mogollon, Sternlight's cousin, the great warrior, Webworm, had suggested a dire possibility. Sleep-makers lived very long lives--at the expense of their families. When a sleep-maker grew ill, or wanted to extend his life, he used a spindle to extract his relative's heart and put it in his own chest. After Sternlight's second sister disappeared, Webworm spent days going from family member to family member, begging them to help him kill Sternlight. Both had been very young at the time, Webworm thirteen, and Sternlight fourteen. Webworm's accusation had been taken very seriously. Sternlight, it was said, had truly feared for his life. The penalty for witchery was death, and the sleep-maker's own family had to carry out the sentence. When they'd killed him, they would throw him facedown in a grave and cover his body with a heavy sandstone slab so that his Spirit could never escape. Alone, locked in darkness, the ghost would wail for all eternity. But no one could hear. No one could save him. Young Fawn jumped when a flock of pi�on jays soared over the canyon rim. Against the twinkling background of the Evening People, they whirled like windblown black leaves. Long ago the jays had lived among her people as sacred clowns, Dancing, bringing laughter, and teaching spiritual lessons. They had chosen to be reborn as birds to watch over the Mogollon people. <i>Keep me safe, guardians. I fear I need your protection on this day.</i> Sternlight whispered, "Don't tell me that! I ... I can't." Young Fawn glanced at him. He had his hand out to no one she could see. Clenching her fists over her belly, she waited. No matter how desperately she longed to run away, she could not. It would shame her master and bring terrible punishment upon herself. Last moon, the wife of the Blessed Sun had selected Young Fawn as Solstice Girl. The choice had been a competition between Young Fawn and her best friend, Mourning Dove, a fact which had delighted them both. Ordinarily, much older, wiser slaves received the honor. Because of that, Young Fawn performed her tasks with great care. She washed the priest's ritual clothes with yucca soap and pine needles to give them a pleasant scent; held his sacred herbs next to her heart to keep their Spirits warm; made certain the blood of his meats never fell upon the ground, for that might offend his animal Spirit helpers. Despite her youth, she tried to be the best Solstice Girl ever. But as the child in her belly grew, the work became increasingly difficult. Sternlight pulled himself to his feet and stood on shaking legs. The turquoise and jet bracelets on his arms winked and sparkled in the silvery light. She called, "Elder, are you well?" He jerked around, and his copper bell necklaces jingled wildly. His eyes went huge. "Who--who are you?" "I am Young Fawn. Don't you remember?" As sunrise approached, the evil Spirit child, Wind Baby, raced through the canyon, bending the scrawny weeds, flicking dust about and whistling around boulders. He ruffled Young Fawn's turkey-feather cape and probed at her white dress beneath, his fingers frigid. She shivered. "Young Fawn?" Sternlight came forward like a man picking his way through a field of rattlesnakes. "You are Young Fawn?" "Yes, Elder." A hollow sensation swelled her heart. What a beautiful man. He had a straight nose and full lips. When he was an infant, the back of his skull had been flattened by the cradleboard,shoving his cheekbones forward and accentuating his deeply set brown eyes. Each time his moccasins struck the ground, the seashells tied to the laces made music. His knee-length shirt, woven from the finest cotton thread, outlined every muscle in his tall body. <i>He looks like one of the sacred sky gods fallen. to earth.</i> He halted a hand's breadth from her, and in a pained voice said, "I prayed you would not be here. Why are you here?" "I am the Solstice Girl for this cycle. I go where you go. I do as you tell me." Gently, she took his arm and headed him on down the trail. They entered a grove of stunted junipers protected from cutting by the Blessed Sun's decree. There, the light fragmented, scattering their path with pewter triangles and glimmering over the clusters of small purple berries among the green needles. Young Fawn proceeded with care. Deer had scooped out beds in the duff, and rocks thrust up along the way, both threats to safe footing. All around them, gnarled gray branches reached upward for the blessings of the sky gods. Sternlight gazed at her anxiously, eyes focused on her swollen belly in disbelief. "You are Solstice Girl?" "Yes, Sunwatcher. I have been serving you for a full moon now." The trail swung around a large pile of fallen rock and entered the sun cove, a hollow worn in the canyon wall by eons of spring runoff. Sternlight took one look at the stairs cut into the stone, and utter terror masked his face. He threw off her hand and backed away. "No," he breathed, "Oh, no. I can't go up there!" "But," Young Fawn said, "we must hurry. We have barely two fingers of time before dawn. You know how frightening the drought and warfare have become. You must help make it right. This is your duty. You are Sunwatcher." His mouth quivered. Behind him, the flock of pi�on jays wheeled, their cackles wavering in Wind Baby's gusts. Sternlight balled his fists. "You ... you go first. I will wait until you are at the top, then I will follow. Yes, I--I will. Now go." When she hesitated, he shook both fists at her. "Go!" She hitched up her white hem and began the climb. Ice filled the rocky depressions, watching her like ancient glazed eyes.The last rainstorm had washed sand and gravel down the steps. Her yucca sandals <i>shished</i> on the grit. By the time Young Fawn reached the narrow ledge overlooking the canyon, she was panting. A gently undulating surface, the ledge extended about four body lengths by five. A sandstone wall, taller than Young Fawn, ran along the north side. Scraggly rabbitbrush struggled to grow on top of the wall. A magnificent vista spread around her. Chunky buttes rose like square towers from the desert floor, their sandstone faces shading purple and pink in the newborn light. She could see two of the three sacred mountains. In front of her, Thunder Peak rose in the south; to her right, Turquoise Maiden made a black hump against the eastern horizon. Spider Woman's Butte hid behind a translucent lavender veil. The few shreds of cloud that clung to her face glowed a rich magenta color. Two thousand people lived in the canyon, and their breakfast fires sparkled like a huge overturned box of amber jewels. Wonder filled Young Fawn. Among her people, beauty was sacred, and appreciating it, a prayer. Gingerly, she lowered herself to the cold stone and encircled her belly with her arms. She would catch her breath, and then, if Sternlight had not arrived, she would go looking for him. An ancient painting adorned the sandstone wall above where she sat--a white circle with rays emanating from all four sides. The Straight Path people claimed that the symbol had been drawn by Coyote in the Age of Emergence, immediately after their ancestors climbed through the four underworlds and out into this fifth world of light. She knew the Straight Path story by heart: " <i>Look</i>!" Coyote had said. " <i>I have drawn a map of the Center Place and the four roads of life and death. Listen, now, and I will tell you what it means.</i> <i>"There is a Great Circle; it is so huge it holds everything, for it is the universe, and all that live inside the Great Circle are relatives. When you stand at the heart of the circle, in the Center Place, you can see that the circle has four quarters. Each is sacred, for each has a mystical Power, and it is by those powers that we survive. Each quarter also has its ownsacred animals, objects, and colors--these make its power accessible to humans.</i> <i>"When you pray, you must first look down the east road to the dawn place where all the days of humans are born. Its color is white like the snows. It has the power to heal. White clay will cleanse, and the white hide of an albino buffalo will drive away sickness. Only the very strong may run this road to ask advice or give aid to Father Sun. The weak will be melted.</i> <i>"Then you must look down the south road. It is red-hot like the summer. The pepper pod is its plant, and the ant its animal. This road is only for the dead, or those tending ceremonial tasks. They may travel it to the sacred Humpback Butte, where they will find the ladder to the four skyworlds. Those who climb up will become rain gods, and have the Power to make things grow and flourish.</i> <i>"Next you must look down the road where Father Sun dies, and all of the days of humans have gone and shall go. Its color is yellow. Its animal is the bear. It has the power to bring peace. The Evening People hold its wisdom. This road is only for the living. People may run it to talk with the Evening People, to learn to live as one.</i> <i>"Last is the north road. Its color is blue-black like the thunder clouds. Its stone is turquoise. It has the power to kill. It leads to the sipapu, the tunnel of emergence, and the entry to the four underworlds where the ancestors live. Only the dead, and their helpers, may run this road. The entrance to the sipapu is guarded by a huge black badger.</i> <i>"Where the blue-black road of the dead meets the white road of the living at the Center Place is very holy. There coils the Rainbow Serpent. Her symbol is the sacred lightning-spiral. For those who look upon the Rainbow Serpent with newborn eyes, she shall wake and arc across the face of the world, and they may climb onto her back and rise into the skyworlds without dying. And, if they dare, they may speak with the gods."</i> Young Fawn gazed to the northwest, toward the Center Place where the roads met. Talon Town sat at the base of the bluff just beneath it. Every morning she looked up, hoping to see the Rainbow Serpent sparkle to life, but she never had. Nor had anyone now living, though the elders spoke of a time longago when the Straight Path people had seen her arc across the heavens often. But extraordinarily holy people had lived in the canyon then, men and women who ran the east road routinely--people whose profane eyes had been burned away by the brilliant white light. When they grew sacred eyes, and gained the courage to look again, the Rainbow Serpent uncoiled and leaped into the sky. Young Fawn exhaled in longing. <i>I would give my very life to see that.</i> Her gaze drifted to her right. In the southeast the sacred rock pillar punctured the heavens. Father Sun had risen over that pillar for the past fiftee...</p><h2>The End of Alice: A Novel</h2><p>A riveting account of sexual addiction and murder is set inside the mind of a violent sex offender now in his twenty-third year of confinement, as told to a nineteen-year-old college girl, presently preying on a young boy herself, with whom he corresponds. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>A novel that shines a flashlight under the bed of suburban perversity.

In 1967, he joined the first wave of intellectuals who moved to the countryside as volunteers, living with nomadic communities on the Chinese border of Inner and Outer Mongolia for eleven years. Following his return to Beijing, Jiang embarked on postgraduate studies in economics and political science and assumed an academic position at a Beijing university. Now retired, he lives in Beijing with his wife. <i>Wolf Totem</i> is his first novel. <br><br> Howard Goldblatt is the foremost translator of modern and contemporary Chinese literature in the West. He has published English translations of more than thirty novels and story collections by writers from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. He has also authored and edited half a dozen books on Chinese literature. He is a winner of the Translation of the Year Award given by the American Translators Association. The founding editor of the journal <i>Modern Chinese Literature</i>, he has written for <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Times1 of London, <i>Time</i> magazine, <i>World Literature Today</i>, and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>. He is currently a professor at the University of Notre Dame.</i>In this autobiographical novel set in the 1960s, the author leaves his life as an intellectual in Bejing and goes to the remote grasslands of Mongolia. There he becomes enthralled with the nomadic life and the synergies between the mongols and their environment, particularly the wolves with whom they share the grasslands. The long passages of exposition and description are handled adroitly by Jason Culp. Maintaining a strong, steady pace, he adopts the air of an interested observer who is at times surprised by what he sees and hears. He uses accents to draw out the contrast between the speech patterns and tonality of the Mongols, the students among them, and the Chinese who later come to drive the people into the modern world.

Reissue.</p><p>Bestselling author <b>Stephen Hunter </b>is a staff writer and film critic for <i>The Washington Post</i> and winner of The American Society of Newspaper Editors Award for Distinguished Writing in Criticism (1998), as well as the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for film criticism. He has written many novels, including <i>Havana</i>, <i>Pale Horse Coming</i>, and <i>The Day Before Midnight</i>.Hunter ( The Spanish Gambit ) has written a smoothly believable race-against-time thriller with frightening plausibility. Unidentified military terrorists kidnap welder Jack Hummel from his Maryland home and direct him to cut through a block of titanium to reach a launch key in the South Mountain MX missile site. The president decides to send in the crack Delta assault team, but the man best suited to command them is Col. Dick Puller, who was discredited and disgraced in Iran in 1979. Puller, in turn, must work with the only man who knows the missile silo, its designer, Prof. Peter Thiokol. The leader of "Aggressor-One" is discovered to be Russian Military Intelligence chief Arkady Pashin: he is charismatic, reactionary and messianically determined to launch the single MX that will trigger a massive Soviet reply. Part of the fast-moving plot revolves around two abandoned coalmine tunnels, a stupid Russian spy and Thiokol's estranged wife, who unwittingly gave the Russians the plans for South Mountain. The 7 a.m.-to-midnight action flashes cinematically on Delta Force, the crack Russian Spetsnaz troops and various civilians. The book is fun, even if the finale is too drawn-out and a bit preachy: " . . . the regular people, the Rest of US" will save us. 40,000 first printing; $40,000 ad budget. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beyond Belief: The American Press &amp; the Coming of the Holocaust 1933-1945</h2><p>Examines the coverage the American press gave to the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945, and explains how and why it failed to treat the destruction of European Jews as front-page news</p><p><b>Deborah Lipstadt</b>, author of <i>The Eichmann Trial</i> (2011), <i>History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving</i> (2005), and <i>Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust</i>, 1933-45 (1986), occupies the Dorot Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University.This most complete study to date of American press reactions to the Holocaust sets forth in abundant detail how the press nationwide played down or even ignored reports of Jewish persecutions over a 12-year period. The conclusions amplify but do not seriously challenge previous studies; what is more significant here is the effortfar from completeto explain press actions. While revealing more about major newspapers and correspondents than about the mass of smaller ones, and saying far too little about newsreels and American Jewish newspapers, this raises larger questions concerning the relationship between press coverage, public knowledge, and government policy that deserve serious consideration. Readers may wish that Lipstadt explained more and indicted less. Still, there is plenty of important data in this volume for serious students. Jonathan D.

Eighty years after his death in 1924, Kafka remains one of the most intriguing figures in the history of world literature. Now, after more than a decade of research, working with over four thousand pages of journal entries, letters, and literary fragments, Reiner Stach re-creates the atmosphere in which Kafka lived and worked from 1910 to 1915. These are the years of Kafka's fascination with early forms of Zionism despite his longing to be assimilated into the minority German culture in Prague; of his off-again, on-again engagement to Felice Bauer; of the outbreak of World War I; and above all of the composition of his seminal works-The Metamorphosis, Amerika, The Judgment, and The Trial. <br><br>Kafka:The Decisive Years-at once an extraordinary portrait of the writer and an original contribution to the art of literary biography. <br></p><p>REINER STACH is a widely respected writer, editor, and scholar. After working extensively on the definitive edition of Kafka's collected works, he devoted more than a decade to researching and writing this biography. He lives in Hamburg. <br>At Home with the Kafkas<br><br>The guiding principle of every community is <br>accepting others in order to be accepted.<br><br>-Franz Grillparzer, Diary<br><br>I SIT IN my room in the headquarters of the noise of the whole apartment. I hear all the doors slamming; their noise spares me only the steps of the people running between them; I can still hear the oven door banging shut in the kitchen. My father bursts through the door to my room and passes through, his robe trailing; the ashes are being scraped out of the stove in the next room; Valli asks, shouting one word after the other through the foyer, whether Father's hat has been cleaned yet; a hushing sound that aims to be friendly to me raises the screech of a voice in reply. The apartment door is unlatched and makes a grating noise like a scratchy throat, then opens wider with the singing of a woman's voice, and finally closes with a dull manly bang, which is the most inconsiderate sound of all. Father is gone; now the subtler, more diffuse, more hopeless noise begins, led by the voices of the two canaries. I had been thinking about it earlier, and with the canaries it now occurred to me again that I might open the door a tiny crack, slither into the next room like a snake and in that way, on the floor, ask my sisters and their governess for peace and quiet.<br><br>Kafka called this prose piece "Great Noise." He jotted it down in his diary on November 5, 1911, and about a year later published it in a Prague literary journal, for the "public flogging of my family,"1 since the circumstances depicted in it had not changed in the slightest. It is unlikely that Hermann Kafka ever saw with his own eyes the mark that his trailing robe left on German literature. Although Kafka's father was a stocky man and not yet sixty years old, no one was allowed to "excite" him. His blood pressure was out of control, he had respiratory and cardiac problems, and he did not appreciate humor at his own expense. Kafka's three sisters were sure to have greeted their author's copies with a flurry of giggles. "Valli" was there in black and white; Kafka had not even disguised the name of his middle sister.<br><br> The text had been written on a Sunday, and the few friends who knew the details of Kafka's life at home probably had a flash of recognition that this was the typical Sunday noise. Any other morning on the fourth floor of the apartment building at Niklasstrasse 36 in Prague was ruled by the dictates of the tenants' jobs. No one had the leisure to sit still at the table and record the acoustic events.<br><br> Mornings in the Kafka household typically began at about 6 A.M. The tedious and noisy manual labor was of course left to a servant girl: removing the ashes from the kitchen stove, preparing breakfast, heating the living room, and preparing warm water for washing. Still, Kafka's youngest sister, Ottilie, known as Ottla, had to get up just afterward. The daily morning chore that had fallen to her for years needed to be taken care of right after a quick breakfast. She hurried over to Zeltnergasse-near the Altst�dter Ring, about a kilometer away-with a set of keys to unlock Hermann Kafka's fancy goods store. The staff began arriving as early as 7:15.<br><br> Once Ottla had left the house, it was high time for Kafka to get out of bed. His small unheated room was poorly situated: between his parents' bedroom and the living room. On the one side there were clattering dishes; on the other he heard his mother whispering and the inconsiderate, loud yawning of his father, who tossed and turned in the creaking bed. Yet another problem was the door to the hall, which had panes of ornamented matte glass. Whenever somebody turned on the light outside, it shone inside as well.<br><br> Kafka's apartment was cramped and congested. His father's booming voice resounded throughout the apartment. Visitors were always greeted by the entire family, and a conversation in private required special arrangements if one did not want to be limited to surreptitious gestures. Nonetheless, there are no indications in Kafka's remarks that anyone actually suffered from this lack of privacy-apart from Kafka himself, of course. On Sunday mornings he was always overcome by slight nausea (a feeling he could not mention in his story) when he saw his parents' rumpled bedsheets only a few steps from his own bed. Yet he was in no position to complain: after all, he was the only family member to have his own room; his three sisters, Elli, Valli, and Ottla, had had to make do with a single "girls' room." Elli got married in the fall of 1910 and left the apartment. Kafka continued to share his living space with five adults (including the servant girl). The inhospitable atmosphere of the morning routine made him think more and more about putting an end to this situation.<br><br> There was no point trying to stretch out and luxuriate in bed for a last few minutes before getting up. The infamous canaries in the adjoining room (who were always replaced by new ones when they died) added to the ruckus, and Kafka dashed off to the bathroom to begin his fastidious routine of washing, combing his hair, and shaving. He treasured the luxury of having his own bathroom, which had been one of the primary factors in selecting this apartment. As the Kafkas knew from experience, there were plenty of lodgings in Prague that required occupants to carry in water; the tedious dealing with buckets and washbasins was both strenuous and time-consuming, and would hardly allow Kafka to maintain his rigid hygienic standards unless he began each day much earlier.<br><br> The efficient layout of the bathroom did nothing to change the fact that his morning routine was a long-drawn-out procedure. Rarely did he find the time to linger at the breakfast table longer than strictly necessary. Breakfast consisted of pastries, milk, and stewed fruit. At the Workers' Accident Insurance Institute, an official's workday began at 8 A.M., and the distance to Kafka's office was at least twice that to his parents' shop. Kafka brought along a roll with nothing on it. Since the elevator was so slow, he rushed down the four flights of stairs, several steps at a time, raced through the narrow streets of the Old City of Prague with remarkably long strides, said a quick hello to the porter of the institute as one of the last to arrive, and sprinted up the stairs to his department, again four flights. One of Kafka's colleagues later recalled: "It often happened that I saw him shooting into his office at a furious pace."2 You could set your watch by Kafka: a quarter after eight.<br><br> He remarked years later that "the immediate proximity of the working world" was inexorably bringing his literary productivity to a standstill.3 If his parents had ever seen this diary entry, they would have had difficulty construing its meaning. Their life was their working world. Not that they failed to draw a clear distinction between their private and public spheres; quite the contrary. This line of demarcation was strictly observed, as far as we know; no employee of their fancy goods store ever entered the proprietor's apartment, and never were financial problems discussed within earshot of the household help. However, the Kafkas ran a family business, in two senses of the term: the business belonged to the family-with the tacit expectation that this would remain the case indefinitely-and the family belonged to the business. It was taken for granted that Kafka's grandfather, Jakob L�wy, would still help out, even though he was over eighty years old. If legal representation was needed, the Kafkas consulted attorneys to whom they were related. Their daily schedule was so fully internalized to coordinate with the opening times of the store that Kafka's parents never felt comfortable in the forced idleness of brief vacations or stays at health resorts. They took time out not from the business but for the business. Even during midsummer weekends, when the family rented a vacation house in the vicinity, Hermann Kafka sometimes continued to work at the store for a few hours before joining the others.<br><br> Kafka's writings do not shed much light on the economic fortunes of the business, although his parents talked about it incessantly for as far back as he could remember. It grew slowly but steadily, yet there must have been worrisome slow periods; we can only speculate as to the causes. It was a sensitive business niche, because they dealt wholesale with nonessential items: parasols, walking sticks, gloves, handkerchiefs, buttons, fabrics, handbags, fine lingerie, muffs . . . accessories that people dispensed with when times were difficult; robust sales of these items were therefore good indicators of the standard of living as a whole. In the fall of 1912 the Kafkas succeeded in relocating the business to one of Prague's most prestigious addresses: the Kinsky Palace on the Altst�dter Ring, the same building in which Kafka had gone to school. The move to this building took them only right around the corner, barely a hundred yards away. However, hanging out one's shingle on the central square in the Old City signaled an increase in symbolic capital, which soon paid off in hard cash.<br>� S.

Brimming with the holiday spirit, an old-fashioned snowman-building contest, plenty of hot chocolate, and Esther's famous marmalade cake, this new boxed set of Mitford treats is guaranteed to fill readers-and stockings-with contagious good cheer.</p><p><b>Jan Karon</b>, born Janice Meredith Wilson in the foothills of North Carolina, was named after the title of a popular novel, Janice Meredith.<p>Jan wrote her first novel at the age of ten. "The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p><p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p><p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997. Bookstore owner, Shirley Sprinkle, says, "The Mitford Books have been our all-time fiction bestsellers since we went in business twenty-five years ago. We've sold 10,000 of Jan's books and don't see any end to the Mitford phenomenon."</p>Esther Bolick, mayor of Karon's beloved make-believe Mitford, bakes a marmalade cake for Christmas that is as sweet as her hometown. Her story, Esther's Gift, and The Mitford Snowmen-both included in this holiday collection-are previously published, stocking stuffer-sized narratives that Karon's fans have mostly likely already consumed with zeal, but the title novel is fresh entertainment that Mitford aficionados can enjoy while they do their own holiday baking. Sounding like Santa himself might, reader McDonough rumbles out these cheery tales, using dramatic pauses, lilting character voices and, at times, simple a cappella renditions of hymns to convey the upbeat innocence of the town and its residents. Choir music by Journey of the Soul fills the gaps between the novel and short stories, soaring as high as listeners' emotions will when Father Tim presents a restored nativity scene to his wife, Cynthia, on Christmas Eve. Though this audio production may be too cloying for some listeners, others will be buoyed by McDonough's jovial narration and the novel's inspirational themes.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the Soviet people looked back on decades of war and famine, conquest and achievement, and forward to sweeping changes during a time of new leadership and openness, the photographers were granted unprecedented access to homes, factories, schools and even prisons. They traveled to all 15 Soviet republics and across 11 time zones. They ventured into areas that have been closed to outsiders for centuries, and they came back with candid images of the daily life of the people behind the headlines, capturing a lost Soviet era, the twilight of a country.They flew into a country where even photographing bridges is a crime, landing at one of to few international airports in the world where camera are banned, with the single-minded purpose of taking pictures. In all, a star-studded coterie of 100 international photographers...in pursuit of a subject so vast it takes nine hours to cross by airplane and so elusive that a description of a thousand words would only be a beginning: one day in the life of the Soviet Union. -- <i>The Washington Post</i></p><h2>Warlock: A Novel of Ancient Egypt (Novels of Ancient Egypt)</h2><p>One of the world's most acclaimed adventure writers returns to the world of ancient Egypt with the stunning sequel to the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling <i>River God</i>.

By the time of her death, in 2002, it was being practiced everywhere, from Brooklyn to Berlin to Ulaanbaatar. In <i>The Goddess Pose,</i> <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Michelle Goldberg traces the life of the incredible woman who brought yoga to the West&#x2014;and in so doing paints a sweeping picture of the twentieth century.<br><br> Born into the minor aristocracy (as Eugenia Peterson), Devi grew up in the midst of one of the most turbulent times in human history. Forced to flee the Russian Revolution as a teenager, she joined a famous Berlin cabaret troupe, dove into the vibrant prewar spiritualist movement, and, at a time when it was nearly unthinkable for a young European woman to travel alone, followed the charismatic Theosophical leader Jiddu Krishnamurti to India. <br><br> Once on the subcontinent, she performed in Indian silent cinema and hobnobbed with the leaders of the independence movement. But her greatest coup was convincing a recalcitrant master yogi to train her in the secrets of his art. <br><br> Devi would go on to share what she learned with people around the world, teaching in Shanghai during World War II, then in Hollywood, where her students included Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo. She ran a yoga school in Mexico during the height of the counterculture, served as spiritual adviser to the colonel who tried to overthrow Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, and, in her eighties, moved to Buenos Aires at the invitation of a besotted rock star. <br> Everywhere she went, Indra Devi evangelized for yoga, ushering in a global craze that continues unabated. Written with vivid clarity,&nbsp;<i>The Goddess Pose</i>&nbsp;brings her remarkable story&#x2014;as an actress, yogi, and globetrotting adventuress&#x2014;to life.</p><p>Michelle Goldberg is a journalist and the author of <i>Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism,</i> a <i>New York Times</i> best seller that was a finalist for the New York Public Library&#x2019;s Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism, and <i>The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power, and the Future of the World</i>.

Each pose was a reminder of the lifelong inflexibility that had often mortified me. When I was a little girl, a sadistic ballet teacher barred me from a holiday party because of my terrible splits. In elementary school, I dreaded being forced to sit &#x201c;Indian style,&#x201d; because it left my hips and back screaming. Later, trying yoga, my awkward efforts to keep my legs and back straight while touching my toes and my inability to do even a half lotus only left me tense and humiliated, convinced that the practice was best for those who were already calm, willowy, and graceful.<br> &nbsp;<br> Besides, while I&#x2019;d been captivated by India&#x2019;s kaleidoscopic religious richness during months of traveling, I was wary of anyone purporting to peddle enlightenment to credulous Westerners. On my first trip to the country, a short backpacking sojourn in the late 1990s, I&#x2019;d read and loved Gita Mehta&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Karma Cola</i>, a wry Indian look at the Western spiritual tourists who flock to the subcontinent, and the enterprising Indian sages who&#x2019;ve risen to meet the demand. &#x201c;As our home industry expands on every front, at last it is our turn to mass market,&#x201d; she writes. The hippie spiritual scene interested me as&nbsp;a journalistic subject, but I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to participate in it. I&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t sure if I could even chant &#x201c;Om&#x201d; with a straight face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet, I needed exercise. Living in McLeod Ganj, a mountain village just outside the city of Dharamsala, where the Tibetan exile movement was headquartered, I was sick of hiking. My husband and I&#x2014;we&#x2019;d eloped the previous year, when I was twenty-four and he was twenty-eight&#x2014;were about six months into what would be a year-long trip through Asia. Prior to our departure, he&#x2019;d worked at an Internet start-up. When he cashed out his stock options before they bottomed out in the crash of the late 1990s, we became Internet thousandaires, with a sum in the low five figures that seemed, at the time, to be a fortune. Both of us loved to travel. Putting all our stuff in storage, we flew to Ho Chi Minh City.<br> &nbsp;<br> After three months bumming around Southeast Asia, we went from Singapore to the tip of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, then west to the relatively idyllic state of Kerala, where, while lying on a beach, we were approached by movie producers looking for extras for an Indian musical. They were shooting a scene in an ashram, and since no Indian ashram is complete without a handful of flaky Westerners, they asked for our help. Delighted, we agreed. On set, we met a thirty-two-year-old Argentine devotee of the real-life guru Sai Baba, about whom I&#x2019;d long been curious. His followers believe he&#x2019;s God, and I&#x2019;d seen his face, beaming beneath his surprising Afro, on stickers and trinkets for sale all over the country. A former medical student, the Argentine had given up her studies and her Buenos Aires apartment after dreaming that Sai Baba summoned her to India.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later, as we snaked our way north, we visited her at Sai Baba&#x2019;s enormous Prasanthi Nilayam ashram, in a barren corner of Andhra Pradesh, one of India&#x2019;s poorest states. The ashram boasted a shiny planetarium, two hospitals that treated patients for free, a college, a music school, and a brand-new airport for wealthier devotees with private planes. Around the edges, luxury apartment buildings were replacing mud huts. Rather than requesting two of the ashram&#x2019;s ten thousand beds, we checked into a nearby hotel. Every afternoon, a loudspeaker piped in music praising the guru. When I bought a pen at a local shop to take notes, it had Sai Baba&#x2019;s smiling face on it.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was an ambient spiritual hysteria at Prasanthi Nilayam. At dinner one evening, a devotee we&#x2019;d become friendly with pointed out an Austrian woman tugging her listless seven-year-old son behind her. She was in the midst of a spiritual crisis because she&#x2019;d had a dream in which Sai Baba instructed her to abandon the boy and live on the streets as a beggar, and she didn&#x2019;t know if she had the &#x201c;strength&#x201d; to do it. As far as I could tell, no one at the ashram was stepping forward to discourage her.<br> &nbsp;<br> I also heard rumors of sexual abuse and was shocked to meet old hands at the ashram who accepted these stories as true, though they interpreted the molestations as part of Sai Baba&#x2019;s divine mission. One man, an American ex-motivational speaker, thought they were part of Baba&#x2019;s plan to spread his message. &#x201c;Probably more people are going to know about you if there are allegations that you&#x2019;re a pedophile than if you say God is incarnated on earth,&#x201d; he told me.&nbsp;I ended up writing a story about all this for&nbsp;<i>Salon</i>. It didn&#x2019;t leave me any more eager to find a guru.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arriving in McLeod Ganj, weeks later, my husband and I saw a flyer seeking volunteers to teach English at a school for Tibetan refugees. After months of lassitude, we were thrilled and relieved at the chance to be useful and threw ourselves into the work. Settling down for several months in the sweet, peaceful little town, blessedly cool after months on the roasting plains, I realized I needed to get in shape. Most travelers who wander around India on the cheap lose weight, but I have an iron stomach, as well as a weakness for nan and paneer tikka masala. There was a three-hour ashtanga-based yoga class that met early every morning in a gymnasium near the center of town, and I signed up for it.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was excruciating. I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but ashtanga was initially based on exercise routines developed for teenage boys. The jump-backs we did between poses&#x2014;like squat-thrusts followed by&nbsp;half push-ups&#x2014;were channels for an animal energy I&#x2019;d never possessed. The contortions required for binding poses were out of reach,&nbsp;the inversions terrifying, and I still couldn&#x2019;t do a split, but I kept going back, at first because I wanted to lose weight, then because my friends in town were also going, and finally because it left me feeling fantastic.<br> &nbsp;<br> A lot of the credit goes to my teacher, Vijay, a Gumby-limbed South Indian who could toss his ankle behind his neck as casually as if he were flinging a scarf. Vijay had very few pretensions. Once, catching me smoking a cigarette, he plucked it out of my fingers&#x2014;and then started puffing on it himself. &#x201c;Vijay, what are you doing? You&#x2019;re a yogi!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;Michelle,&#x201d; he said to me with a gleam in his eye, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a yogi. I&#x2019;m a businessman.&#x201d; I appreciated this sort of candor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I left India, Vijay said to me, &#x201c;Smoking won&#x2019;t interfere with your yoga, but yoga will interfere with your smoking.&#x201d; This turned out to be true; a year later, I quit. By then, my husband and I were living in Brooklyn. I was working as a journalist and writing about politics, which often left me knotted and angry. Yoga became a refuge. Sometimes I practiced four or five times a week. In the ritual and community of classes, I began to sense some of the consolation that others find in religion. Though still not a believer in anything supernatural, I felt the benefits of stepping outside the rush of ordinary life and trying to attune myself to a higher state of consciousness, however inchoate and fleeting. The discipline of paying attention to the habitual way your thoughts unfold, to the familiar grooves of your mind, seemed like cognitive therapy, but cheaper. I loved that I could find psychological solace and a workout at the same time.<br> &nbsp;<br> I would never be lithe or supple, but I learned to do things with my body that I hadn&#x2019;t thought possible. Occasionally, I would even feel that there was something positive in the tedious loathing I&#x2019;d always felt for my never-skinny frame, since without that loathing, I might never have taken up yoga in the first place.<br> &nbsp;<br> But while I loved yoga, I also wondered about it. The claims made for the curative powers of certain poses&#x2014;the idea that one specific arrangement of limbs could treat depression, another fight&nbsp;headaches or PMS&#x2014;seemed almost magical. I cringed at the way some of my American teachers romanticized India, a country that, for all its religious magnificence, can also be a place of staggering brutality. And I knew that despite descriptions of postural yoga as a quintessentially Indian discipline, the sweaty, fast-paced style I was practicing in New York was hard to find outside of tourist enclaves on the subcontinent. Everyone in my yoga class back in McLeod Ganj had been from the United States, Europe, Australia, or Israel. Vijay told me his own teacher had been a Frenchman. The Indian yogis I encountered, by contrast, tended to be dreadlocked mendicants practicing torturous physical austerities&#x2014;standing on one leg for days, sleeping on a bed of nails&#x2014;that seemed a universe away from anything one learns in a modern yoga class.<br> &nbsp;<br> Among Western yogis, the standard explanation for the relative scarcity of their style of yoga in India is that most Indians have lost touch with their heritage. Still, I was curious what exactly the connection was between the ash-covered sadhus I&#x2019;d seen contorting themselves on the banks of the Ganges in Benares and the invigorating stretches, lunges, twists, and handstands I practiced first in McLeod Ganj and then in ninety-minute sessions on a rubber mat in Brooklyn. I started looking around for a book or an article that would explain it. And at some point, I came across the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;obituary for Indra Devi.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Indra Devi, the daughter of European nobility who introduced the ancient discipline of yoga to the Kremlin leadership, Hollywood stars like Gloria Swanson and even students in India, died on Thursday in Buenos Aires,&#x201d; the obit began. &#x201c;She was 102.&#x201d; The piece explained that she&#x2019;d learned from the same guru as B. K. S. Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, yoga masters I&#x2019;d heard about from serious students in India. It described her life as a Berlin cabaret performer and an&nbsp;actress in early Indian cinema. According to the obituary, she taught &#x201c;what was thought to be the first yoga class in modern China&#x201d; and wrote the first book on yoga by a Westerner to be published in India.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Indra Devi&#x2019;s story, I thought, I&#x2019;d find the answers I was lookingfor. So I began to trace the path of her strange, occasionally inscrutable, and often epic life. As I&#x2019;d hoped, that life does indeed give us a way to understand where yoga as we practice it in the West came from, showing both its links to an ancient Indian tradition and its wild discontinuities. It reveals how the discipline has been shaped by long dialogue among India, Europe, and America. In a strange way, following the serpentine tale of Devi&#x2019;s life and teachings resolved whatever anxiety I had had about modern yoga&#x2019;s authenticity, because it showed that there&#x2019;s never been a pristine, eternal tradition to corrupt.<br> &nbsp;<br> The narrative of Devi&#x2019;s life, however, is much more than the story of yoga in the West. As I dove into it, I felt that I was discovering a secret sideways history of the twentieth century. Devi was a Zelig-like figure, an esoteric female Forrest Gump who seemed to show up wherever tumultuous world events were unfolding. Her story moves through the Russian Revolution, the cabarets of Weimar Berlin, the Indian independence movement, the World War II Japanese occupation of Shanghai, and Hollywood during its 1950s heyday. She pops up, somewhat randomly, in Dallas when JFK was shot and then in Saigon when the Vietnam War was raging. That ashram I visited in Andhra Pradesh? It turns out that she was the one who spread Sai Baba&#x2019;s fame across the West. She crossed paths with Gandhi, Greta Garbo, and John Lennon. As spiritual adviser to Manuel Noriega&#x2019;s second-in-command, her name appears in most histories of the U.S. invasion of Panama.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s an astonishing story, and once I started trying to write it, I realized why no one had told it before. What source material exists is scattered in archives, old newspapers, government files, and friends&#x2019; houses all over the world. Some is in English, but some is in Russian,&nbsp;Czech, German, Polish, and Spanish, and the last is the only one of the languages in which I have any facility. Devi published several books, including, when she was one hundred, a Spanish-language memoir titled&nbsp;<i>Una mujer de tres siglos</i>, or &#x201c;A Woman of Three Centuries.&#x201d; Her autobiographical writing, however, is highly selective, full of large gaps. In her memoir, there are fewer than eight pages about her eight years in China. Some important incidents are ignored entirely.<br> &nbsp;<br> In parts of this book, I had no choice but to use Devi&#x2019;s own version of events as my guide. But I also dug up old letters and mentions of her in out-of-print books. I obtained her confidential FBI file&#x2014;J. Edgar Hoover, not surprisingly, had his eye on her&#x2014;and the service record of her diplomat first husband. I hired a researcher to help me navigate archives in Riga, Latvia, where she was born, and in Berlin. In addition to those countries, I traveled to India, Argentina, Mexico, and Panama. I spent a lot of money on professional translators, sometimes not knowing whether the material would be useful until after I read it in English. Even after all this, lacunae remain. Most of the people who knew Devi in life found her, on some level, ungraspable, and she remains elusive in death.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is partly because she had so many identities. Again and again, she would build a life for herself and then discard it when it no longer suited, moving on with no discernable effort or regret. You can see her talent for rebirth in how often she changed her name. Born Eugenia Peterson, she was also known as Eugenie and Jane, and later Indira and Indra, all in combination with various surnames. For her, constant openness to change was a spiritual precept, though it also marks her as a very modern sort of celebrity. (In the pages that follow, I will refer to her as Eugenia until she arrives in Hollywood and officially becomes Indra Devi.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Many people who knew her spoke to me, including two close friends who themselves had tried, unsuccessfully, to write the story of her life, and who generously shared everything they&#x2019;d learned. (A&nbsp;writer named Natalia Apostolli was finally able to produce a Spanish-language biography of Devi in 1992. Titled&nbsp;<i>Una vida, un siglo</i>, or &#x201c;One Life, One Century,&#x201d; it is based almost entirely on Devi&#x2019;s stories and recollections.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of those who loved her and who helped me will be disappointed in this book. To them, she was nearly divine. I see her as a complicated, audaciously modern, sometimes inspiring, and sometimes maddeningly irresponsible woman, not as a spiritual exemplar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Indeed, the more I learned about Devi, the more I doubted that her ethic of nonattachment, an idea often bandied about in yoga classes, was truly compatible with passionate loyalty to other people. In &#x201c;Reflections on Gandhi,&#x201d; published a year after the Mahatma&#x2019;s assassination, George Orwell writes, &#x201c;In this yogi-ridden age, it is too rea...</p><h2>The King&#39;s Two Bodies: A Study in Medieval Political Theology</h2><p><p>In 1957 Ernst Kantorowicz published a book that would be the guide for generations of scholars through the arcane mysteries of medieval political theology. In <i>The King's Two Bodies</i>, Kantorowicz traces the historical problem posed by the "King's two bodies"--the body politic and the body natural--back to the Middle Ages and demonstrates, by placing the concept in its proper setting of medieval thought and political theory, how the early-modern Western monarchies gradually began to develop a "political theology.?</p><p>The king's natural body has physical attributes, suffers, and dies, naturally, as do all humans; but the king's other body, the spiritual body, transcends the earthly and serves as a symbol of his office as majesty with the divine right to rule. The notion of the two bodies allowed for the continuity of monarchy even when the monarch died, as summed up in the formulation "The king is dead. Long live the king."</p><p> Bringing together liturgical works, images, and polemical material, <i>The King's Two Bodies</i> explores the long Christian past behind this "political theology." It provides a subtle history of how commonwealths developed symbolic means for establishing their sovereignty and, with such means, began to establish early forms of the nation-state.</p><p> Kantorowicz fled Nazi Germany in 1938, after refusing to sign a Nazi loyalty oath, and settled in the United States. While teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, he once again refused to sign an oath of allegiance, this one designed to identify Communist Party sympathizers. He was dismissed as a result of the controversy and moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he remained for the rest of his life, and where he wrote <i>The King's Two Bodies</i>.</p></p><p><b>Ernst H. Kantorowicz</b> taught at the University of California, Berkeley and was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey. His books include <i>Frederick the Second</i> and <i>Selected Studies</i>."Professor Kantorowicz has written a great book, perhaps the most important work in the history of medieval political thought, surely the most spectacular, of the past several generations. Here, in superbly designed chapters based upon the best scholarship in every field even remotely concerned with the Middle Ages, is the development of the theory and symbolism of the early national states from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries."<b>---P. N. Riesenberg, <i>American Political Science Review</i></b><br><br>"Professor Ernst Kantorowicz has in this volume given us a monumental work of superb scholarship and profound learning, magnificently produced by Princeton University Press. Few, if any, contributions to the study of medieval thought comparable to this depth and width have been made for many years."<b>---B.

Chuck Swindoll wants to show us that these men and women became great when they placed themselves at the Lord's disposal, allowing Him to develop within them the marks of true character: humility, purity, authenticity, and integrity.

With succinct clarity Kramer delivers additional spiritual tips from the author: Don&#39;t fight using your own strength--rely on the Lord. Don&#39;t abuse God&#39;s grace. Listen when God says no.

Can&#x2019;t you please feed them? Pretty please?&#x201d; Teasing, she ruffled his hair, and her bathrobe fell open. She left it open and smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll owe you one . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sue, I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He kissed her forehead distractedly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a meeting, I can&#x2019;t be late.&#x201d;<br><br>She sighed. &#x201c;Oh, all right.&#x201d; Pouting, she left.<br><br>Sanders began shaving.<br><br>A moment later he heard his wife say, &#x201c;Okay, kids, let&#x2019;s go! Eliza, put your shoes on.&#x201d; This was followed by whining from Eliza, who was four, and didn&#x2019;t like to wear shoes. Sanders had almost finished shaving when he heard, &#x201c;Eliza, you put on those shoes and take your brother downstairs right now!&#x201d; Eliza&#x2019;s reply was indistinct, and then Susan said, &#x201c;Eliza Ann, I&#x2019;m talking to you!&#x201d; Then Susan began slamming drawers in the hall linen closet. Both kids started to cry.<br><br>Eliza, who was upset by any display of tension, came into the bathroom, her face scrunched up, tears in her eyes. &#x201c;Daddy . . . ,&#x201d; she sobbed. He put his hand down to hug her, still shaving with his other hand.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s old enough to help out,&#x201d; Susan called, from the hallway.<br><br>&#x201c;Mommy,&#x201d; she wailed, clutching Sanders&#x2019;s leg.<br><br>&#x201c;Eliza, will you cut it out.&#x201d;<br><br>At this, Eliza cried more loudly. Susan stamped her foot in the hallway. Sanders hated to see his daughter cry. &#x201c;Okay, Sue, I&#x2019;ll feed them.&#x201d; He turned off the water in the sink and scooped up his daughter. &#x201c;Come on, Lize,&#x201d; he said, wiping away her tears. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get you some breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>He went out into the hallway. Susan looked relieved. &#x201c;I just need ten minutes, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Consuela is late again. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s the matter with her.&#x201d;<br><br>Sanders didn&#x2019;t answer her. His son, Matt, who was nine months old, sat in the middle of the hallway banging his rattle and crying. Sanders scooped him up in his other arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, kids,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go eat.&#x201d;<br><br>When he picked up Matt, his towel slipped off, and he clutched at it. Eliza giggled. &#x201c;I see your penis, Dad.&#x201d; She swung her foot, kicking it.<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t kick Daddy there,&#x201d; Sanders said. Awkwardly, he wrapped the towel around himself again, and headed downstairs.<br><br>Susan called after him: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget Matt needs vitamins in his cereal. One dropperful. And don&#x2019;t give him any more of the rice cereal, he spits it out. He likes wheat now.&#x201d; She went into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.<br><br>His daughter looked at him with serious eyes. &#x201c;Is this going to be one of those days, Daddy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it looks like it.&#x201d; He walked down the stairs, thinking he would miss the ferry and that he would be late for the first meeting of the day. Not very late, just a few minutes, but it meant he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to go over things with Stephanie before they started, but perhaps he could call her from the ferry, and then&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have a penis, Dad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Lize.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, Dad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just the way it is, honey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boys have penises, and girls have vaginas,&#x201d; she said solemnly.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, Dad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because.&#x201d; He dropped his daughter on a chair at the kitchen table, dragged the high chair from the corner, and placed Matt in it. &#x201c;What do you want for breakfast, Lize? Rice Krispies or Chex?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Chex.&#x201d;<br><br>Matt began to bang on his high chair with his spoon. Sanders got the Chex and a bowl out of the cupboard, then the box of wheat cereal and a smaller bowl for Matt. Eliza watched him as he opened the refrigerator to get the milk.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want Mommy to be happy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me too, honey.&#x201d;<br><br>He mixed the wheat cereal for Matt, and put it in front of his son. Then he set Eliza&#x2019;s bowl on the table, poured in the Chex, glanced at her. &#x201c;Enough?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>He poured the milk for her.<br><br>&#x201c;No, Dad!&#x201d; his daughter howled, bursting into tears. &#x201c;I wanted to pour the milk!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Lize&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take it out&#x2014;take the milk out&#x2014;&#x201d; She was shrieking, completely hysterical.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Lize, but this is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wanted to pour the milk!&#x201d; She slid off her seat to the ground, where she lay kicking her heels on the floor. &#x201c;Take it out, take the milk out!&#x201d;<br><br>His daughter did this kind of thing several times a day. It was, he was assured, just a phase. Parents were advised to treat it with firmness.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Sanders said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll just have to eat it, Lize.&#x201d; He sat down at the table beside Matt to feed him. Matt stuck his hand in his cereal and smeared it across his eyes. He, too, began to cry.<br><br>Sanders got a dish towel to wipe Matt&#x2019;s face. He noticed that the kitchen clock now said five to eight. He thought that he&#x2019;d better call the office, to warn them he would be late. But he&#x2019;d have to quiet Eliza first: she was still on the floor, kicking and screaming about the milk. &#x201c;All right, Eliza, take it easy. Take it easy.&#x201d; He got a fresh bowl, poured more cereal, and gave her the carton of milk to pour herself. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br><br>She crossed her arms and pouted. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eliza, you pour that milk this minute.&#x201d;<br><br>His daughter scrambled up to her chair. &#x201c;Okay, Dad.&#x201d;<br><br>Sanders sat down, wiped Matt&#x2019;s face, and began to feed his son. The boy immediately stopped crying, and swallowed the cereal in big gulps. The poor kid was hungry. Eliza stood on her chair, lifted the milk carton, and splashed it all over the table. &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; With one hand, he wiped the table with the dish towel, while with the other he continued to feed Matt.<br><br>Eliza pulled the cereal box right up to her bowl, stared fixedly at the picture of Goofy on the back, and began to eat. Alongside her, Matt ate steadily. For a moment, it was calm in the kitchen.<br><br>Sanders glanced over his shoulder: almost eight o&#x2019;clock. He should call the office.<br><br>Susan came in, wearing jeans and a beige sweater. Her face was relaxed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I lost it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Thanks for taking over.&#x201d; She kissed him on the cheek.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you happy, Mom?&#x201d; Eliza said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sweetie.&#x201d; Susan smiled at her daughter, and turned back to Tom. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take over now. You don&#x2019;t want to be late. Isn&#x2019;t today the big day? When they announce your promotion?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Call me as soon as you hear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d; Sanders got up, cinched the towel around his waist, and headed upstairs to get dressed. There was always traffic in town before the 8:20 ferry. He would have to hurry to make it.<br><br>He parked in his spot behind Ricky&#x2019;s Shell station, and strode quickly down the covered walkway to the ferry. He stepped aboard moments before they pulled up the ramp. Feeling the throb of the engines beneath his feet, he went through the doors onto the main deck.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Tom.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked over his shoulder. Dave Benedict was coming up behind him. Benedict was a lawyer with a firm that handled a lot of high-tech companies. &#x201c;Missed the seven-fifty, too, huh?&#x201d; Benedict said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Crazy morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me. I wanted to be in the office an hour ago. But now that school&#x2019;s out, Jenny doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with the kids until camp starts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Madness at my house,&#x201d; Benedict said, shaking his head.<br><br>There was a pause. Sanders sensed that he and Benedict had had a similar morning. But the two men did not discuss it further. Sanders often wondered why it was that women discussed the most intimate details of their marriages with their friends, while men maintained a discreet silence with one another.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Benedict said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Susan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine. She&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br><br>Benedict grinned. &#x201c;So why are you limping?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Company touch football game on Saturday. Got a little out of hand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you get for playing with children,&#x201d; Benedict said. DigiCom was famous for its young employees.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Sanders said. &#x201c;I scored.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Damn right. Winning touchdown. Crossed the end zone in glory. And then I got creamed.&#x201d;<br><br>At the main-deck cafeteria, they stood in line for coffee. &#x201c;Actually, I would&#x2019;ve thought you&#x2019;d be in bright and early today,&#x201d; Benedict said. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this the big day at DigiCom?&#x201d;<br><br>Sanders got his coffee, and stirred in sweetener. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t the merger being announced today?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What merger?&#x201d; Sanders said blandly. The merger was secret; only a handful of DigiCom executives knew anything about it. He gave Benedict a blank stare.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Benedict said. &#x201c;I heard it was pretty much wrapped up. And that Bob Garvin was announcing the restructuring today, including a bunch of new promotions.&#x201d; Benedict sipped his coffee. &#x201c;Garvin is stepping down, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>Sanders shrugged. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; Of course Benedict was imposing on him, but Susan did a lot of work with attorneys in Benedict&#x2019;s firm; Sanders couldn&#x2019;t afford to be rude. It was one of the new complexities of business relations at a time when everybody had a working spouse.<br><br>The two men went out on the deck and stood by the port rail, watching the houses of Bainbridge Island slip away. Sanders nodded toward the house on Wing Point, which for years had been Warren Magnuson&#x2019;s summer house when he was senator.<br><br>&#x201c;I hear it just sold again,&#x201d; Sanders said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes? Who bought it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some California asshole.&#x201d;<br><br>Bainbridge slid to the stern. They looked out at the gray water of the Sound. The coffee steamed in the morning sunlight. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; Benedict said. &#x201c;You think maybe Garvin won&#x2019;t step down?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody knows,&#x201d; Sanders said. &#x201c;Bob built the company from nothing, fifteen years ago. When he started, he was selling knockoff modems from Korea. Back when nobody knew what a modem was. Now the company&#x2019;s got three buildings downtown, and big facilities in California, Texas, Ireland, and Malaysia. He builds fax modems the size of a dime, he markets fax and E-mail software, he&#x2019;s gone into CD-ROMs, and he&#x2019;s developed proprietary algorithms that should make him a leading provider in education markets for the next century. Bob&#x2019;s come a long way from some guy hustling three hundred baud modems. I don&#x2019;t know if he can give it up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t the terms of the merger require it?&#x201d;<br><br>Sanders smiled. &#x201c;If you know about a merger, Dave, you should tell me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Because I haven&#x2019;t heard anything.&#x201d; The truth was that Sanders didn&#x2019;t really know the terms of the impending merger. His work involved the development of CD-ROMs and electronic databases. Although these were areas vital to the future of the company&#x2014;they were the main reason Conley-White was acquiring DigiCom&#x2014;they were essentially technical areas. And Sanders was essentially a technical manager. He was not informed about decisions at the highest levels.<br><br>For Sanders, there was some irony in this. In earlier years, when he was based in California, he had been closely involved in management decisions. But since coming to Seattle eight years ago, he had been more removed from the centers of power.<br><br>Benedict sipped his coffee. &#x201c;Well, I hear Bob&#x2019;s definitely stepping down, and he&#x2019;s going to promote a woman as chairman.&#x201d;<br><br>Sanders said, &#x201c;Who told you that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s already got a woman as CFO, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sure. For a long time, now.&#x201d; Stephanie Kap�lan was DigiCom&#x2019;s chief financial officer. But it seemed unlikely she would ever run the company. Silent and intense, Kap�lan was competent, but disliked by many in the company. Garvin wasn&#x2019;t especially fond of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Benedict said, &#x201c;the rumor I&#x2019;ve heard is he&#x2019;s going to name a woman to take over within five years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does the rumor mention a name?&#x201d;<br><br>Benedict shook his head. &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d know. I mean, it&#x2019;s your company.&#x201d;</p><h2>As We Have Always Done: Indigenous Freedom through Radical Resistance (Indigenous Americas)</h2><p><p><b>Winner: Native American and Indigenous Studies Association's Best&nbsp;Subsequent Book 2017<br> Honorable Mention:&nbsp;Labriola Center American Indian National Book Award 2017</b></p><p><br> Across North America, Indigenous acts of resistance have in recent years opposed the removal of federal protections for forests and waterways in Indigenous lands, halted the expansion of tar sands extraction and the pipeline construction at Standing Rock, and demanded justice for murdered and missing Indigenous women. In <i>As We Have Always Done</i>, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson locates Indigenous political resurgence as a practice rooted in uniquely Indigenous theorizing, writing, organizing, and thinking.</p><p>Indigenous resistance is a radical rejection of contemporary colonialism focused around the refusal of the dispossession of both Indigenous bodies and land. Simpson makes clear that its goal can no longer be cultural resurgence as a mechanism for inclusion in a multicultural mosaic. Instead, she calls for unapologetic, place-based Indigenous alternatives to the destructive logics of the settler colonial state, including heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalist exploitation.</p></p><p><p>Leanne Betasamosake Simpson is a writer, activist, faculty member at the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning, and a Distinguished Visiting Professor in the Faculty of Arts at Ryerson University.

She is Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg, holds a PhD from the University of Manitoba, and is a member of Alderville First Nation.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is an astonishing work of Indigenous intellectualism and activism&#x2014;by far the most provocative, defiant, visionary, and generous of Leanne Betasamosake Simpson's impressive corpus to date."&#x2014;Daniel Heath Justice (Cherokee Nation), University of British Columbia</p><p>"I have learned more about this battered world from reading Leanne Betasamosake Simpson than from almost any writer alive today. A dazzlingly original thinker and an irresistible stylist, Simpson has gifted us with a field guide not to mere political resistance but to deep and holistic transformation. It arrives at the perfect time."&#x2014;Naomi Klein, author of <i>The Shock Doctrine</i> and <i>This Changes Everything</i></p><p>"A remarkable achievement that illuminates what is possible when we engage in the revolutionary act of indigenous self-love, <i>As We Have Always Done</i> asks the simple question, &#x2018;What if no one sided with colonialism?&#x2019; The many possible answers to that question are reflected in Leanne Betasamosake Simpson&#x2019;s beautifully written book in which she kindly challenges indigenous people to reclaim their lives and bodies from the settler colonial state."&#x2014;Sarah Deer (Muscogee [Creek] Nation), author of <i>The Beginning and End of Rape</i></p><p>"Incisive. Unmitigated. Inspiring. Simpson gives no quarter to colonialism. No quarter to a nasty Western narrative. She provides a pure, Indigenous lens&#x2014;a lens that the white man tried to kill and bury. This book is a reminder that they failed in that rotten endeavor. It belongs on every Canadian bookshelf. On every American coffee table. Simpson's words are an affirmation of Indigenous resilience and resolve."&#x2014;Simon Moya-Smith (Lakota and Chicano), culture editor at Indian Country Media Network</p><br><br><p>"Leanne Betasamosake Simpson confronts colonialism from the perspective of indigenous nationhood, but goes beyond arguing for changes in politics, writing in a way that enacts changes in our thinking about politics."&#x2014;<i>Indian Country Today</i></p><p>"While her intended audience is other Indigenous peoples, I think non-Indigenous Canadians will find it inspiring as they take up her challenge of decolonization."&#x2014;<i>Watershed Sentinel</i></p><p>"<i>As We Have Always Done</i> is an in-depth look into indigenous resistance and what is possible when that resistance embraces indigenous culture. It gives us a glimmer of hope. Hope that there is another way to live.

The world desperately needs Christians whose actions match their convictions. A young generation is rising up, and they need to see the power of the gospel working its way out into our everyday lives. Enter James, the half-brother of Jesus. Be warned, everything is on the table. James will call us to evaluate the way we deal with hardship, handle money, use our words, and plan our futures. But if we will let him in, James's letter has the potential for our outside to match our inside, our activity to match our God-given identity.</p><p>Join author Ben Stuart as he unfolds the teachings of James, who went from skeptic to believer. Just as James came face-to-face with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, he wants the same for you&#x2015;whether you're wondering what being a Christian is all about or you've been following Christ for years. What James knew then still holds true today. When we encounter Jesus, He will change everything.

SHE WRITES &#34;This book was inspired by a nearly 300 -year-old story that was told to me by my Kabbalah teacher. It is about the power of words. And how we must choose them carefully to avoid causing harm to others.&#34; THE STORY CENTERS AROUND A TEACHER WHO APPARENTLY TAKES APPLES FROM A LOCAL MERCHANT WITHOUT PAYING FOR THEM. AND THE BOY WHO MISJUDGES THE SITUATION BECAUSE HE DOESN&#39;T HAVE ALL THE FACTS. MAKES YOU THINK!</p><p></p><h2>Dr. Death</h2><p>Who killed the killer? In his brilliant and startling new novel, Jonathan Kellerman, perennial bestselling author and premier proprietor of the psychological thriller, gives a sharp and timely twist to homicide's central question.<br><br>Someone has murdered euthanasia champion Dr. Eldon Mate--a self-styled Dr. Death responsible for scores of assisted suicides. In a burst of bloody irony, the killer chooses to dispatch the doctor in the back of Mate's own suicide van, hooking him up to the killing apparatus dubbed "the Humanitron"--and adding some butchering touches of his own. The case is assigned to veteran LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis, who turns, once again, to his friend Dr. Alex Delaware. But working this case raises a conflict of interest for Alex so profound that he can't even discuss it with Milo. The tension that develops between cop and psychologist further complicates an already baffling and complex murder investigation--one whose suspects include the families of Dr. Mate's "travelers," Mate's own son, and a psychopathic killer who relishes the geometry of death. <br><br>Dr. Death is a rich brew of unforgettable characters, labyrinthine plotting, page-turning prose, and the unique insights into the darkest corners of the human mind that have earned Jonathan Kellerman international accolades as the master of psychological suspense.<br></p><p>Dr. Eldon Mate, a.k.a. Dr. Death, has been the bane of the Los Angeles D.A.'s existence, the b�te noir of all opposed to assisted suicide, and the angel of mercy to countless "travelers" who have gone to their reward via Mate's good offices. He's also turned up in the back of his van, attached to his own death-dealing "Humanitron" machine and too far away from most of his blood and a certain external organ.<p> Enter Milo Sturgis, L.A.'s only openly gay homicide detective, and for the 14th time in 15 years (1985's Edgar-winning <i>When the Bough Breaks</i> through 1999's <i>Monster</i>), enter also his good friend, child psychologist and LAPD consultant Dr. Alex Delaware. Unbeknownst to Sturgis, however, is a potentially case-stymieing doctor-patient conflict of interest. One of Delaware's young patients' mother was either the beneficiary or victim of Dr. Death's services, depending upon your point of view. The father, Richard Doss, is firmly in the latter camp, giving Delaware ample pause: </p><blockquote>After hearing the details of the murder, I felt better. The butchery didn't seem like Richard's style. Though how sure of that could I be? Richard hadn't disclosed any more about himself than he'd wanted to. In control, always in control. One of those people who crowds every room he enters. Maybe that had been part of what led his wife to seek out Eldon Mate.</blockquote> Maybe. But the fact is that there's no shortage of motivated suspects from both within and without the late doctor's circle of influence. And as usual, Jonathan Kellerman (himself a child psychologist and recognized authority in childhood psycho-pathology) guides Delaware's engaging first-person narrative with expertise, keeps Detective Sturgis real, and rudders his taut story to its satisfying end with sharp, true-to-the-ear dialogue. With <i>Dr. Death</i>, Kellerman's legion of Delaware fans will be very well pleased, and first-timers will almost certainly join the legion. <i>--Michael Hudson</i>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Cleopatra</h2><p>story of Cleopatra</p><p></p><h2>From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine</h2><p>Dispells the myth that Arabs and Jews lived together peacefully in former days in the Arab countries and examines Jewish and Arab immigration patterns</p><p>Joan Peters has written and lectured widely on the Middle East, Central America, and the Soviet Union.

Grimm's fairy tale is familiar, but the subtlety, respect, and mystery of this new version are unique, as are the depth of characterization and plot. Barrett's rich, gorgeous illustrations serve as a stunning backdrop to the reinvented drama, and contribute to the more sophisticated feel of this rendition. The seven dwarfs, for example, are not depicted as freakish slow-witted anomalies; they are simply small, kind men. One of the most haunting images of the book is of Snow White running through the dark forest, translucent white gown flowing, scratches from the brambles barely visible on her legs, wild animals racing along beside her as comrades and protectors.</p><p> This British author-illustrator pair also collaborated on the highly acclaimed <i>Joan of Arc</i>. Barrett's illustrations (also seen in <i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i> and other books) have an elegant, luminescent appeal, ideal for the romance of a fairy tale. Readers of any age will be mesmerized by the exquisite interweaving of Poole and Barrett's art. (Ages 5 to 10) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>"Echoing the central image of this classic tale of contrasts--good and evil, innocence and cruelty, youth and age, beauty and ugliness of spirit--Barrett's images unfold in a twilight world of ethereal beauty anchored by telling detail. Poole's version remains faithful to the original and enchants with its unassuming prose. This is a fairy tale in the grand tradition and an exemplary marriage of illustration and narrative."--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"A sophisticated version that could inspire discussion in an older audience as well as among primary graders."--The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books<br><br>"A splendid work, with the flavor of eighteenth-century German Romanticism." --The Horn Book (starred review),a Fanfare Honor Book<br><br>"Graceful...intriguing...elegant."-- Kirkus Reviews (pointer review)</p><h2>A New Eusebius: Documents Illustrating the History of the Church to Ad 337</h2><p>A source book for students of the patristic period and a companion volume to &#34;Creeds, Councils and Controversies&#34; and &#34;Doctrine and Practice in the Early Church&#34; This updated edition incorporates vital documents that were not available when the original collection was compiled.</p><p>J.

In <i>The Healing Power of Sound, </i> he presents his sound-based techniques for self-healing&#x2014;techniques that anyone can use, whether faced with a life-threatening disease or simply seeking relief from the stresses of daily life. <br><br>Numerous studies have demonstrated the health benefits of music: it can lower blood pressure and heart and respiratory rates; reduce cardiac complications; increase the immune response; and boost our natural opiates. Gaynor shows how, when integrated as part of a mind-body-spirit approach to wellness, music can play a significant part in maintaining a healthy lifestyle or in healing serious disease. <i>The Healing Power of Sound </i> includes twelve exercises involving breathing, meditation, and "toning"&#x2014;using pure vocal sound to resolve tension, release emotion, and spur the healing process&#x2014;that can be used by anyone to improve health and quality of life.</p><p>Mitchell L.

The text, written by the late Millen Brand, illuminates the history of the Pennsylvania German sects who were united in their rejection of infant baptism. He provides a sympathetic portrait of these fascinating people (often erroneously called "Pennsylvania Dutch") who emigrated from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, found a home in the sympathetic commonwealth of William Penn, and settled primarily in and around Lancaster County. Primarily Amish and Mennonites, these are quiet and modest people whose lives of determined simplicity and whose passion for land seem totally anomalous in modern America. They continue to live lives of determined simplicity and agrarian focus that have all but disappeared.<br><br>The photographs by George Tice are some of the most compelling documentary imagery ever framed. In their unobtrusive vision, they capture the substance and the spirit of these self-reliant people. They also reflect over thirty years of gentle but persistent efforts to document their lives and record their customs. For George Tice, this has been a life work, and the breadth and generosity of his vision is manifest on every page.<br><br>First published in 1970 and here entirely reset with 39 new images added and every photograph reshot for duotone reproduction (as well as a new foreword by Sue Bender and a new afterword by Tice), this is not a "revised edition" but an entirely new book; one that will surely take its place among the classic documentary works of this century.</p><p>A welcome, dramatically updated reissue of a classic photo-essay originally published in 1970, this portrait of the Amish and Mennonite Pennsylvania German communities is a treasure for lovers of photography and Americana. In a new afterword describing his 1990 return trip to the region, Tice notes that he found the simplicity-loving way of life of these self-reliant folk still largely intact. This revised edition features 39 new photographs and a duotone format that adds warmth and intimacy to the wonderfully evocative pictures, inviting one to linger over such scenes as a horse and buggy silhouetted against open sky, an auction, a prayer meeting, kids with wide-brimmed hats playing in the snow, sheep enveloped in fog and pristine farmhouses. Tice's spare, quiet, yet stunning photos capture an underlying sense of order and purpose. Novelist/screenwriter Brand, who died in 1980, was on intimate terms with the Pennsylvania Germans (often mistakenly called "Pennsylvania Dutch"). His perceptive text examines their deeply ingrained customs: independent small farming (in some areas, tobacco is the cash crop); aversion to government and secretive courtships; and evening get-togethers for singing and storytelling. Brand records uninhibited conversations with a foundry worker, a beekeeper, a horse trader, an international medical volunteer. The whole album exudes an inner radiance, managing to transcend idyllic sentimentality to become a sociological document. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Creepy Cute Crochet: Zombies, Ninjas, Robots, and More!</h2><p>Attack of the Cute!<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Creepy Cute Crochet </i>features more than 20 unique patterns for totally loveable zombies, ninjas, Vikings, vampires, aliens, robots, and even Death himself.

From the most upscale restaurants in New York to humble farm stays in Europe, chefs and restaurant-goers alike are seeking pleasure in food found in the wild.</p><p></p><p></p><p> <i>In Pursuit of Wild Edibles: A Forager&#x2019;s Tour</i> tells the story of one man passionate about finding wild edibles and creating recipes to highlight their unique flavors. An American expatriate, poet, and gourmet living in France, Jeffrey Greene has scoured the fields, rivers, and beaches of Europe and his native New England in search of foods ranging from puffballs and periwinkles to stone pine nuts and gooseneck barnacles. For many, foraging is the latest trend in foodie culture, but for Greene this journey stretches back to his childhood, when his parents fled New York City to a shack-like house in rural Connecticut. Convinced they could live off the land, the family raised goats, planted gardens, gathered seafood at the nearby coast, and foraged for food from the woods. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Inspired by these childhood experiences, Greene and his wife, Mary, bought and restored an old priory in rural Burgundy. Surrounded by forests, they learned to identify mushrooms and greens, and devoted themselves to inventing recipes for them. Thus began a pursuit that took Greene to the Polish Carpathians, the Appennines overlooking the Ligurian coast, the shores of Normandy and Brittany, and to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where the Pilgrims eked out their first winter in near starvation.</p> <p></p><p></p><p>Greene&#x2019;s captivating book offers experienced foragers and novices alike an extensive sampling of his own recipes and a chance to come along with him on his international adventures. From razor clams and wild sea urchins, to young nettles and dandelion greens, to wild strawberries and cherries, Greene showcases the beauty of what one can cook up in a truly wild recipe. </p><p></p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Greene is the author of <i>French Spirits: A House, a Village, and a Love Affair with Burgundy</i> and <i>The Golden-Bristled Boar: Last Ferocious Beast of the Forest</i> (Virginia). A widely published poet, he is the recipient of the Samuel French Morse Poetry Prize and the Randall Jarrell Award in Poetry. He teaches at the American University of Paris.</p>Jeffery Greene is on a quest to see value where the rest of the world sees weeds..... More than a guidebook, or a colorful narrative, his book is a meditation, with elegant musings.... You leave Mr. Greene's book wanting to find joy in fewer, more tangible things.... As you make your way through his 'meditation' you realize this sentiment is not just an aspiration for life, but as Thoreau pointed out, an inevitability for all living things.<br>Wall Street Journal</p><h2>Crazy Rich Asians (Crazy Rich Asians Trilogy)</h2><p><b>"There's rich, there's filthy rich, and then there's crazy rich . . . A <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>-like send-up about an heir bringing his Chinese-American girlfriend home to meet his ancestor-obsessed family, the book hilariously skewers imperial splendor and the conniving antics of the Asians jet set." --<i>People&nbsp;</i><br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of Hong Kong Tatler; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> is an insider's look at the Asian Jet Set, a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money, between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese, and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, disgustingly rich.</p><p>Born and raised in Singapore, KEVIN KWAN has worked for <i>Martha Stewart Living</i> and <i>Interview Magazine</i> and in 1998 joined M&amp;Co, where he developed commercial and cultural projects for such clients as The Museum of Modern Art, <i>Vitra</i>, and<i> The New York Times</i>.

She paused, thinking Nick might invite her in for a drink, but no invitation seemed forthcoming. Finally she said as nonchalantly as possible, &#x201c;This is quite a place&#x2014;is it your grandmother&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nick replied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Has she lived here a long time?&#x201d; Peik Lin asked, craning to get a better look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Since she was a young girl.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Peik Lin really wanted to ask was,&nbsp;<i>Who on earth is your grandmother?</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, you two have a great time,&#x201d; she said instead, winking at Rachel and mouthing&nbsp;<i>Call me later.</i>&nbsp;Rachel gave her friend a quick smile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick turned to Rachel, looking a little sheepish. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s OK . . . but it&#x2019;s not just the family. My grandmother decided to have a small party at the last minute because her&nbsp;<i>tan hua</i>&nbsp;flowers are going to bloom tonight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s throwing a party because some flowers are in bloom?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, these are very rare. They bloom only about once every decade, and only at night. The whole thing lasts just a few hours. It&#x2019;s quite something.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sounds cool, but now I&#x2019;m feeling really underdressed,&#x201d; Rachel said, eyeing the fleet of limousines lining the driveway. She was wearing a sleeveless, chocolate-colored linen dress, a pair of low-heeled sandals, and the only expensive piece of jewelry she owned&#x2014;Mikimoto pearl studs that her mother had given her when she got her doctorate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not at all&#x2014;you look absolutely perfect,&#x201d; Nick replied.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they entered the house, Rachel was transfixed for a few moments by the intricate black, blue, and coral mosaic tile pattern on the floor of what appeared to be a large foyer. Then, to her amazement, a tall, spindly Indian man standing next to a table clustered with pots of enormous white-and-purple phalaenopsis orchids bowed ceremoniously to her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s upstairs in the living room,&#x201d; Nick said, leading Rachel toward a carved-stone staircase. She saw something out of the corner of her eye and let out a quick gasp. By the side of the staircase lurked a huge tiger, mouth open in a ferocious growl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It looks so real!&#x201d; Rachel said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;real,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a native Singaporean tiger. They used to roam this area. My great-grandfather shot it when it ran into the house and hid under the billiard table, or so the story goes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Poor guy,&#x201d; Rachel said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It used to scare the hell out of me when I was little. I never dared go near the foyer at night,&#x201d; Nick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You grew up here?&#x201d; Rachel asked in surprise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, until I was about seven.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You never told me you lived in a palace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a palace. It&#x2019;s just a big house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nick, where I come from, this is a palace,&#x201d; Rachel said, gazing up at the cast-iron-and-glass cupola soaring above them. The murmur of party chatter and piano keys wafted down. As they entered the drawing room, Rachel felt momentarily giddy, as if she had been transported back in time to the grand lounge of a twenties ocean liner, en route from Venice to Istanbul, perhaps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#x201c;living room,&#x201d; as Nick so modestly called it, was a gallery that ran along the entire northern end of the house, with Art Deco divans, wicker club chairs, and ottomans casually grouped into intimate seating areas. A row of tall plantation doors opened onto a veranda, inviting a view of verdant parklands and the scent of night-blooming jasmine into the room. At the far end of the room a young man in a tuxedo played on a B�sendorfer grand piano. Rachel longed to study every exquisite detail: the exotic potted palms in massive Qianlong dragon jardinieres, the lacquered teak surfaces, the silver-and-lapis-lazuli-filigreed walls. The glamorous guests, she couldn&#x2019;t help noticing, appeared completely at ease lounging on the shantung silk ottomans while a retinue of white-gloved servants circulated with trays of cocktails.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Here comes my cousin Astrid&#x2019;s mother,&#x201d; Nick muttered. A stately-&nbsp;looking lady approached them, wagging a finger at Nick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nicky, you naughty boy, why didn&#x2019;t you tell us you were back?&#x201d; The woman spoke in a clipped English accent straight out of a Merchant Ivory film. Rachel couldn&#x2019;t help but notice how her tightly permed black hair fittingly resembled the Queen of England&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So sorry, I thought you and Uncle Harry would be in London at this time of the year.&nbsp;<i>Dai gu cheh</i>, this is my girlfriend, Rachel Chu. Rachel, this is my auntie Felicity Leong.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicity nodded at Rachel, boldly scanning her up and down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So nice to meet you,&#x201d; Rachel said, unsettled by her hawklike gaze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is Astrid here yet?&#x201d; Nick asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Aiyah</i>, you know that girl is always late!&#x201d; At that moment, his aunt noticed an elderly Indian woman in a gold-and-peacock-blue sari being helped up the stairs. &#x201c;Dear Mrs. Singh, when did you get back from Udaipur?&#x201d; she screeched, pouncing on the woman as Nick guided Rachel out of the way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who is that lady?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mrs. Singh, a family friend who used to live down the street. She&#x2019;s the daughter of a maharaja and was great friends with Nehru. I&#x2019;ll introduce you later, when my aunt isn&#x2019;t breathing down our necks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Her sari is absolutely stunning,&#x201d; Rachel remarked, gazing at the elaborate gold stitching.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I hear she flies all her saris back to New Delhi to be specially cleaned,&#x201d; Nick said as he tried to escort Rachel toward the bar, unwittingly steering her into the path of a very posh-looking middle-aged couple. The man had a pompadour of Brylcreemed black hair while his wife wore a classic gold-buttoned red-and-white Chanel suit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Uncle Dickie, Auntie Nancy, meet my girlfriend, Rachel Chu,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;Rachel, this is my uncle and his wife, from the T&#x2019;sien side of the family.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, Rachel, I&#x2019;ve met your grandfather in Taipei . . . Chu Yang Chung, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Uncle Dickie asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Er . . . actually, no. My family isn&#x2019;t from Taipei,&#x201d; Rachel stammered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh. Where are they from, then?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Guangdong originally, and nowadays California.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Dickie looked a bit taken aback, while his well-coiffed wife grasped his arm tightly and continued. &#x201c;Oh, we know California very well. Northern California, actually.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from,&#x201d; Rachel replied politely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, well then, you must know the Gettys? Ann is a great friend of mine,&#x201d; Nancy effused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Um, are you referring to the Getty Oil family?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is there any other?&#x201d; Nancy asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rachel&#x2019;s from Cupertino, not San Francisco, Auntie Nancy. And that&#x2019;s why I need to introduce her to Francis Leong over there, who I hear is going to Stanford this fall,&#x201d; Nick cut in, quickly moving Rachel along. The next half hour was a blur of nonstop greetings, as Rachel was introduced to aunties and uncles and cousins, the distinguished though diminutive Thai ambassador, and the sultan of some unpronounceable Malay state, along with his two wives in bejeweled head scarves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One woman seemed to command the attention of the room. She was very slim and aristocratic-looking with snow-white hair and ramrod-straight posture, dressed in a long white silk cheongsam. Most of the guests orbited around her, paying tribute, and when she at last came toward them, Rachel noticed Nick&#x2019;s resemblance to her. Rachel decided to greet her in Mandarin, but before Nick could make proper introductions, she bowed her head nervously and said, &#x201c;It is such a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for inviting me to your beautiful home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman looked at her quizzically and replied slowly in Mandarin, &#x201c;It is a pleasure to meet you, too, but you are mistaken; this is not my house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rachel, this is my great-aunt Rosemary,&#x201d; Nick explained hurriedly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll have to forgive me, my Mandarin is really quite rusty,&#x201d; Great-Aunt Rosemary added in a Vanessa Redgrave English.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Rachel said, her cheeks flushing bright red. She could feel all eyes in the room upon her, amused by her faux pas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No need to apologize.&#x201d; Great-Aunt Rosemary smiled graciously. &#x201c;Nick has told me quite a bit about you, and I was so looking forward to meeting you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick put his arm around Rachel and said, &#x201c;Here, come meet my grandmother.&#x201d; They walked across the room, and on the sofa closest to the veranda sat an older woman dressed simply in a rose-colored silk blouse and tailored cream trousers, her steel-gray hair held in place by an ivory headband. Standing behind her were two ladies in immaculate matching gowns of iridescent silk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick addressed his grandmother in Cantonese. &#x201c;<i>Ah ma</i>, I&#x2019;d like you to meet my friend Rachel Chu, from America.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So nice to meet you!&#x201d; Rachel blurted, forgetting her Mandarin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick&#x2019;s grandmother peered up at Rachel. &#x201c;Thank you for coming,&#x201d; she replied haltingly, in English, before turning to resume her conversation with a woman at her side. The two ladies swathed in silk stared inscrutably at Rachel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get some punch,&#x201d; Nick said, directing Rachel toward a table dominated by a huge Venetian glass punch bowl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That had to be the most awkward moment of my life,&#x201d; Rachel whispered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nonsense. She was just in the middle of another conversation,&#x201d; Nick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who were those two elegant women in matching silk dresses standing like statues behind her?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Her lady&#x2019;s maids. They never leave her side. They&#x2019;re from Thailand and were trained to serve in the royal court.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is this a common thing in Singapore? Importing royal maids from Thailand?&#x201d; Rachel asked incredulously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe so. This service was a special lifetime gift to my grandmother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A gift? From whom?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The King of Thailand.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Rachel said. She took the glass of punch from Nick and noticed that the fine etching on the Venetian glassware perfectly matched the intricate fretwork pattern on the ceiling. She leaned against the back of a sofa for support.There was so much for her to take in. Who knew that Nick&#x2019;s family would turn out to be so grand? And why hadn&#x2019;t he prepared her better?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see Nick&#x2019;s cousin, Astrid Leong, holding a sleepy toddler. &#x201c;Astrid!&#x201d; she cried, delighted to see a friendly face. Astrid was wearing the chicest outfit Rachel had ever seen&#x2014;an embroidered Alexis Mabille white peasant blouse, pearl-gray Lanvin cigarette pants, and a fantastical pair of bejeweled earrings, very Millicent Rogers. So this was Astrid in her natural habitat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hello, hello!&#x201d; Astrid said cheerily. &#x201c;Cassian, say hi to Auntie Rachel.&#x201d; The child stared at Rachel, then buried his head into his mother&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;how are you finding Singapore so far? Having a good time?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A great time! Although tonight&#x2019;s been a bit . . . overwhelming.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can only imagine,&#x201d; Astrid said with a knowing glint in her eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melodious peal rang out. An elderly woman in a white cheongsam top and black silk trousers was playing a small silver xylophone by the stairs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, the dinner gong,&#x201d; Astrid said. &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s eat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nb...</p></p><h2>Carving Grand Canyon: Evidence, Theories, and Mystery</h2><p><i>Carving Grand Canyon</i> provides a synopsis of the intriguing ideas and innovative theories that geologists have developed over time.

Three 15-year-old friends, Scott, Raoul and Joseph, are sent to reform school for the same crime. Bleda Reformatory has no bars on its windows, no fences, one 5:30 vp.m. roll call. All of the other boys are images of gentility, for Mr. Hall, "the Principal," returns only gentlemen to society. That preeminent conclusion ends with Scott, Joseph and Raoul. Joseph is mysteriously killed the first day; that night Raoul is raped. Too ashamed to tell anyone, he is pushed mentally towards amoral and animalistic reasoning. Finally, he sublimely pressures the residents to perpetrate criminal acts (arson, rape, pet killing), causing so much havoc that Mr. Hall is chased from his model school in fear for his life. While Golding's boys are reunited with society, Galgut's two "friends" are still together in reform school, although it is not made clear whether they are to remain together; that decision is up to Raoul. A powerful story of inner pain and peer/environmental pressures.

Reprint.</p><p>Wolfe's first novel since Pandora by Holly Hollander (1990) is a vivid and compelling evocation of life inside an interstellar spacecraft so huge that a whole world of cities and wildernesses exists within it, and so old that its origins and purpose are mere legends to its inhabitants. Patera Silk, a young priest in one of the city of Viron's poorest temples ("manteions"), receives a mental message from one of his gods, an enlightenment which invests his life with urgent meaning. On the same day, however, he learns his manteion had been sold for back taxes and may well be dismantled. Armed with the conviction of his revelation, Silk enlists the aid of a local but decent-hearted thief, intent upon breaking into the mansion of Blod, the new owner of the manteion, to convince (or even force) him to guarantee its survival. From that point on, Silk is drawn even deeper into the shady world outside his temple walls. But for all its interest, the plot is hardly the most powerful element. The atmosphere of Wolfe's spacecraft seduces and amazes, details and mystery piling upon each other to yield a sense of palpable otherworldliness. The environment of the long sun--so called because the ship's cylindrical interior is lit by a central tubular "sun" extending the length of the ship--comes energetically alive, and readers will be grateful that this book begins a four-volume series. If this first taste is any test, Wolfe has embarked on an epic to rival his acclaimed Book of the New Sun. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The first installment in another multivolume, far-future saga (like Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy, 1980-87), set inside...well, something--a supercolossal spaceship? a ringworld? a Dyson sphere?--that has its own sun, seasons, and a land surface that curves up in the distance to form the sky; until recently, this world's numerous ruling gods communicated with humans via ``Sacred Windows'' from their remote Mainframe home. Here, in a poor, decaying section of the city Viron, augur and religious leader Patera Silk receives enlightenment from a god, the Outsider, only to learn that his temple has been sold in lieu of unpaid taxes to the rich businessman Blood. Somehow, Silk must persuade Blood not to demolish the temple and redevelop the neighborhood. So Silk breaks into Blood's heavily defended villa, intending threats or bluff; after various weird incidents, Silk sustains a broken ankle and obtains Blood's undertaking to sell the temple back to Silk for twice the original price. Silk also agrees to exorcise Blood's bordello--the scene of a number of unpleasant and ultimately murderous hauntings. A typically unsettling, utterly mysterious blend of sacrifice, spies, exorcism, cyborgs, ghosts, androids, robots, genetic engineering, gods, computers, and what-all. The clever plotting, solid characters, and intriguing backdrop work splendidly in close- up, but their larger significance remains annoyingly unexplained, indeed barely even intimated. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Though it's an ancient art form, the aphorism is as spritely and as apposite as ever. Challenging and subversive, aphorisms deliver the short, sharp shocks of old forgotten truths. They are literature's hand luggage: they're light and compact, you can take them anywhere, and they contain everything you need to get through a rough day at the office or a dark night of the soul. But more than just a literary history, <i>The World in a Phrase</i> is a personal memoir of how aphorisms changed Geary's life&#x2015;and how, if not for an aphorism by W.H. Auden, he might never have met his wife. In our modern age of drive-through culture, pre-digested soundbites, and manufactured sentiment, <i>The World in a Phrase</i> explores how aphorisms still retain the power to instigate and inspire, enlighten and enrage, entertain and edify.</p></p><p><p><b>James Geary</b> is deputy editor of <i>Time </i>magazine Europe and the author of the popular science book <i>The Body Electric: An Anatomy of the New Bionic Senses</i>. He lives in London with his wife and three children.</p>It's not a stretch to say Geary is obsessed with aphorisms. Ever since discovering the literary form in the "Quotable Quotes" section of <i>Reader's Digest </i>when he was a child, he has been compiling them. Given his level of passion, it's fitting that he has penned what is probably the definitive work on aphorisms, a love letter&#x2013; cum&#x2013;memoir disguised as a reference book. It also explains why he occasionally gets so carried away that he describes Nietzsche as "the Evil [sic] Knievel of nineteenth-century philosophy" and Frenchman Joseph Joubert as "the great apostle of the aphorism." But Geary, deputy editor of the European edition of <i>Time </i>magazine, is also a veteran newsman, and for the most part he tones down the hype. He provides a useful definition&#x2014;an aphorism is brief, definitive, personal, philosophical and must have a twist&#x2014;along with lively thumbnail sketches of some of the masters of the form, among them Ludwig Wittgenstein and Mark Twain, "who deliberately set out to overturn [Benjamin] Franklin's friendly, avuncular sayings with his own darker, more ornery aphorisms." Geary's enthusiasm may overwhelm as much as it enlightens, but fellow fanatics will be delighted. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They return to the MaddAddamite cob house, which is being fortified against man and giant Pigoon alike. Accompanying them are the Crakers, the gentle, quasi-human species engineered by the brilliant but deceased Crake. While their reluctant prophet, Jimmy -- Crake's one-time friend -- recovers from a debilitating fever, it's left to Toby to narrate the Craker theology, with Crake as Creator. She must also deal with cultural misunderstandings, terrible coffee, and her jealousy over her lover, Zeb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Zeb searches for Adam One, founder of the God's Gardeners, the pacifist green religion from which Zeb broke years ago to lead the MaddAddamites in active resistance against the destructive CorpSeCorps. Now, under threat of an imminent Painballer attack, the MaddAddamites must fight back with the aid of their newfound allies, some of whom have four trotters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the centre, is the extraordinary story of Zeb's past, which involves a lost brother, a hidden murder, a bear, and a bizarre act of revenge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining adventure, humour, romance, superb storytelling, and an imagination that is at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, <i>MaddAddam</i> is vintage Margaret Atwood, and a moving and dramatic conclusion to her internationally celebrated dystopian trilogy.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2013:</strong> Margaret Atwood&#x2019;s genius is fed by her appetite for synthesis: she sees every consequential cultural and tech trend (the realized and the possible) and spins them out into a near-future that&#x2019;s both freakishly strange and horrifyingly plausible. MaddAddam concludes the trilogy she started with <i>Oryx and Crake</i> and <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, simultaneously set stories of the survivors (and the late creator) of a deliberately unleashed plague that&#x2019;s left a few ragged stragglers&#x2014;the fever-dreaming Snowman, remnants of a peaceful God&#x2019;s Gardeners cult and eco-warrior MaddAddamites, psychotic escapees from the Painball arena, and humanity&#x2019;s bioengineered &#x201c;replacements,&#x201d; the bizarrely placid Crakers&#x2014;all bushwhacking through a trashed world of animal mash-ups (including some wicked-smart Pigoons).

E. Lawrence&#x2014;the legendary British soldier, strategist, scholar, and adventurer whose exploits as &#x201c;Lawrence of Arabia&#x201d; created a legacy of mythic proportions in his own lifetime. Many know T.E. Lawrence from David Lean&#x2019;s Oscar-winning 1962 biopic&#x2014;based, itself, upon Lawrence&#x2019;s autobiographical <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>&#x2014;but in the tradition of modern biographers like John Meacham, David McCullough, and Barbara Leaming, Michael Korda&#x2019;s penetrating new examination reveals new depth and character in the twentieth century&#x2019;s quintessential English hero. <br></p><p><p>Michael Korda's <em>Hero</em> is the story of an epic life on a grand scale: a revealing, in-depth, and gripping biography of the extraordinary, mysterious, and dynamic Englishman whose daring exploits and romantic profile&#x2014;including his blond, sun-burnished good looks and flowing white robes&#x2014;made him an object of intense fascination, still famous the world over as "Lawrence of Arabia."</p><p>An Oxford scholar and archaeologist, one of five illegitimate sons of a British aristocrat who ran away with his daughters' governess, Lawrence was sent to Cairo as a young intelligence officer in 1916. He vanished into the desert in 1917 only to emerge later as one of the greatest&#x2014;and certainly most colorful&#x2014;figures of World War One. Though a foreigner, he played a leading and courageous part in uniting the Arab tribes to defeat the Turks, and eventually capture Damascus, transforming himself into a world-famous hero, hailed as "the Uncrowned King of Arabia." </p><p>In illuminating Lawrence's achievements, Korda digs further than anyone before him to expose the flesh-and-blood man and his contradictory nature. Here was a born leader who was utterly fearless and seemingly impervious to pain, thirst, fatigue, and danger, yet who remained shy, sensitive, mod-est, and retiring; a hero who turned down every honor and decoration offered to him, and was racked by moral guilt and doubt; a scholar and an aesthete who was also a bold and ruthless warrior; a writer of genius&#x2014;the author of <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, one of the greatest books ever written about war&#x2014;who was the virtual inventor of modern insurgency and guerrilla warfare; a man who at the same time sought and fled the limelight, and who found in friendships, with everyone from Winston Churchill to George Bernard and Charlotte Shaw, from Nancy Astor to No�l Coward, a substitute for sexual feelings that he rigorously&#x2014;even brutally and systematically&#x2014;repressed in himself.</p><p>As Korda shows in his brilliantly readable and formidably authoritative biography, Lawrence was not only a man of his times; he was a visionary whose accomplishments&#x2014;farsighted diplomat and kingmaker, military strategist of genius, perhaps the first modern "media celebrity" (and one of the first victims of it), and an acclaimed writer&#x2014;transcended his era.</p><p>Korda examines Lawrence's vision for the modern Middle East&#x2014;plans that, had they been carried through, might have prevented the hatred and bloodshed that have become ubiquitous in the region. Ultimately, as this magisterial work demonstrates, Lawrence remains one of the most unique and fascinating figures of modern times, the arch-hero whose life is at once a triumph and a sacrifice and whose capacity to astonish still remains undimmed.</p><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S.

"</p><p>&#34;Maynard Davies is one of the last apprentice-boy bacon curers, and he was trained in the dying arts of his trade in post-war Staffordshire. Becoming a master bacon curer, he went on to expand his repertoire by travelling to America where he taught the inmates of a large prison how to cure. With a young family, he then set up a small-holding in the Peak District and ran an (eventually) very successful farm, with home-spun smoking, curing and selling direct to the public. Maynard has four daughters and he and his wife Ann live in north Shropshire where he is still regarded as one of the country&#39;s leading experts in his field. In order to pass on his expertise as he retired, he has written up all his practical curing and smoking advice in his full-colour Manual of a Traditional Bacon Curer, published in September 2009.

Foster and the Tragedy of American Radicalism (Working Class in American History)</h2><p>In this trenchant work, James Barrett traces the political journey of a leading worker radical whose life and experiences encapsulate radicalism's rise and fall in the United States.<br><br> A self-educated wage earner raised in the slums of a large industrial city, William Z. Foster became a brilliant union organizer who helped build the American Federation of Labor and, later, radical Trade Union Educational League. Embracing socialism, syndicalism, and communism in turn, Foster rose through the ranks of the American Communist Party to stand at the forefront of labor politics throughout the 1920s. Yet by the time he died in 1961, in a Moscow hospital far from the meat-packing plants and steel mills where he had built his reputation, Foster's political marginalism stood as a symbol for the isolation of American labor radicalism in the postwar era.<br><br> Integrating both the indigenous and the international factors that determined the fate of American communism, <i>William Z. Foster and the Tragedy of American Radicalism</i> provides a new understanding of the basis for radicalism among twentieth-century American workers.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>James R. Barrett,</b> a professor of history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is the author of <i>Work and Community in the Jungle: Chicago's Packinghouse Workers, 1894-1922</i> and other books.<br> &nbsp;&#34;Drawn from private papers, FBI files, court records, Soviet archives, contemporary press accounts, congressional reports, etc., this gem of a biography is an illuminating and judicious study of a major figure in 20th-century American radicalism... [Barrett&#39;s] rich and complex portrait should be required reading for advanced students of modern American radicalism.&#34; -- Choice &#34;If historian Jim Barrett had never written anything before ... or ever again ... his reputation would be secure with this title alone. This is more than a biography, it is a look inside the radical left world through which Foster travelled including the Socialist Party, IWW, syndicalism, anarchism and the Communist Party... A must read for all those interested in radical history!&#34; - Emily Juares, The Socialist &#34; &#34;As much a study of American radicalism as it is of Foster himself.&#34; -- Michigan Historical Review &#34;The strength of Barrett&#39;s biography lies in his analysis of Foster&#39;s radicalism. Barrett captures Foster&#39;s commitment to industrial unionism, his gentle elitism, his passion for organizing the unorganized, his willingness to follow Soviet policy directives, and his crusading zeal undeterred by defeat.&#34; -- Ralph Scharnau, Journal of Illinois History &#34;A valuable contribution to the history of American communism, as well as labor history more broadly. Well researched and well written, it is likely to become the standard biography of the man who sought to become the American Stalin.&#34; -- John E. Moser, Pacific Northwest Quarterly &#34;James Barrett has provided a gripping account of America&#39;s most important radical of the first half of the twentieth century. ... Barrett&#39;s account of Foster provides a new synthesis in the approach to the history of American Communism, a synthesis that is not a bland compromise, but one that provides a methodology which provides historians with a valuable tool in their continued labours to understand America&#39;s radical past.&#34; -- Andy Strouthous, American Studies ADVANCE PRAISE &#34;An impressive accounting of the life of perhaps the leading figure in the American Communist Party. It is a broad and deep contextualization of Foster the individual, situating him in the general currents of working-class mobilization and political radicalism of his time.&#34; - Bryan Palmer, author of The Making of E. P. Thompson: Marxism, Humanism, and History &#34;Barrett&#39;s work stands in sharp contrast to any previous work on Foster. Instead of writing a history of a U.S. Communist leader, he has produced, through Foster&#39;s complex career and ideological developments, a history of the radical &#39;militant minority&#39; in its multiple forms ... during the first half of the twentieth century.&#34;-Fraser Ottanelli, author of The Communist Party of the United States: From the Depression to World War II</p><h2>Hail, Holy Queen</h2><p>A fresh and enlightening new perspective on Mary, Mother of God, and her central importance in the Christian faith, from the author of the highly successful <b>The Lamb's Supper</b><i>.<br></i><br>In <b>The Lamb's Supper</b>, Catholic scholar and apologist Scott Hahn explored the relationship between the Book of Revelation and the Roman Catholic Mass, deftly clarifying the most subtle of theological points with analogies and anecdotes from everyday life. In <b>Hail, Holy Queen</b>, he employs the same accessible, entertaining style to demonstrate Mary's essential role in Christianity's redemptive message.<br><br>Most Christians know that the life of Jesus is foreshadowed throughout the Old Testament. Through a close examination of the Bible, as well as the work of both Catholic and Protestant scholars and clergy, Hahn brings to light the small but significant details showing that just as Jesus is the "New Adam," so Mary is the "New Eve." He unveils the Marian mystery at the heart of the Book of Revelation and reveals how it is foretold in the very first pages of the Book of Genesis and in the story of King David's monarchy, which speaks of a privileged place for the mother of the king. <br><br>Building on these scriptural and historical foundations, Hahn presents a new look at the Marian doctrines: Her Immaculate Conception, Perpetual Virginity, Assumption, and Coronation. As he guides modern-day readers through passages filled with mysteries and poetry, Hahn helps them rediscover the ancient art and science of reading the Scriptures and gain a more profound understanding of their truthfulness and relevance to faith and the practice of religion in the contemporary world.</p><p><i>Hail, Holy Queen: The Mother of God in the Word of God</i> is theologian Scott Hahn's follow-up to his bestselling <i>The Lamb's Supper</i>. Like the previous book, <i>Hail, Holy Queen</i> melds autobiographical reflections, scriptural interpretation, and historical anecdotes in an accessible style to clarify some sophisticated points of Catholic theology. From the book's first sentence ("For all my newfound piety, I was still fifteen years old, and all too conscious of 'cool'"), the author's assured voice will capture the reader's interest. Readers outside Catholicism who are mystified by the centrality of Mary in Catholic devotion, and Catholics who wish to become more knowledgeable and reflective about a central aspect of their faith, will be especially drawn to <i>Hail, Holy Queen</i>. Among the book's most interesting claims is Hahn's contention that Marian devotion has shaped common ideas about motherhood. Hahn's teenage consciousness of cool made him ashamed of his mother. That kind of shame, he argues, helps to shape many Christians' ideas about Mary. And yet, citing John's Gospel, Hahn writes, "As He hung dying on the cross, in His last will and testament, Jesus left us a mother." <i>Hail, Holy Queen</i> charts a course from shame to respect and love. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Scott Hahn, an internationally renowned Catholic lecturer and apologist, is a professor of theology at the Franciscan University of Steubenville.

By the author of Dancing at the Rascal Fair. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Ivan Doig</b> grew up in a family of Montana ranch hands in the 1940s and 1950s. His books include <i>Mountain Time, Bucking the Sun,</i> and the highly acclaimed Montana Trilogy -- <i>English Creek, Dancing at the Rascal Fair,</i> and <i>Ride with Me, Mariah Montana.</i> He lives in Seattle with his wife, Carol.<p><b>Chapter One: Amended Star</b> </p><p><br> 1924 </p><p><br> <i>"The evening, the evening,<br> The evening brings all home."</i> </p><p><br> The last ringleted girl had finished off the ballad on a hopeful note -- she would have given her ears for a praising word from Miss Duff -- and night and quiet came again to the house on Highland Street. Regular as the curtain of nightfall was Susan Duff's routine in closing away her teaching day. Shoulders back, her tall frame straightening expectantly even though there was no one in the house to meet for the evening but herself, she shuffled sheet music into its rightful order, tallied the hours of lessons in the secondhand mercantile ledger she kept handy atop the piano, and cast an eye over the schedule of impending pupils, then the balky old doors of the music parlor were slid shut. Next a freshening of her face with a rinse of cold water; one adjusting glance into the mirror, never two; hairpins taken out, and her chestnut hair shaken down. Onward to her stovetop supper, which she raced through as though still making up for her father's interminable graces over expiring food. Now, with a pat to the kitchen and a cursory locking of doors and windows, she was ready to ascend. </p><p> As fixed as a star, the telltale glow of her gable window appeared over Helena at the last of dusk and burned on past respectable bedtime. You might think a woman of her early climb in life, singled out by her father's God for a soaring voice to lift His hymns and then casting away choirsong for the anthems of a harsh young century, would find it a hard comedown to be faced with a nightly audience of only herself. You'd be as wrong as you could be, Susan would have you know in a finger snap. </p><p> This night, however, no sooner was she upstairs than she whipped to a halt in front of the alcove of window, her gaze drawn down the hillside to the state capitol dome, resting as it did on the center of the government of Montana like a giant's copper helmet. The dome still was alight with the festoon of bulbs that had greeted 1924 three months ago, which seemed to her uncalled for. </p><p> "Blaze," Susan addressed the civic constellation in the coarse-ground Fife burr she was born to, "see if I care." </p><p> She gave a throaty chuckle at herself and wended her way toward her desk. Pausing to choose a lozenge from the cut-glass jar there, she tasted it thoughtfully with the tip of her tongue, then swirled it in her mouth as if it would clear away beginner lessons and quavery approximations of high C; poor Flossie, last pupil of the day and absolute farthest from a worthwhile voice. <i>No recital there,</i> she reflected, <i>except what I'll hear from her mother.</i> </p><p> Still caught in thought, Susan automatically cast a glance around to judge the state of her housekeeping up here and reached her usual conclusion that she needed the availability of these spacious hours beyond dark more than the place demanded housecleaning. The attic-like room extended the full length of the house -- loft quarters for a married pair of servants, this must have originally been -- and she treated the expanse like a rambler cottage perched above the formal quarters of downstairs. The rolltop desk, a divan, a Victrola, what had been her father's Morris chair and footstool, onyx-topped side tables, a blue-and-black knitted comforter on the sill seat of the strategically aimed gable window, swayback sets of bookshelves, a spinet piano, a typewriter sitting composedly on a rolling secretarial table, a highly unreliable new thing called a radio set standing on a sturdy side cabinet, the whopping Duff family Bible on a commemorative reading stand of its own, all populated what was in actual fact her bedroom. </p><p> This mob of comforts drew her up out of public day as if lifting her into a lifeboat, and Susan tallied the necessity of this each time, too. Liberal with the night, resourceful as she probably ever was going to be in what that Bible would have deemed her fortieth year under heaven, she held to the belief that she was most her reconstituted self in these upstairs hours, at this elevation where the minute hand did not count. The time of footlights and the song-led marches for the right of women to vote were tucked into the past as firmly as could be, and as to the tongues of the town down there beyond the base of the stairs, she could do nothing about those. But up here, what she could do was to get busy at life's amended version of Susan Duff. There were encouraging letters to be written to favorite former pupils. (Tonight's, which took lip-biting concentration, to the breathy young soprano whose recent <i>lieder</i> recital in Milwaukee had not found favor there; many a time Susan wished she could deal solely with the voices, shapes of sound standing free in the air, without the human wrappings.) This political city's newspapers to be devoured, Anaconda Copper's one for spite and the independent one for sustenance. Books in plenitude; currently she was trying to make her way through E. M. Forster and the murky doings in the Marabar Caves. Music, of course: her half-finished operetta <i>Prairie Tide</i> always awaited, always unnavigable; and the radio set sometimes brought in serenades from unimaginable distances and sometimes madly cackled out static; but the Victrola sang the songs of others perfectly on command, restorative in itself to a teacher of voice. Then too she still was secretary of the state chapter of the Over There Memorial Committee, which took her to a drafty meeting hall once a month and obliged her to see to official correspondence, clerical enough to cross the eyes, in between. Tonight, as always, she shifted workspots every so often, her tall solo figure suddenly on the move as if she were a living chess piece. Time did not lag here in her industrious garret; it was not permitted to. </p><p> When it was nearing midnight and she had just begun to salt away another day between diary covers, she faintly heard the turn of a key in the front door and then the rhythm of him coming up the stairs to her for the first time in four years. </p><p> ��� </p><p> "Susan? You might have changed the lock." </p><p> He arrived on the wings of that commanding smile. <i>The very model of a modern genteel major,</i> a line of hers teased somewhere back in that diary. The blue of his blood and the red silver of bayonet steel, those paradoxical flying colors by which he came through the war. Behind Wes, it was said, men would have charged Hell; in fact, men had. </p><p> Susan sat back hard in her chair at the desk, surprised no end to be confronted with him again after all this time. Even so she could not help but marvel at the presence with which Wes did most anything, as though the shadow under him were the thrust of a stage. Her emotions were more mixed about how little the years told on him. Poised there at the top of her stairs, wearing a fortune on his back -- or more aptly, on the swath of chest where General Pershing himself had pinned the highest medal -- as ever he looked ready to do a white-glove inspection. Civilian life, now that he was tailored to it again, was a continuation of duty by other means. Even his way of standing like that, the weight taken on his left leg to spare the right knee peppered by shrapnel at St. Mihiel, proclaimed the reliance that the world had wanted to place on him. Brave and wounded at the same time: the story of Wesley Williamson's life, as she was plentifully aware, on more than one kind of battlefield. </p><p> Voice training had unforeseen benefits. She thought she managed to sound in possession of herself -- or at least within her own custody -- as she spoke back to the immaculate invader: </p><p> "Evidently I saved you some shinnying, by not." </p><p> "Oh oh," Wes said, his smile dented but still there, "I guess I've been told." </p><p> He picked his way through the long room, interested as a museum-goer, to the perch nearest her, which happened to be the edge of her bed. "May I?" </p><p> <i>You and your Williamson manners.</i> In out of nowhere, walk uninvited into a woman's bedroom, then be solicitous about seating himself too near. Susan laughed to clear away her incredulity, and answered him in a tone that would have cut through bone: </p><p> "Sit yourself down, Wes, please do. I haven't had a good look at a family man in a while." </p><p> Wes ducked his head slightly in acknowledgment. <i>One thing about Susan, she doesn't just go through the motions of being riled.</i> At least she had not put the run on him, quite yet. He settled to the very outside of the bed, accommodating his leg, and wordlessly looked over at her before trying to make his case. The woman there just beyond reach had an enlarged sense of justice, which had been one of the first passions that drew them together. He saw that their years apart had deepened the lines of her, accented the lean longstroke features that would never amount to outright beauty, quite, but summed up as an august well-carved attractiveness; a face that had always had character enough for the capacity of a stage. The old disturbance Susan caused in him gathered at the base of his throat as he sat there reviewing her. That laugh of hers which started somewhere down in the Scotch gravel of her family footing, then her voice finding its way to the heaven-given lilt: Lord, how he missed that. The snip and snap of talk with her, all the times of concocting their political mustard plasters for the world. The linear extra helping of her, the long-boned grace that had added so to their lovemaking. Topping it all, her cinnamon eyes that could put you in your place and make you like it. Everything was there to be missed, as he contemplated Susan across the frozen distance between bed and desk. </p><p> "Lost, are you?" she inquired. "I thought this was still your New York time of year." </p><p> "You make me sound like a migratory bird." </p><p> "If you show the feather..." </p><p> "Didn't I hear you've been to France again yourself?" </p><p> "Committee doings. That was two years ago." </p><p> "Four take away two," he mused as if maintaining his own special calendar of their time apart. "Halfway back to when the earth cooled." </p><p> "Wes?" She put down her pen as if pinning something beneath it. "Do I get to know why you're here?" </p><p> "I'm working on that." Reluctantly giving up his inspection of her, he let his eyes slide over the motley keepsakes in attendance around her, the brass paperweight shaped like a treble clef, the tiny mock strongbox which held pen nibs, the soldier photograph with its tint going drab, the silver letter opener with the maiden of liberty, one breast bare and glinting, in bas relief on its handle. His gaze lit on the open pages in front of Susan. The voices of paper were one of his specialties. Thinking out loud, not a usual habit, he said: "A woman armed with a diary. Not the best company for me to be keeping, I suppose." </p><p> She looked at Wes across the small white field of pages. Just looked at him. When you have cost a man a governorship, what further scandal does he think you are apt to inflict on him? </p><p> The silence stretched. At last he brought out: </p><p> "You know I couldn't." </p><p> "I know you wouldn't," she said as if correcting his spelling. They had been through this and through this. A proven hero who could not or would not undergo a tug-of-war with his church. <i>"Wes, the Pope has no need of the divorce law. But you do."</i> Who had broken his vows six ways from Sunday in half the countries of Europe and in this very room and then would not break his misbegotten marriage. <i>"She's not a well woman, Susan. That on top of the faith -- I can't face leaving her when she's like this, it's against everything in me."</i> </p><p> Susan, from a family that had the stamina of sled dogs, held no patience for the delicate constitution and strategic indispositions of Wes's wife. She could not resist asking now: </p><p> "How is the tender Merrinell?" </p><p> For a start, his wife was under the impression Wes was in Minneapolis at this moment, buying grain consignments. He shifted a bit on the bed and reeled off that she was holding her own, at the Lake George place now for Easter break with the gold-dust twins, although they weren't especially twins anymore, only grudgingly even sisters....Susan half-listened, fascinated as of old with the change of atmosphere he brought into a room with him. In the period before him, one of her beaus at musical evenings, a tippler, smelled of cloves. She could swear Wes always carried the scent of silk. </p><p> He broke off what he was saying and again regarded Susan as though taking the opportunity to stock up on her. "We both know you don't care a hoot in hell about any of that. Let's try you. How is the Lord's gift to the musically inclined?" </p><p> "Oho, this from the man who always told me he couldn't tell Paganini from page nine? This isn't like you, Wes. At least your word was always good. When we stopped throwing ourselves at each other -- " </p><p> " -- when you dropped me like a bushel of hot peppers -- " </p><p> " -- when we were this close to being the flavor on every gossip's tongue and I said I'd have no more of it if I couldn't have you, we agreed that was that." </p><p> Actually, he recalled, she had handed him his walking papers with words more stinging than those: "If I'm going to be alone in life, Wes, it might as well be with myself." </p><p> "You're not doing either of us any good by barging in here in the middle of the night, are you," Susan was at now. "If I know anything about it, you were always quite concerned with 'appearances.'" </p><p> Wes waved that off. "No one much is up at this hour. I had Monty leave me off at the capitol grounds and came up around the back blocks. Here, come see the new Doozy." With the aimed quickness which had always reminded her of a catapult going off, he launched up on his good leg and was over to the gable. </p><p> In spite of herself, curiosity drew her over to the window by him. In the diffused glow of the strings of bulbs on the capitol dome, the butter-yellow Duesenberg could be seen parked down the hill from dozing Highland Street. Despite the night chill this time of year, Wes's bravely outfitted Negro chauffeur, Monty, was caressing the hood of the limousine with a polishing rag. The lanky form leaned into the already burnished surface as if magnetized to the machine. "Monty would sleep in it if I'd let him," Wes was saying. </p><p> Susan stood there transfixed. The Williamsons. Their wealth and their fortunes, which were two different things. She closed her eyes for an instant, overcome by the fresh weight of memory. Wes's coming here made her feel piqued, put upon, singled out a time too many, on down the list. There had been another man since him, not married but not worth marrying either. She didn't suppose Wes had shown any more belated wisdom and retrieved chastity than she had. They had gone their old separate anchorless ways. Yet here they were, side by side at a window again as if reviewing life's march bearing down on them. And when she opened her eyelids it was all still there: the penny-colored dome that should have been Wes's by civic right, her reflected outline on the pane of night beside his, the chauffeur stroking the flanks of the costly plaything. </p><p> Wes tur...</p></p><h2>Baking Artisan Pastries and Breads: Sweet and Savory Baking for Breakfast, Brunch, and Beyond</h2><p><p><i>Baking Artisan Breakfast Breads and Pastries</i> offers illustrated recipes that cater to all breakfast needs: from muffins ready within the hour to more decadent treats, such as lemon brioche doughnuts and chocolate croissants.

Actually, it's more of a chase. After the sudden death of their mother, young sisters Easter and Ruby are sent to a foster home. Their long-absent father Wade appears and takes them in the middle of the night. As Wade and his girls travel west, to a destination unknown even to Wade, the three are being tracked down by their legal guardian, an ex-cop named Brady, and an ex-con named Pruitt, who has sinister intentions for Wade. Like Cash's terrific debut <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em>, <em>Mercy</em> wrestles with themes of redemption. The perspectives alternate between Easter, Brady, and Pruitt, each with a unique view of Wade, whose own secrets slowly unravel throughout the course of Cash's dark and delicate novel.

Charles Colson and Nancy Pearcey show how the truth of Christianity can change the world. Internationally known author Charles Colson believes this to be the most significant book of his career. It carries a profound message needed by the church today and by individual Christians. The central theme is that faith in Jesus Christ is more than a private relationship with God; it&#39;s a way of seeing, understanding, and changing the world. Christian faith brings with it basic ideas and beliefs that are the answers and counters to the world&#39;s philosophies. Christians often feel a loss of confidence in the face of secular philosophy as expressed in the culture of our age. The claims of scientists, New Age beliefs, shifting morality and so on can confuse. The authors provide the tools to interpret and confront the false, bankrupt ideas of the world and to use the truth of Christianity to make a difference for good. They help their readers to evaluate their own lives and values. Colson and Pearcey offer the challenge -- How Now Shall We Live? This is a message for the church in the new millennium. Change in the world and in culture will not be achieved chiefly through political or social means, but by individual Christians knowing their faith and daring to be agents of God&#39;s grace.</p><p><i>How Now Shall We Live</i> was the heart cry of a people who lived during the Jewish exile from the Promised Land, yet it is no less the unspoken prayer of the faithful today. As author Chuck Colson puts it, "We live in a culture that is at best morally indifferent ... in which Judeo-Christian values are mocked ... in which violence, banality, meanness, and disintegrating personal behavior are destroying civility and endangering the very life of our communities." It is no small wonder that Colson--the founder of Prison Fellowship Ministries and author of several renowned Christian works--considers this book the most important work of his life.<p> America, Colson states, is now in a post-Judeo-Christian era. Technically, this is what "postmodernism" means. In a generation in which the most respected brands of thought about reality declare that "God is dead," it is clear that a faith-based worldview does not prevail. So how do we teach our children that belief in God is respectable and intelligent? How do we fulfill our mandate to make "disciples of all nations" when friends and coworkers find the Christian perspective foolhardy and--in terms of rational thought--almost insane? Most important, how do we renew our entire culture, especially as it infects the global community, with the "common grace" of reinstating a prevailing belief in God and in His moral order?</p><p> These questions' implications are far-reaching, and Colson's thorough inquiry is a ready match for the challenge. In effect, this book delivers a logical, more than just "because the Bible says so" framework for interpreting the Gospel to the postmodern world, while also illustrating the vision for a culture based entirely on Biblical principles--powerful tools, indeed.</p><p> Christians are taught to love God with all their hearts, all their strength, and all their <i>minds</i>. <i>How Now Shall We Live</i> emphasizes that <i>not</i> to use one's mind in this idea-saturated culture is to abandon dying neighbors to bleed by the side of the road while going about one's religious way. As Colson puts it, "turning our backs on the culture ... denies God's sovereignty over all of life." It's this compassionate severity and prodding intelligence that make this book not only a good read, but a life-changing one as well. <i>--Courtenay Gebhardt</i></p>Charles Colson is a popular speaker, radio commentator, former presidential aide to Richard Nixon, and founder of the international Prison Fellowship Ministries. He has also written several books, including "Born Again, Loving God, Kingdoms in Conflict, " and "The Body, " which have shaped Christian thinking. In 1993 Colson was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, given for extraordinary leadership and originality in advancing humanity's understanding of God. <p> Nancy R. Pearcey has served as the policy director of the Wilberforce Forum, the executive editor of "BreakPoint, " and the managing editor of "Origins and Designs." She is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute and the Francis A. Schaeffer Scholar at the World Journalism Institute.

One of its fundamental pillars is that its citizens live free from the fear of ordinary crime and criminals. <br><br>But in this society, millions do live in fear . . . of the State. Death is a whisper away. The mere suspicion of ideological disloyalty-owning a book from the decadent West, the wrong word at the wrong time-sends millions of innocents into the Gulags or to their executions. Defending the system from its citizens is the MGB, the State Security Force. And no MGB officer is more courageous, conscientious, or idealistic than Leo Demidov. <br><br>A war hero with a beautiful wife, Leo lives in relative luxury in Moscow, even providing a decent apartment for his parents. His only ambition has been to serve his country. For this greater good, he has arrested and interrogated. <br><br>Then the impossible happens. A different kind of criminal-a murderer-is on the loose, killing at will. At the same time, Leo finds himself demoted and denounced by his enemies, his world turned upside down, and every belief he's ever held shattered. The only way to save his life and the lives of his family is to uncover this criminal. But in a society that is officially paradise, it's a crime against the State to suggest that a murderer-much less a serial killer-is in their midst. Exiled from his home, with only his wife, Raisa, remaining at his side, Leo must confront the vast resources and reach of the MBG to find and stop a criminal that the State won't admit even exists.<br><br>Tom Rob Smith graduated from Cambridge in 2001 and lives in London. Child 44 is his first novel.</p><p>If all that Tom Rob Smith had done was to re-create Stalinist Russia, with all its double-speak hypocrisy, he would have written a worthwhile novel. He did so much more than that in <i>Child 44</i>, a frightening, chilling, almost unbelievable horror story about the very worst that Stalin's henchmen could manage. In this worker's paradise, superior in every way to the decadent West, the citizen's needs are met: health care, food, shelter, security. All one must offer in exchange are work and loyalty to the State. Leo Demidov is a believer, a former war hero who loves his country and wants only to serve it well. He puts contradictions out of his mind and carries on. Until something happens that he cannot ignore. A serial killer of children is on the loose, and the State cannot admit it. <p> To admit that such a murderer is committing these crimes is itself a crime against the State. Instead of coming to terms with it, the State's official position is that it is merely coincidental that children have been found dead, perhaps from accidents near the railroad tracks, perhaps from a person deemed insane, or, worse still, homosexual. But why does each victim have his or her stomach excised, a string around the ankle, and a mouth full of dirt? Coincidence? Leo, in disgrace and exiled to a country village, doesn't think so. How can he prove it when he is being pursued like a common criminal himself? He and his wife, Raisa, set out to find the killer. The revelations that follow are jaw-dropping and the suspense doesn't let up. This is a debut novel worth reading. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Tom Rob Smith is a 28-year-old screenwriter.

Despite the appealing character design that could easily draw the attention of a younger audience, much of the humor is directed toward older readers. Two examples of such instances are the Crocs' unending attempts to make a meal of Zebra, which includes starting an "assassin log" and the Rat's efforts to humiliate Pig, such as when Pig's talked into wearing a surgical mask so as not to spread the "stupid bug." Beyond this content, the comics in this collection vary in humor from witty social commentary, such as Pig's "Internet Happy Place" fashioned from a cardboard box, to the downright ridiculous, seen in the Fantastic Four trio, made up of Stapler Head, Doorstoppo, and Paper Jam Boy.

From 1955 to 1993 (the year of the show's final broadcast on PBS), Keeshan, in the role of Captain Kangaroo, entertained, educated, and shared his gentle brand of wisdom. This is a loving look at the full run of the show and its supporting cast. Separate chapters are devoted to Mr. Green Jeans (the versatile farmer), Gus Allegretti (the puppeteer for Bunny Rabbit and other characters), Ruth Manecke (the zoologist who introduced many animals to the show), guest stars (from Walter Cronkite to Minnie Pearl), the production staff, and Keeshan himself. Beautiful photos, thoughtful captions, and a genial text with a nice blend of facts and anecdotes make this an exceptional presentation. Without preaching or moralizing, Keeshan stresses his belief in creative, nonviolent, value-based educational entertainment for kids. Obviously, his approach was a winner?and so is his book.

It was "the perfect storm"--a tempest that may happen only once in a century--a nor'easter created by so rare a combination of factors that it could not possibly have been worse. Creating waves ten stories high and winds of 120 miles an hour, the storm whipped the sea to inconceivable levels few people on Earth have ever witnessed. Few, except the six-man crew of the <em>Andrea Gail</em>, a commercial fishing boat tragically headed towards its hellish center.</p></p><p>Meteorologists called the storm that hit North America's eastern seaboard in October 1991 a "perfect storm" because of the rare combination of factors that created it. For everyone else, it was perfect hell. In <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, author Sebastian Junger conjures for the reader the meteorological conditions that created the "storm of the century" and the impact the storm had on many of the people caught in it. Chief among these are the six crew members of the swordfish boat the <i>Andrea Gail</i>, all of whom were lost 500 miles from home beneath roiling seas and high waves. Working from published material, radio dialogues, eyewitness accounts, and the experiences of people who have survived similar events, Junger attempts to re-create the last moments of the <i>Andrea Gail</i> as well as the perilous high-seas rescues of other victims of the storm. <p> Like a Greek drama, <i>The Perfect Storm</i> builds slowly and inexorably to its tragic climax. The book weaves the history of the fishing industry and the science of predicting storms into the quotidian lives of those aboard the <i>Andrea Gail</i> and of others who would soon find themselves in the fury of the storm. Junger does a remarkable job of explaining a convergence of meteorological and human events in terms that make them both comprehensible and unforgettable.</p><i>The Perfect Storm</i> is a winner of the first Alex Awards honoring the best adult books for teenagers, given by the Young Adult Library Services Association and <i>Booklist</i>.</p><h2>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</h2><p>In his second collection of stories, as in his first, Carver&#39;s characters are peripheral people--people without education, insight or prospects, people too unimaginative to even give up. Carver celebrates these men and women.</p><p>"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love" is not only the most well-known short story title of the latter part of the 20th century; it has come to stand for an entire aesthetic, the bare-bones prose style for which Raymond Carver became famous. Perhaps, it could be argued, <i>too</i> famous, at least for his fiction's own good. Like those of Hemingway or any other writer similarly loved, imitated, parodied, and reviled, these stories can sometimes produce the sense of reading pastiche. "A man without hands came to the door to sell me a photograph of my house." "That morning she pours Teacher's over my belly and licks it off. That afternoon she tries to jump out the window." "My friend Mel McGinnis was talking. Mel is a cardiologist, and sometimes that gives him the right." What other writer ever produced first sentences like these? They are like doors into Carverworld, where everyone speaks in simple declarative phrases, no one ever stops at one beer, and failure or violence are the true outcomes of the American dream.<p> Yet these stories bear careful re-reading, like any truly important and enduring work. For one thing, Carver is one of the few writers who can make desperation--cutting your ex-wife's telephone cord in the middle of a conversation, standing on your own roof chunking rocks while a man with no hands takes your picture--deeply <i>funny</i>. Then there is the sheer craft that went into their creation. Despite their seeming simplicity, his tales are as artfully constructed as poems--and like poems, the best of them can make your breath catch in your throat. In the title piece, for instance, after the gin has been drunk, after the stories have been told, after the tensions in the room have come to the surface and subsided again, there comes a moment of strange lightness and peace: "I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark." </p><p> Much of what happens in <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</i> (1981) happens offstage, and we're left with tragedy's props: booze, instant coffee, furniture from a failed marriage, cigarettes smoked in the middle of the night. This is not merely a matter of technique. Carver leaves out a great deal, but that's only a measure of his characters' vulnerability, the nerve endings his stories lay bare.

Following a run on She-Hulk - which combined his sly humor and encyclopedic Marvel knowledge with an imaginative take on a comic-book law firm - Slott moved into the upper echelon of Marvel writers, launching Avengers: The Initiative and taking the reins on Mighty Avengers from Brian Michael Bendis. When Marvel gave Spider-Man a fresh start in 2008, Slott was one of several rotating writers on a thrice-monthly Amazing Spider-Man. Through three years and a hundred issues, Slott became the writer most closely identified with the web-slinger's "Brand New Day" era. Amazing hit the "Big Time" when Slott took over as full-time writer, chronicling a new chapter in the life of Peter Parker with artists such as Humberto Ramos, Stefano Caselli and Marcos Martin.<br><br>Mexican artist Humberto Ramos made his American comics debut in 1994 with DC's Impulse, featuring the Flash's brash grandson. In 1998, Ramos launched the creator-owned Crimson under Wildstorm's Cliffhanger imprint, illustrating the title for more than two years. He then moved to Marvel, becoming one of the most recognizable and innovative talents in comics. Seamlessly blending both Eastern and Western styles, the artist's artist has worked on many of Marvel's most iconic characters - including Spider-Man, Wolverine and the X-Men - in addition to a run on the fan-favorite Runaways.</p><h2>Cathedral, Forge, and Waterwheel: Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages</h2><p>In this account of Europe's rise to world leadership in technology, Frances and Joseph Gies make use of recent scholarship to destroy two time-honored myths. Myth One: that Europe's leap forward occurred suddenly in the "Renaissance," following centuries of medieval stagnation. Not so, say the Gieses: Early modern technology and experimental science were direct outgrowths of the decisive innovations of medieval Europe, in the tools and techniques of agriculture, craft industry, metallurgy, building construction, navigation, and war. Myth Two: that Europe achieved its primacy through "Western" superiority. On the contrary, the authors report, many of Europe's most important inventions - the horse harness, the stirrup, the magnetic compass, cotton and silk cultivation and manufacture, papermaking, firearms, "Arabic" numerals - had their origins outside Europe, in China, India, and Islam. The Gieses show how Europe synthesized its own innovations - the three-field system, water power in industry, the full-rigged ship, the putting-out system - into a powerful new combination of technology, economics, and politics.<br>From the expansion of medieval man's capabilities, the voyage of Columbus with all its fateful consequences is seen as an inevitable product, while even the genius of Leonardo da Vinci emerges from the context of earlier and lesser-known dreamers and tinkerers.<br>Cathedral, Forge, and Waterwheel is illustrated with more than 90 photographs and drawings. It is a Split Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club.</p><p>Historians, write Frances and Joseph Gies, have long tended to view the Middle Ages as a period of intellectual and scientific stagnation, a long era of backwardness, ignorance, and inertia. Many scholars of the Renaissance era, however, thought otherwise; the mathematician Jerome Cardan, for one, held that three medieval inventions--the magnetic compass, the printing press, and gunpowder--were of such significance that "the whole of antiquity has nothing equal to show."<p> In their lively history of medieval technology, the Gies team writes of such advances as the heavy plow, the Gothic flying buttress, linen undergarments, water pumps, and the lateen sail. During the medieval millennium, they suggest, a great technological and social revolution occurred "with the disappearance of mass slavery, the shift to water- and wind-power, the introduction of the open-field system of agriculture, and the importation, adaptation, or invention of an array of devices, from the wheelbarrow to double-entry bookkeeping." Many of those inventions or adaptations, brought into Europe from China and the Middle East, have scarcely been improved on today.</p><p> The medieval technological revolution, the authors conclude, came at a cost: much of Europe was deforested to make room for cropland and to fire kilns and furnaces, and mechanization made obsolete many handicraft skills. Yet, they add, the workers and inventors of the Middle Ages "all transformed the world, on balance very much to the world's advantage." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>Frances (1915&#x2013;2013) and Joseph (1916&#x2013;2006) Gies were the world&#x2019;s bestselling historians of medieval Europe. Together and separately, they wrote more than twenty books, which col-lectively have sold more than a million copies. They lived in Michigan.</p><p></p></p><h2>Gone Gull: A Meg Langslow Mystery (Meg Langslow Mysteries, 21)</h2><p><p><b>Andrews soars into summer with a crafty new Meg Langslow mystery.</b><br><i></i><br><i>Gone Gull </i>brings readers yet another knee-slapping adventure filled with <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Donna Andrews&#x2019; cast of wacky characters.</p><p>Meg is spending the summer at the Biscuit Mountain Craft Center, helping her grandmother Cordelia run the studios.

It suddenly seemed completely ridiculous that&nbsp;girls were not allowed to wear pants to school&#x2014;even in winter,&nbsp;when we had to navigate snowdrifts in dresses and rubber boots.&nbsp;We weren&#x2019;t allowed to wear panty hose either. What was this nonsense?&nbsp;I asked the principal, Mr. Toole.<br><br>Mr. Toole, with his big, square, black-rimmed glasses that&nbsp;looked like twin TV sets, said, &#x201c;Janice, if you can get the majority&nbsp;of the girls in your class to sign a petition, I will allow you and&nbsp;them to wear pants.&#x201d; He said this to me then smiled. I thought, <i>This</i>&nbsp;<i>is too easy. You are a </i>fool, <i>Mr. Toole! This thing will be knocked</i>&nbsp;<i>out by the end of week</i>. I was in fifth grade.<br><br> That night, with the help of my dad, I created a petition. It&nbsp;simply said, &#x201c;We, the undersigned, wish to be granted the right to&nbsp;wear pants to school.&#x201d; I thought there couldn&#x2019;t be a simpler thing. All the girls wanted to wear pants. All the girls complained about&nbsp;having to wear dresses. All I had to do to change that was round&nbsp;up a posse and have them sign their names.<br>I was about to get my first lesson in reality.&nbsp;<br><br>Mr. Toole had the benefit of wisdom and cynicism on his side.&nbsp;He watched with a bemused grin as I was rejected, one after&nbsp;another, by every girl in my class. I was at once outraged, perplexed,&nbsp;and crushed that no one would support what I thought&nbsp;was a group cause.<br><br>&#x201c;But don&#x2019;t you want to wear pants to school?&#x201d; I pleaded with&nbsp;Joan White.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I do,&#x201d; she answered, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll get in trouble if I sign&nbsp;that thing.&#x201d; Girls weren&#x2019;t supposed to assert themselves back then&nbsp;or get involved in any sort of &#x201c;controversy,&#x201d; which apparently my&nbsp;pants petition was. Some girls wouldn&#x2019;t speak to me at all that&nbsp;day. I went home defeated.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give up,&#x201d; Dad told me. &#x201c;Go back and try a different&nbsp;approach.&#x201d; I thought about what had <br>worked with Rocky. The&nbsp;next day I approached the girls in my class.<br><br>&#x201c;Sign this,&#x201d; I told them, brandishing the pen like a whip, &#x201c;or&nbsp;you don&#x2019;t want to even <i>think </i>about what will happen.&#x201d;&nbsp;The whip proved once again victorious, and with the majority&nbsp;of the girls&#x2019; names on my petition, I knocked on Mr. Toole&#x2019;s door.<br><br>&#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; I told him when he ushered me inside. &#x201c;We will start&nbsp;wearing pants tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Janice,&#x201d; he said, tossing the petition into the garbage without&nbsp;giving it a glance, &#x201c;you can <br>come to school in a bathing suit,&nbsp;you can come to school naked, but you will never, <i>ever </i>come to&nbsp;school in pants.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But what about . . . ?&#x201d; I pleaded, pointing at the wastebasket.<br><br>&#x201c;I repeat,&#x201d; he said, bringing his big, fat face close to mine. He&nbsp;paused for effect and I watched my reflection in his glasses, my face&nbsp;turning a furious red. &#x201c;You will <i>never </i>come to school in pants.&#x201d;<br><br>I staggered out of his office and stood in the hallway. What&nbsp;just happened? I&#x2019;d followed the rules, but it was all a trick. The&nbsp;injustice! There was no going back to class now, only to admit to&nbsp;failure. Were adults really so treacherous and full of deceit? Was I&nbsp;completely naive? I&#x2019;d done everything I was supposed to do, and&nbsp;therefore, the fair thing was that I should have won this <br>round.<br><br>It was only because I was a child and powerless that I was about&nbsp;to be humiliated and shamed into submission.&nbsp;The next day, careful not to reveal my plan to my mother, I&nbsp;wore a bathing suit under my dress, and when I arrived at school I&nbsp;disrobed. The principal was summoned to our class and, gasping,&nbsp;ordered me to &#x201c;put some clothes on, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; My mother<br> was called to Mr. Toole&#x2019;s office on &#x201c;an emergency basis,&#x201d; and after he related my &#x201c;insubordination,&#x201d; I was placed on suspension. In&nbsp;his office, in front of my mother, I confronted him.<br><br>&#x201c;But you told me I could come to school in a bathing suit or naked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I said no such thing,&#x201d; he bellowed.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Toole,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re lying.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a while before I saw the inside of my classroom again.&nbsp;Two years later Mr. Toole was transferred, and girls were finally&nbsp;allowed to wear pants.</p><h2>Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches (Penguin Vitae)</h2><p><b>Presenting the essential writings of black lesbian poet and feminist writer Audre Lorde, <i>Sister Outsider</i> celebrates an influential voice in twentieth-century literature, with a foreword by Mahogany L.

We are so eager to do everything digitally&#x2015;hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners&#x2015;that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology.

She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding &#x201c;the cyborg future is not coming any time soon&#x201d;; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can't pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the <i>Titanic</i> disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software.

In the changing locations and architecture of our ballparks, Goldberger reveals the manifestations of a changing society: the earliest ballparks evoked the Victorian age in their accommodations--bleachers for the riffraff, grandstands for the middle-class; the "concrete donuts" of the 1950s and '60s made plain television's grip on the public's attention; and more recent ballparks, like Baltimore's Camden Yards, signal a new way forward for stadium design and for baseball's role in urban development. Throughout, Goldberger shows us the way in which baseball's history is concurrent with our cultural history: the rise of urban parks and public transportation; the development of new building materials and engineering and design skills. And how the site details and the requirements of the game--the diamond, the outfields, the walls, the grandstands--shaped our most beloved ballparks. <br><br>A fascinating, exuberant ode to the Edens at the heart of our cities--where dreams are as limitless as the outfields.</p><p>PAUL GOLDBERGER, a contributing editor at <i>Vanity Fair,</i> began his career at <i>The New York Times,</i> where he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism for his writing on architecture. Later, and for fifteen years, he was architecture critic for <i>The New Yorker.</i> He is the author of many books, most recently <i>Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry</i> and <i>Why Architecture Matters</i>. He teaches at the New School and lectures widely around the country on architecture, design, historic preservation, and cities. He and his wife live in New York City.<b>1</b><br><br> <b>Brooklyn Beginnings</b><br><br> The first baseball games were played in open fields, but the first baseball park&#x2014;the first place constructed specifically for the game, with places for paying spectators and surrounded by walls to keep non-payers out&#x2014;was constructed in Brooklyn, New York, by a politically well-connected entrepreneur named William Cammeyer, who built it on land he owned, called Union Grounds, on Rutledge Street in the south�ern portion of Williamsburg. The year was 1862, a year after the start of the Civil War and more than half a century before another politically well-connected entrepreneur, Charles Ebbets, would open a far more famous baseball park in Brooklyn. Ebbets Field would last for forty-seven years and become the stuff of legend; Union Grounds survived for barely more than two decades, but its short life belied its influence: from Cam�meyer&#x2019;s enclosure the baseball park was born. Union Grounds marked the beginning of the idea that baseball, the game of infinite space, should be played in an urban structure of very finite space, fitted and sometimes contorted into the urban grid. Union Grounds, constructed on a site bor�dered by Marcy and Harrison Avenues and Rutland and Lynch Streets, was a green field of play, a thing apart from the city and at the same time intimately connected to it. <br><br> Cammeyer, whose resources came from a family-owned leather company, did not build his baseball park out of a love of the sport. He was a businessman, and known to travel in the social circle of William Magear Tweed, the notorious boss of Tammany Hall. Like Tweed he endeavored to present a respectable face to the world even as he was trying as hard as he could to fill his pockets. Cammeyer preferred to use Union Grounds for the more genteel activities of horseback riding in the summer and ice skating in the winter&#x2014;the problem was that those activities weren&#x2019;t making him enough money, and he could not afford to maintain Union Grounds as a losing investment. Williamsburg, a prosperous and tranquil enclave early in the nineteenth century, was, like many parts of Brooklyn and New York, already giving way to the dense, gritty city of the indus�trial age, and its population was increasingly made up of immigrants whose notions of summer recreation did not include horses. Cammeyer saw that baseball, which in the middle of the nineteenth century was a game played mainly by a collection of clubs that operated more like fraternal associations than professional teams, was becoming increasingly popular as a source of working-class entertainment, and was beginning to be an economic entity as well as a recreational one. It was moving toward professionalism in awkward fits and starts that included, among other things, players paid under the table and, in the case of a team that Tweed sponsored, players who were given no-show jobs on the city pay�roll. When the Fashion Race Course, a racetrack on Long Island, spon�sored an all-star game in 1858 pitting players from various Brooklyn teams against their counterparts from New York, then a separate city, the track owners charged an admission fee of ten cents, probably the first time people were required to pay for the privilege of watching other people play baseball. There was potential in this, Cammeyer realized, especially if the game could be played in a place designed specifically for it rather than on a racetrack taken over for the occasion. Instead of charging the teams rent for the use of his field, he would charge the spectators.<br><br> Cammeyer caught the wave of baseball&#x2019;s steady progress toward pro�fessionalism, and pushed it forward. In the years before the Civil War, the game, which had been played in various forms in the United States for several generations, was codified into something roughly like modern baseball, as differing sets of rules gave way to relatively consistent prac�tices. For all that some historians of the game would embrace a mythol�ogy of its rural origins, baseball&#x2019;s ultimate form would be established more on the streets of New York than in the meadows of New England. It was in the metropolitan sprawl of New York and neighboring Brooklyn that the greatest number of teams was located&#x2014;according to historians Mike Wallace and Edwin G. Burrows, there were nearly one hundred of them by 1858&#x2014;and it was through their mutual negotiations that the rules were established. The sport was largely self-governing. In the spring of 1854 the New York Knickerbockers, one of the earliest and most estab�lished teams&#x2014;it was set up with a constitution, bylaws, and a set of playing rules in 1845&#x2014;convened a meeting at Smith&#x2019;s Hotel on Howard Street with the two other best-known teams in the city, the Gothams and the Eagles, to try and sort out inconsistencies in the manner of play, most particularly the standard distance between the bases. The meeting at Smith&#x2019;s set the distance between the bases as &#x201c;forty-two paces,&#x201d; and from home to the pitcher as &#x201c;not less than fifteen paces,&#x201d; according to John Thorn, the baseball historian. The first team to score twenty-one &#x201c;aces&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>runs </i>in today&#x2019;s parlance&#x2014;was the winner.<br><br> Three years later, the Knickerbockers organized another gathering at Smith&#x2019;s, which by then had moved to new quarters on Broome Street. At this second meeting the teams agreed to dispense with the rule of twenty-one aces and instead limit games to nine innings, with each team having three outs per inning. More relevant to the form of the ballpark, the teams agreed to establish the idea of foul territory, demarcating a line that extended from first base toward right field and third base toward left field to determine precisely where a batted ball had to go to remain in play.<br><br> New York had players, it had a clear set of rules, and it had fans. (It also had the major national sports journals, which by giving extensive coverage to the city&#x2019;s baseball teams further institutionalized New York&#x2019;s version of baseball&#x2019;s rules as the standard.) What New York lacked was wide-open playing fields, since the years of baseball&#x2019;s development coin�cided with the city&#x2019;s own explosive growth, as blocks of tenements and brownstones and factories, not to mention railroad tracks, spread out over the grid of streets. They made most of New York a city in which the man-made all but squeezed out any presence of nature. It was not just Williamsburg that was changing; New Yorkers from all neighborhoods who wanted to play baseball had trouble finding flat, open space large enough to accommodate the game. Early games were often played in Madison Square, but games were technically illegal in city-owned open space, and while that law may have been enforced only sporadically, the pressures of urbanization, including the presence of nearby streetcars, brought an end to active baseball play at Madison Square by the mid-1840s. The favored locale of many of the region&#x2019;s baseball teams, includ�ing Alexander Cartwright&#x2019;s Knickerbockers, shifted to the other side of the Hudson River to one of the area&#x2019;s most popular pleasure grounds, the Elysian Fields in Hoboken. Its owner, John Cox Stevens, began hosting organized baseball games in the 1840s, attracting New Yorkers not only with the allure of his pastoral setting but with the claim that Hoboken was free of the yellow fever that afflicted New York.<br><br> Stevens&#x2019;s site was definitely free of the encroachments of the indus�trializing city. And, as A. Bartlett Giamatti would observe many years later, the very name Elysian Fields evoked classical aspirations to paradise, a metaphor that Giamatti would use frequently to describe baseball. Hoboken would have a decent run as the baseball capital. But it would not remain pastoral for long. Stevens, scion of an aristocratic family with a riverfront estate in Hoboken and a mansion in Manhattan, owned the ferries that transported visitors across the Hudson, and he wanted a larger crowd than baseball could provide. He positioned the Elysian Fields as an amusement park offering people of every stripe an escape from the pressures of the hectic city, and he gave them a merry-go-round, a race�track, a bowling alley, and events staged by P. T. Barnum. Bars and hotels were built near the ball grounds, and Stevens was so convinced that he was providing New York with a necessary public amenity that he asked the city for a subsidy, even though Hoboken was outside the borders of New York City and, indeed, of New York State. With Stevens&#x2019;s success at turning Elysian Fields into a proto&#x2013;Coney Island, whatever wholesome appeal Hoboken&#x2019;s natural setting might have had soon evaporated. It was a place that attracted the less respectable crowds, not to mention respect�able folk hoping to pursue less respectable activities. George Temple�ton Strong, the lawyer and diarist, visited Hoboken from his home in Gramercy Park and reported, &#x201c;I saw scarce anyone there but snobs and their strumpets.&#x201d; It was, Strong observed in his diary, a &#x201c;pity it&#x2019;s haunted by such a gang as frequent it.&#x201d;<br><br> Baseball was hardly the sport of the elite, but neither did the play�ers nor their growing base of fans want to see the game played in the shadow of a raffish amusement park. With more and more teams in Brooklyn, Cammeyer saw that he could provide at Union Grounds a field both closer to home and free of competition from other forms of amusement. Brooklyn by the end of the 1850s had so many teams that &#x201c;games [were] being played on every available plot within a ten-mile radius of the city,&#x201d; according to <i>Porter&#x2019;s Spirit of the Times, </i>which called Brooklyn &#x201c;the city of base ball clubs.&#x201d; Many of the clubs were intimately connected to neighborhoods, sometimes even taking their names from local streets like Putnam Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, or local businesses like the Eckford and Webb shipyard. Brooklyn&#x2019;s rapidly growing, heav�ily immigrant population&#x2014;the borough had gone from a population of twenty-five thousand in 1835 to two hundred thousand in 1855, nearly half of whom were immigrants&#x2014;sorted itself naturally into localized fan groups for each team. &#x201c;More than any other American game, baseball was built on a geographical and psychological sense of localism&#x2014;if we take localism to be simultaneously an attachment to one place and fear, antipathy or competitiveness toward other places,&#x201d; Warren Goldstein has written. And Cammeyer realized that however bitter their neighborhood rivalries might be, the loyalists who rooted for the various clubs had one thing in common besides Brooklyn addresses: they could all become his customers.<br><br> The six-and-a-half-foot-high wooden fence that Cammeyer erected around Union Grounds was intended to keep non-paying customers out, not to create a dividing line between fly balls that could be caught and those that were out of play, the critical role that ballpark fences would come to play soon thereafter. Cammeyer saw his fence&#x2014;which was more than five hundred feet away from home plate at the far point of center field, a distance no batted ball could reach&#x2014;as a matter of capitalism, not ground rules. His motivations for presenting baseball inside a fenced enclosure were to attract a large crowd, make money, and yet retain some degree of decorum. The Union Grounds had a covered viewing section set aside for women and their gentlemen companions, a further state�ment of gentility intended to encourage the attendance of women, whose presence was thought to dampen the raucousness of men. &#x201c;Wherever [the ladies&#x2019;] presence enlivens the scene, there gentlemanly conduct will follow. Indecorous proceedings will cause the offenders to be instantly expelled from the grounds,&#x201d; reported the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>, in praise of Cammeyer&#x2019;s decision to market the Union Grounds as a place of modesty and good manners, &#x201c;where ladies can witness the game without being annoyed by the indecorous behavior of the rowdies who attend some of the first-class matches.&#x201d; <br><br> Cammeyer knew better than to make the entire place into a demon�stration of Victorian gentility. He saw, as Warren Goldstein wrote, that &#x201c;the game appealed simultaneously to the culture of urban streets . . . and to the respectable and newly vigorous culture of middle class Victorian men.&#x201d; And so there was another viewing section, distinctly separate from the one for ladies and couples, that was set aside for gambling. There, men could smoke, drink, and make bets on the game. Cammeyer had given them the equivalent of a saloon in the open air. He was prescient enough to realize that to market baseball to a broad audience he needed some degree of propriety, but not too much. He sought to position the Union Grounds as a place of mass entertainment, more respectable than the honky-tonk of Hoboken and yet lively enough to assure that no one would mistake it for a church. Not only was gambling encouraged, Cam�meyer had a band playing throughout the ball game, keeping the crowds entertained.<br><br> When Cammeyer drained the skating pond and filled it in to create the playing field, he left intact a small, peaked-roof structure, something like a pagoda, that had stood at the far end of the pond. It was in what became the outfield, somewhat to the right of center field, about 350 feet from home plate, very much within the field of play. The outfield pagoda gave the Union Grounds the beginning of an architectural identity, and its very quirkiness, and the way in which its intrusive form made play�ing baseball on Cammeyer&#x2019;s field different from playing anywhere else, established another pattern for early baseball parks: they were designed, as often as not, around obstacles, which made for certain eccentricities. There was no expectation that any field would look like any other, and if that meant that play was slightly different from one ballpark to another, that was all considered part of the nature of the game.</p><h2>Basho: The Complete Haiku</h2><p><i>Basho</i> stands today as Japan&#x2019;s most renowned writer, and one of the most revered. Wherever Japanese literature, poetry or Zen are studied, his oeuvre carries weight. Every new student of haiku quickly learns that <i>Basho</i> was the greatest of the Old Japanese Masters.<br>Yet despite his stature, <i>Basho</i>&#x2019;s complete haiku have not been collected into a single volume. Until now.<br>To render the writer&#x2019;s full body of work into English, Jane Reichhold, an American haiku poet and translator, dedicated over ten years of work. In <i>Basho</i>: The Complete Haiku, she accomplishes the feat with distinction. Dividing his creative output into seven periods of development, Reichhold frames each period with a decisive biographical sketch of the poet&#x2019;s travels, creative influences and personal triumphs and defeats. Scrupulously annotated notes accompany each poem; and a glossary and two indexes fill out the volume.<br>Reichhold notes that, "<i>Basho</i> was a genius with words." He obsessively sought out the right word for each phrase of the succinct seventeen-syllable haiku, seeking the very essence of experience and expression. With equal dedication, Reichhold sought the ideal translations. As a result, <i>Basho</i>: The Complete Haiku is likely to become the essential work on this brilliant poet and will stand as the most authoritative book on the subject for many years to come. Original sumi-e ink drawings by artist Shiro Tsujimura complement the haiku throughout the book.</p><p><b>JANE REICHHOLD</b> is one of the top poets in the American haiku world. She has written over twenty books, most of them on haiku or poetry, including Writing and Enjoying Haiku: A Hands-on Guide. Three of her books have received awards from the Haiku Society of America, and she has twice won the Literature Award from the Museum of Haiku in Tokyo.<br><b>SHIRO TSUJIMURA</b> is a renowned Japanese artist and potter with works in museums around the world. His striking work appears on the cover and throughout the Kodansha International edition of Basho&#x2019;s classic, A Haiku Journey.</p><h2>Grounded Spirituality</h2><p><p>In this courageous, groundbreaking book, author Jeff Brown takes us on the spiritual ride of a lifetime. The book opens with the author's compelling journey through a variety of spiritual approaches. Through decades of dedicated exploration and discernment, Brown exposes the transcendent notions of spirituality that limit our human experience. In his fiercely authentic, no-holds-barred style, Brown reveals that what we view as 'spiritual' is often devoid of the gift that makes us most alive--our precious and unique selfhood. He demonstrates that true spirituality is a whole-being awakening, one that heartfully embraces our entire human experience: our feelings, our stories, our bodies, our relationships with others, and the earth that houses us. <br> <br>Brown then engages in a riveting dialogue with a fictitious spiritual seeker named Michael. Their conversations unfurl in warmth and humor, threaded with cutting truth and inspiring realization. Hands-on exercises throughout provide a direct experience of a vital new model.</p> <p>In Grounded Spirituality, the author lays down the tracks for an embodied way of being--one that leaves us 'enrealed,' integrated, and purposeful. Not awakened--but awakening. Not transcending our humanness--but finding meaning and spirituality within it, right in the heart of our imperfect daily lives. At long last, we can lay down our weary heads, burdened by the impossibility of transcending our human experience. Back to our roots, back into our bodies, back into all that makes us magnificently human. Home at last...</p></p><p>A former criminal lawyer and psychotherapist, Jeff Brown is the author of 5 popular books: <i>Soulshaping: A Journey of Self-Creation</i>,&nbsp;<i>Ascending with Both Feet on the Ground</i>, <i>Love It Forward</i>, <i>An Uncommon Bond</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Spiritual Graffiti</i>. He is also the producer and primary journeyer in the award-winning spiritual documentary, <i>Karmageddon</i>, which also stars Ram Dass, Seane Corn, David Life, Deva Premal and Miten.<br><br>After writing a series of inspirations for ABC'S 'Good Morning America' in 2010, and appearing on Fox News.com and dozens of radio shows, Brown wrote the viral blog 'Apologies to the Divine Feminine (from a warrior in transition)' that autumn, catapulting him to a greater degree of notoriety, particularly in social media. Jeff's new terms and short writings became a phenomenon some years ago, and continue to be shared by seekers and growers worldwide. His quotes have been shared in social media by Alanis Morrissette, Fergie, Chrissy Metz, and many other well-known figures. Most beautifully, they have touched and benefited millions of souls. This gratifies him deeply. He now understands that most of the challenges he faced, and the millions of steps of overcoming, were intended for this purpose: To support humanity in their efforts to embody all that they are. Not to bypass their humanness, but to celebrate it. Not to find enlightenment independent of the self, but to find their awakening deep within it. <br>&nbsp;<br>In April, 2018, Jeff was invited to Ottawa by Sophie Gr�goire Trudeau--gender equality activist and the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau--to film a conversation about emotional healing and inclusivity. Excerpts from that dialogue are viewable on Sophie's Facebook and Instagram pages. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jeff is also the founder of Soulshaping Institute and Enrealment Press. He lives in Canada with his wife, poet Susan Frybort.<p>'Jeff Brown is an iconoclastic visionary about intimate matters. There aren't many of those around, since most modern geniuses seem devoted to seemingly more glamorous and critical matters like artificial intelligence, 3-D printers, and smart chips implanted in our brains. But the truth is--at least in my view--revolutionizing the way we do our inner work and craft our intimate relationships is the most important action we can take to transform the world. And Jeff provides potent ideas to help us do just that. His rigorous imagination is in service to creating a more emotionally intelligent culture.When I read his words, I get riled up in all the best ways. He disrupts my habitual thought grooves, which inevitably leads to unexpected healings and inspirations. These days the word 'soul' gets carelessly bandied around by many lazy and sloppy thinkers, but Jeff is not one of them. He is reverent and impeccable, an astute connoisseur of the soul and its needs.' --ROB BREZSNY, author of the weekly column Free Will Astrology and the book Pronoia Is the Antidote for Paranoia;</p> <p>'Jeff Brown never disappoints, and his latest book, Grounded Spirituality, is no exception. Jeff is a uniquely human sage-preacher-man for the most cutting-edge,revolutionary, evolutionary take on human spirituality. There is nothing more needed in this broken world than the re-emergence of a human culture that deeply honors that which is real--the worthy dirt of this earth, the smile from a stranger, the tears we all shed at the moment of a loved one's death, our flesh and bones... these are the sacred meditation objects of Jeff Brown's Grounded Spirituality. In this book, Jeff offers his vulnerable and ever-so-human heart, through his own personal story of spiritual struggle and revelation. He also takes on the role of a wisened sage, reminiscent of an ancient Vedic teacher-student conversation style. Most impressively, this book places its finger on the exact pulse of cutting-edge spiritual development--a place that honors tradition, while at the same time, dramatically breaking from its harmful patriarchal shackles. While reading this book, I could feel the Goddess smiling.' --KATIE SILCOX, New York Times Best-Selling author of Healthy, Happy, Sexy--Ayurveda Wisdom for Modern Women;</p> <p>'Anyone who has felt the least confusion on their spiritual path should immediately get a copy of Grounded Spirituality and start reading. With laser precision, Jeff Brown dissects what passes for wisdom in much of today's spiritual teachings, slices away the illusions, and lays bare the simple truth: to grow into your spirituality is to grow into your humanity, in all its connected, tender, messy, luminous embodiment. And simple as that truth is, Brown doesn't pretend that the path to a fully embodied humanity is a piece of cake. He renders the pitfalls and rewards of that journey poignantly clear in a fictionalized dialogue that carries the reader towards a personal renewal of their own sacred purpose. The clear-eyed passion that fueled this book helps bring us closer to the future we all need.' --PHILIP SHEPHERD, author of Radical Wholeness and New Self, New World;</p> <p>'This is a crucial book that needs to be thoroughly read, explored and discussed. Jeff Brown eagerly invites us to look into the utmost importance of a grounded spirituality. At a time when much of spirituality has diverted us away from our true individual self, our authenticity, and our sense of social and ecological solidarity, this book orients us back to a spirituality rooted in our humanity and in our participation in the struggle of the world for greater freedom and justice. This book is a much needed masterpiece!' --CHRIS SAADE, author of Second Wave Spirituality, and co-author of Evolutionary Love Relationships;</p> <p>'With absolutely naked transparency, Jeff Brown, in Grounded Spirituality shares his complicated spiritual journey--the good, the bad, the ugly, and everything in between. He recounts the twists and turns of his path without any narcissistic indulgence, but with an outpouring of broken-open vulnerability and courage. Jeff shows us that we are already divine, and our work is not necessarily to become 'more spiritual,' but to immerse ourselves in the life-altering process of becoming wholly human, wholly here, wholly present to our embodied existence on this planet.' --CAROLYN BAKER, author of Dark Gold: The Human Shadow and The Global Crisis, and co-author with Andrew Harvey of Return to Joy,and Savage Grace: Living Resiliently In The Dark Night of The Globe;</p> <p>'Jeff Brown's wisdom in Grounded Spirituality--the idea that 'life is the only real spiritual teacher' --resonates deeply with my own lived experience and with what I have witnessed with my clients and students. He articulates so well how our truest path includes our stories, our emotions, and especially our bodies... that our bodies not only house our souls--they are inseparable from them while we walk this earth. The exercises woven with the story will support any seeker to become a 'finder.' I believe Alexander Lowen and John Pierrakos would proudly recommend Grounded Spirituality if they were still embodied. I know I will recommend it to my students.' --KATE HOLT, RN, Core Energetics Practitioner and Teacher. Executive Director, Institute of Core Energetics;</p> <p>'There are certain themes that wash through the works of Jeff Brown. They touch the reader with different colors and textures, but the intention remains the same. His message is grounded in human vulnerability with the desire, the longing, for a connection to the wonder of the Divine whilst remaining utterly true to our human nature. He is a breath of fresh air in these times of rapid and uncompromising change. This book is like a warm hand that reaches for yours with the promise of safe passage.' --ANAIYA SOPHIA, author of Sacred Sexual Union, and Fierce,Fierce Feminine: One Woman's Journey to Find Her Authentic Voice;</p> <p>'Jeff Brown, who has long been known for his bold,passionate, and grounded approach to life and spirituality, has written an epic saga about truth, freedom, spirit, and what it means to be divinely human. He blends wisdom, humor, and illuminating moments of autobiography into a lively conversation that takes people out of their heads and returns them to their bodies--where our messy human emotions live. This is a book that vibrates with life, sensuality, and a willingness to embrace our humanity without apology. Jeff's compassion for the human condition may well be the antidote for the kind of apathy that has torn people away from their tenderness and ability to care for themselves, one another, and our planet. But don't expect easy answers here--Jeff's generous account of his journey emboldens all of us to step whole-heartedly into the questions and accept the call to adventure that life is offering. This is a book I want every human being, young and old, to pick up and read!' --KELLY MCNELIS, founder of Women For One, and author of Your Messy Brilliance.</p></p><h2>A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family</h2><p><p> From the time she was a toddler, Lou Ann Walker was the ears and voice for her deaf parents. Their family life was warm and loving, but outside the home, they faced a world that misunderstood and often rejected them. </p></p><p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Rearview Mirror</b></p><br><p><i>En Route to Cambridge, Massachusetts<br>September 1973</i></p><p>Mom and Dad drove me out to Harvard the fall I transferred. I'd never been east of Ohio. Looking back now, I know I was frightened. That day it came out as sullenness. I was scared of being a small fish in a big pond, terrified of being looked down on as the hayseed from Indiana. I was convinced that once the Harvard and Radcliffe administrations actually saw me, they would tell me to go home. </p><p>I was looking forward to getting away from home. Not from my parents. I was itching to break away from small-town thinking from plainness, from flat land and houses that looked alike, from the constant interpreting, carrying out business transactions, acting as a go-between for my parents and a world that really didn't have much patience. </p><p>My head was filled with the aura, the stateliness of the Ivy League. Names resonated with import: Currier, Lowell, Winthrop. I could smell and hear things I'd never encountered, but in my imagination I knew they existed, and I felt sure that upon my arrival--if I wasn't sent home--wonderful happenings would occur. I wouldn't be burdened by timidity. No one would know of my mistakes unless I repeated them. </p><p>I'd just spent two years at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, with some vague idea that I wanted to be a teacher of the deaf. When the program turned out to be less than I expected, and when I didn't feel I was getting enough challenge in my other classes, I applied to four eastern colleges and was accepted. Harvard took very few transfers that year--the next year, none were admitted at all--and although the admission officers were very kind to me, all the literature they'd sent warned how difficult it was to switch colleges in midstream. </p><p>Now I looked up at the back of my parents' heads and I sank down low in the car's back seat. Filling out the application, I'd made prominent mention of the fact that they were deaf. The entrance essay, which was supposed to be about me, was actually about them. Many applicants use a father's or grandfather's degree to get them into the family alma mater, but neither of my parents had set foot in a college classroom. The irony that I was shamelessly using my deaf mother and, my deaf father to get into Harvard was not lost on me. Neither was the fact that although I'd willingly and openly tell people they were deaf and I would briefly answer questions, I just wasn't going to say anything else. It was all too complicated. </p><p>Most of the sixteen-hour trip to Cambridge I brooded over a freshman reading list, the kind given out to high school seniors that includes all the books they should have read by the time they matriculate. I'd read very little of what was on that list. When I'd received it in the mail, I had gone to the library, taken out <i>Ulysses,</i> and despaired. I understood nothing. </p><p>I sat in the back seat for hundreds of miles, worrying that I'd have nothing to discuss at the dining table. And every once in a while I'd look up to watch my parents' conversations. </p><p>When the highway was deserted, Dad could comfortably shift his eyes from the road to Mom's hands. When traffic got heavy, he would have to watch the road and then his glances were shorter. If he wanted to pass a car, he'd hold up an index finger at Mom, signaling her to suspend the conversation for a moment. It was always easier for the driver to do the talking, although that meant his signs were shortened and somewhat less graceful. He would use the steering wheel as a base, the way he normally used his left hand; his right hand did all the moving. </p><p>Curled up in the seat, chin dug into my chest, I noticed there was a lull in the conversation. Dad was a confident driver, but Mom was smoking more than usual. </p><p>"Something happened? That gas station?" Mom signed to me. </p><p>"No, nothing," I lied. </p><p>"Are you sure?" </p><p>"Yes. Everything is fine." Dad and I had gone in to pay and get directions. The man behind the counter had looked up, seen me signing and grunted, "Huh, I didn't think mutes were allowed to have driver's licenses." Long ago I'd gotten used to hearing those kinds of comments. But I never could get used to the way they made me chum inside. </p><p>Mom was studying me. Having relied on her visual powers all her life, she knew when I was hiding something. "Are you afraid of going so far away from home? Why don't you stay in Indiana? This distance. Why wasn't college in Indiana good enough?" </p><p>"Mom. No! Cut it out." </p><p>She turned and faced front again, then she tried to distract both of us by pointing out a hex symbol on a barn. </p><p>Dad hadn't seen exactly what either of us said, but he'd caught the speed and force of my signs from the rearview mirror, and he could feel the tension coming from behind him. Mom had struck several nerves in me. Not only was I stepping into foreign territory--I hadn't been able to afford to visit any of the schools to which I'd applied--but also, back home in Indiana, none of my relatives or high school friends had been enthusiastic about my going east. To Hoosiers, Harvard means highbrow and snotty, too good for everyone else. Before I had left, Grandma Wells, my mother's mother, had admonished me, not once but several times, "not to get too big for my britches."</p>&#34;A deeply moving, often humorous, and beautiful account of what it means to be the hearing child of profoundly deaf parents . . . I have rarely read anything on the subject more powerful or poignant than this extraordinary personal account by Lou Ann Walker.&#34;-- Oliver Sacks&#34;[Walker) describes in moving detail the joys of growing up in a family where the simplest communication was never taken for granted.&#34; -- &#34;Newsweek&#34;&#34;In this remarkable memoir, Walker recreates the pain and the joy ofgrowing up between two worlds: her parents&#39; loving but silent home, and theoften confusing world she encountered outside those walls, and of which shewas inevitably a part.&#34; -- &#34;Seattle Times-Post Intelligencer&#34;&#34;I have never thought hard about this before, but now I see that what deaf people do in sign language is even more mysteriously and specifically, biologically human than speech itself. My respect for the deaf, always high, is now still higher. My awe for the human mind is out of sight.&#34; -- Lewis Thomas&#34;Readers will come away from this book informed, deeply moved and full of admiration for Walker&#39;s marvelous parents.&#34;-- &#34;People&#34;&#34;I loved &#34;A Loss for Words.&#34; [The] style is brisk and clear and, it seems to me, never sentimental . . . The Lou Ann who emerges to find her own voice and write this book is a character whom I admire as much as any literary hero.&#34; -- Max Apple&#34;In the end, I wanted to cheer Lou Ann Walker for having thegumption to write about a matter so close to her heart, learning to love and accept her parents as they are, not as she wished them to be. This is a gem of a book.&#34; -- &#34;Glamour&#34;&#34;Beautifully written and deeply affecting . . . There is humor in [Walker&#39;s] recollections but nothinglighthearted in accounts of crude or condescending reactions to her father and mother from indifferent people. Walker is candid in dealing with her own frustrations and the burdens of life with the deaf.&#34; -- &#34;Publishers Weekly&#34;&#34;So profoundly other is the unhearing culture . . . that moving itinto a language we learn by hearing took both gifts and a nearlysavage determination.&#34; -- &#34;New York Times Book Review&#34;This book is worth reading simply for its celebration of the strength and perseverence of the human spirit and for its account of a woman coming to terms with herself and a family coming to terms with itself.&#34;-- &#34;American Annals of the Deaf&#34;</p><h2>The Joy of Bird Feeding: The Essential Guide to Attracting and Feeding Our Backyard Birds</h2><p><i>The Joy of Bird Feeding</i> is the ultimate reference for backyard bird watchers and bird feeders.

The three survivors--a beautiful WAC, a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash, and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food, little water, and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux of <i>Lost in Shangri-La</i>, Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances, <i>Lost in Shangri-La</i> deserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II. <i>--Lynette Mong</i> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides Reviews <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em> </strong> <br> <p><strong> Hampton Sides is the editor-at-large for <em>Outside</em> magazine and the author of the international bestseller <em>Ghost Soldiers</em>, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax film <em>The Great Raid</em>. </strong></p> <strong> </strong> <p>Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&#x2019;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&#x2014;not tales of the &#x201c;ripping good yarn&#x201d; variety. Yet remarkably, in his new book <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em>, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he&#x2019;s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.</p> <p>What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&#x2019;t really a war story&#x2014;not in a strict military sense. It&#x2019;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.</p> <p>The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&#x2019;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have &#x201c;crash-landed in a world that time didn&#x2019;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&#x201d; The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who&#x2019;ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They&#x2019;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &#x201c;removable skin&#x201d; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.</p> <p>The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.</p> <p>What ensues in Zuckoff&#x2019;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become&#x2014;in a guarded, tentative sort of way&#x2014;<em>friends</em>.</p> <p>But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&#x2019;s land between warring Dani tribes&#x2014;a no-man&#x2019;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&#x2019;s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.</p> <p>Yes, there <em>are</em> still a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&#x2019;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&#x2019;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal parts <em>Alive</em>, <em>Cast Away</em>, and <em>The Gods Must Be Crazy</em>. It&#x2019;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&#x2019;t know what to do with themselves&#x2014;and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.</p><p>On May 13, 1945, twenty-four American servicemen and WACs boarded a transport plane for a sightseeing trip over &#x201c;Shangri-La,&#x201d; a beautiful and mysterious valley deep within the jungle-covered mountains of Dutch New Guinea.Unlike the peaceful Tibetan monks of James Hilton&#x2019;s bestselling novel Lost Horizon, this Shangri-La was home to spear-carrying tribesmen, warriors rumored to be cannibals. </p><p>But the pleasure tour became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously, three passengers pulled through. Margaret Hastings, barefoot and burned, had no choice but to wear her dead best friend&#x2019;s shoes. John McCollom, grieving the death of his twin brother also aboard the plane, masked his grief with stoicism. Kenneth Decker, too, was severely burned and suffered a gaping head wound.</p><p>Emotionally devastated, badly injured, and vulnerable to the hidden dangers of the jungle, the trio faced certain death unless they left the crash site. Caught between man-eating headhunters and enemy Japanese, the wounded passengers endured a harrowing hike down the mountainside&#x2014;a journey into the unknown that would lead them straight into a primitive tribe of superstitious natives who had never before seen a white man&#x2014;or woman.</p><p>Drawn from interviews, declassified U.S. Army documents, personal photos and mementos, a survivor&#x2019;s diary, a rescuer&#x2019;s journal, and original film footage, Lost in Shangri-La recounts this incredible true-life adventure for the first time. Mitchell Zuckoff reveals how the determined trio&#x2014;dehydrated, sick, and in pain&#x2014;traversed the dense jungle to find help; how a brave band of paratroopers risked their own lives to save the survivors; and how a cowboy colonel attempted a previously untested rescue mission to get them out.</p><p>By trekking into the New Guinea jungle, visiting remote villages, and rediscovering the crash site, Zuckoff also captures the contemporary natives&#x2019; remembrances of the long-ago day when strange creatures fell from the sky. A riveting work of narrative nonfiction that vividly brings to life an odyssey at times terrifying, enlightening, and comic, Lost in Shangri-La is a thrill ride from beginning to end.</p></p><h2>Kull: Exile of Atlantis</h2><p><b>In a meteoric career that spanned a mere twelve years, Robert E. Howard single-handedly invented the genre that came to be called sword and sorcery. From his fertile imagination sprang some of fiction&#x2019;s most enduring heroes. Yet while Conan is indisputably Howard&#x2019;s greatest creation, it was in his earlier sequence of tales featuring Kull, a fearless warrior with the brooding intellect of a philosopher, that Howard began to develop the distinctive themes, and the richly evocative blend of history and mythology, that would distinguish his later tales of the Hyborian Age.</b><br><br> Much more than simply the prototype for Conan, Kull is a fascinating character in his own right: an exile from fabled Atlantis who wins the crown of Valusia, only to find it as much a burden as a prize.<br><br> This groundbreaking collection, lavishly illustrated by award-winning artist Justin Sweet, gathers together all Howard&#x2019;s stories featuring Kull, from Kull&#x2019; s first published appearance, in &#x201c;The Shadow Kingdom,&#x201d; to &#x201c;Kings of the Night,&#x201d; Howard&#x2019; s last tale featuring the cerebral swordsman. The stories are presented just as Howard wrote them, with all subsequent editorial emendations removed. Also included are previously unpublished stories, drafts, and fragments, plus extensive notes on the texts, an introduction by Howard authority Steve Tompkins, and an essay by noted editor Patrice Louinet. <br> <b><br>Praise for <i>Kull</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Robert E. Howard had a gritty, vibrant style&#x2013;broadsword writing that cut its way to the heart, with heroes who are truly larger than life.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;David Gemmell<br></b><br>&#x201c;Howard&#x2019;s writing seems so highly charged with energy that it nearly gives off sparks.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Stephen King</b><br><br> &#x201c;Howard was a true storyteller&#x2013;one of the first, and certainly among the best, you&#x2019;ll find in heroic fantasy. If you&#x2019;ve never read him before, you&#x2019; re in for a real treat.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Charles de Lint<br></b> <br> &#x201c;For stark, living fear . . . what other writer is even in the running with Robert E. Howard?&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;H. P. Lovecraft<br></b></p><p>As some cover blurbs so rightly state, "Before Conan--there was Kull!" The warrior Kull was yet another popular creation of pulp writer Robert E. Howard (1906-1936), generally credited as the originator of the subgenre heroic fantasy. Yet Kull should not be dismissed as second-rate Conan. (Although Howard did transform a few unsold Kull adventures into those of Conan the Cimmerian when the later series took off with the public.) Set in ancient, lost Atlantis, the Kull stories take place mostly after the barbarian has already come to power as King Kull of Valusia. What makes these scant dozen stories most memorable is Howard's heightened style of mystical decadence, similar here to his <i>Weird Tales</i> contemporary, Clark Ashton Smith. Rest assured there's enough gruesome bloodletting and wanton savagery to satisfy the most ardent Howard reader. (Variant editions of this collection have been published over the years, with the uncompleted stories finished posthumously by Lin Carter. Other editions have simply presented the few story fragments as untouched--and unadulterated--Robert E. Howard.) <i>--Stanley Wiater</i><b>Robert E. Howard</b>&nbsp;was one of the most prolific short story writers in American history, and has created such beloved characters as Conan the Barbarian, Kull of Atlantis, Soloman Kane, Bran Mak Morn, El Borak, and Dark Agn�s de Chastillon.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p>Chapter VII<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Book&#x2019;ry, Cook&#x2019;ry<br>&nbsp;<br>She learned to bake and to roast, to mend and to scrub. She learned to sew and to knit. She helped her mother tend the garden. She learned to dye.1 She helped her father in the shop, doing the work that her brother hated, &#x201c;cutting Wick for the Candles, filling the Dipping Mold, and the Molds for cast Candles.&#x201d;2<br>&nbsp;<br>What more could she study? A Boston newspaper printed &#x201c;A Dialogue between a thriving Tradesman and his Wife about the Education of Their Daughter.&#x201d; The wife wishes to send the girl to school. The husband refuses, telling her:<br>&nbsp;<br>Prithee, good Madam, let her first be able,<br>To read a Chapter truly, in the Bible, <br>That she may&#x2019;nt mispronounce God&#x2019;s People, Popel, <br>Nor read Cunstable for Constantinople; <br>Make her expert and ready at her Prayers, <br>That God may keep her from the Devils Snares; <br>Teach her what&#x2019;s useful, how to shun deluding, <br>To roast, to toast, to boil and mix a Pudding. <br>To knit, to spin, to sew, to make or mend, <br>To scrub, to rub, to earn and not to spend, <br>I tell thee Wife, once more, I&#x2019;ll have her bred <br>To Book&#x2019;ry, Cook&#x2019;ry, Thimble, Needle, Thread.3<br>&nbsp;<br>That Jane Franklin learned to write as well as she did was a twist of fate: she was her brother&#x2019;s sister. Mostly, she learned other things. She was bred to bookery and cookery, needle and thread.<br>&nbsp;<br>She learned how to make soap. She once wrote down the family recipe. In a wooden box with a hole bored in the bottom and set over a tub filled with bricks, soak eighteen bushels of ashes and one bushel of lime with water. Leach lye. Then, in a copper pot, boil the lye with wax&#x2014;&#x201c;won third mirtle wax two thirds clean tallow the Greener the wax the beter,&#x201d; she wrote&#x2014;and keep it from boiling over &#x201c;by flirting the froith with a scimer.&#x201d; Stir in salt. &#x201c;Be carefull not to Put two much salt in it will make it Britle.&#x201d; Line a mold with a cloth (&#x201c;not too coars&#x201d;) and pour in the boiling soap: &#x201c;keep it smoth on the top take care to let your Frame stand on a Level let care be taken when it is in that it Is not Jogd.&#x201d; Let it set overnight, and in the morning cut it &#x201c;with a small wier fixed to a round stick at Each End.&#x201d; Use a gauge to make sure each cake is of equal weight and, if not, &#x201c;Pare it fitt.&#x201d;4<br>&nbsp;<br>She lived a life of confinement. She never learned to ride. (&#x201c;I hant courage to ride a hors,&#x201d; she once admitted.)5 If she left the city, it was with her mother, by boat, to visit the Folgers on Nantucket, where she played with her cousin Keziah.6 She spent her Sundays at the Old South Meeting House, listening to men&#x2019;s voices thundering from the pulpit. She ran errands, to the shops, to the docks, and to James&#x2019;s printing house, to visit her brothers. She visited her married sisters and helped care for their children, or they for her: some of her nieces and nephews were older than she was. She loved best her niece Grace.7<br>&nbsp;<br>Most days she spent at home, close to the fire. She was curious, and she could be untoward. But she was dutiful. She was pared to fit.<br>&nbsp;<br>A girl&#x2019;s apprenticeship was girlhood itself. A boy&#x2019;s apprenticeship was a trade. In 1717, when Jane was five, her brother James came back from England and set up a printing shop in Boston, &#x201c;over against the Prison in Queen Street.&#x201d;8 It was a godsend. Here at last was a trade for Benjamin, the bookish boy too poor to go to Harvard. In 1718, he became his brother&#x2019;s apprentice: a printer&#x2019;s devil. He moved into a room above James&#x2019;s shop. Benny was twelve; Jenny was six.<br>&nbsp;<br>The best part of his apprenticeship, Franklin always said, was the chance it gave him to read. At the Blue Ball, he had only ever found in his father&#x2019;s library a few books he liked: Plutarch&#x2019;s Lives, &#x201c;a Book of Defoe&#x2019;s called an Essay on Projects and another of Dr. Mather&#x2019;s call&#x2019;d Essays to do Good.&#x201d; But working at a printer&#x2019;s shop was almost as good as working at a bookshop. &#x201c;I now had Access to better Books,&#x201d; he remembered. &#x201c;An Acquaintance with the Apprentices of Booksellers, enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often I sat up in my Room reading the greatest Part of the Night.&#x201d;9<br>&nbsp;<br>Jane Colman read all night long, too. Her father&#x2019;s house was stocked with books. She read &#x201c;all the English Poetry, and polite Pieces in Prose, printed and Manuscripts in her Father&#x2019;s well furnish&#x2019;d Library, and much she borrow&#x2019;d of her Friends and Acquaintance. She had indeed such a Thirst after Knowledge that the Leisure of the Day did not suffice, but she spent whole Nights in reading.&#x201d;10<br>&nbsp;<br>Jane Franklin enjoyed neither the leisure of a minister&#x2019;s daughter nor the library of a printer&#x2019;s apprentice. What books she read were what books she found in the house of a poor soap boiler. &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s little Library consisted chiefly of Books in polemic Divinity,&#x201d; her brother had written. Her world of learning widened so far, and no farther.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her brother resolved to be his own tutor. Determined to become a good writer, he trained himself by reading. The boy who wanted to become the author of his own life taught himself to write by copying the prose style he found in the Spectator. &#x201c;I thought the Writing excellent, and wish&#x2019;d if possible to imitate it,&#x201d; he explained. He read an essay, wrote an abstract, and then rewrote the argument from the abstract, to see if he could improve on the original. Then he rewrote the essays as poems since, he thought, &#x201c;nothing acquaints a Lad so speedily with Variety of Expression, as the Necessity of finding such Words and Phrases as will suit with the Measure, Sound and Rhime of Verse, and at the same Time well express the Sentiment.&#x201d; He wrote rules, pledging himself to brevity (&#x201c;a multitude of Words obscure the Sense&#x201d;), clarity (&#x201c;To write clearly, not only the most expressive, but the plainest Words should be chosen&#x201d;), and simplicity: &#x201c;If a Man would that his Writings have an Effect on the Generality of Readers, he had better imitate that Gentleman, who would use no Word in his Works that was not well understood by his Cook-maid.&#x201d; His cook-maid . . . or his little sister.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Prose Writing has been of great Use to me in the Course of my Life,&#x201d; Franklin knew, &#x201c;and was a principal Means of my Advancement.&#x201d; He would write his way up, and out.11<br>&nbsp;<br>Reading, he grew skeptical of his family&#x2019;s faith. The more books he read, the less he believed the Bible. &#x201c;I was scarce 15,&#x201d; he remembered, &#x201c;when, after doubting by turns of several Points as I found them disputed in the different Books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He discovered, too, that he liked to argue. &#x201c;My indiscrete Disputations about Religion began to make me pointed at with Horror by good People, as an Infidel or Atheist.&#x201d; He especially liked to debate, like &#x201c;University Men,&#x201d; with &#x201c;another Bookish Lad in the Town, John Collins by Name.&#x201d; They once debated &#x201c;the Propriety of educating the Female Sex in Learning, and their Abilities for Study.&#x201d; Young Collins &#x201c;was of Opinion that it was improper&#x201d; and that girls &#x201c;were naturally unequal to it.&#x201d; Franklin disagreed: &#x201c;I took the contrary Side, perhaps a little for Disputes sake.&#x201d;12<br>&nbsp;<br>In crafting his argument, Franklin leaned on Defoe&#x2019;s Essay on Projects, one of the few books in his father&#x2019;s library that he liked. Defoe had proposed the establishment of an &#x201c;Academy for Women&#x201d;: &#x201c;I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous Customs in the world, consider- ing us as a Civilised and a Christian Countrey, that we deny the advantages of Learning to Women.&#x201d; Like Astell, Defoe regretted the frivolousness of girls&#x2019; education: &#x201c;Their youth is spent to teach them to Stitch and Sew, or make Bawbles. They are taught to Read indeed, and perhaps to Write their Names, or so; and that is the heighth of a Woman&#x2019;s Education.&#x201d; His Academy for Women was to embrace every subject: &#x201c;To such whose Genius wou&#x2019;d lead them to it, I wou&#x2019;d deny no sort of Learning.&#x201d;13<br>&nbsp;<br>But, for all his Defoe, Franklin didn&#x2019;t win the argument. Collins, he admitted, &#x201c;was naturally more eloquent, had a ready Plenty of Words, and sometimes . . . bore me down more by his Fluency than by the Strength of his Reasons.&#x201d; They parted without settling the question and continued the debate by letters. &#x201c;Three or four Letters of a Side had pass&#x2019;d,&#x201d; Franklin wrote, &#x201c;when my Father happen&#x2019;d to find my Papers, and read them. Without entering into the Discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the Manner of my Writing, observ&#x2019;d that tho&#x2019; I had the Advantage of my Antagonist in correct Spelling and pointing (which I ow&#x2019;d to the Printing House) I fell far short in elegance of Expression, in Method and in Perspicuity.&#x201d;14<br>&nbsp;<br>Spelling and pointing (punctuating) were genteel accomplishments; they date to the rise of printing. People used to spell however they pleased, even spelling their own names differently from one day to the next. Then came the printing press, and rules for printers: how to spell, how to point. More books meant more readers; more readers meant more writers. But only the learned, only the lettered, knew how to spell.<br>&nbsp;<br>Franklin was a better speller than his friend Collins, and he could point better, too, but Collins proved a better debater. Be more precise, Josiah urged his son. Be plainer. On the question itself, he did not venture an opinion.<br>&nbsp;<br>While Benny was improving his writing by arguing about the education of girls, Jenny was at home, boiling soap and stitching. Quietly, with what time she could find, she did more. She once confided to her brother, &#x201c;I Read as much as I Dare.&#x201d;15<br>&nbsp;<br>1. &#x201c;With all my own art &amp; good old unkle Benjamins memorandoms I cant make them good colors,&#x201d; JFM wrote to her brother in 1766, suggesting that, at least at that point, she had his book of memorandums, or recipes. JFM to BF, November 8, 1766. (And she certainly owned his books of poetry, one of which is inscribed with her name.) The original of the recipe book is either lost or in private hands; all that survives is a transcription.

She wrote the recipe down twice. (BF lost it; see Van Doren, Letters, 129.) JFM, &#x201c;For Making Crown Soap,&#x201d; 1772, in Letters, 130&#x2013;32. And JFM, &#x201c;Recipe for Crown Soap,&#x201d; 1786, PBF, unpublished. I&#x2019;m not certain that the dates assigned to these recipes are especially plausible. The first seems to have been written down after the death of John Franklin, to whom JFM must have been referring when she wrote, &#x201c;My Brother in His Life time tould me it could not be conveyd by Recipt&#x201d; (that is, that you couldn&#x2019;t write down this recipe; you needed to learn by doing). The original is Jane Franklin Mecom, Recipe for Crown Soap, n.d., Hays Calendar IV, 376, Franklin Papers, vol. 58, folio 19. Van Doren credited the invention of crown soap to John Franklin, without any substantiation. But as Huang has remarked, there is every reason to believe that Josiah, who trained his son, was involved in perfecting the soap (&#x201c;Franklin&#x2019;s Father Josiah,&#x201d; 43&#x2013;45). And as Lemay argues, Abiah must have been involved (Life of BF, 1:56) and it&#x2019;s highly probable that Jane was intimately involved as well, which would also account for her subsequent frustration at her sons&#x2019; being kept out of the soap business. Jane herself gave some credit to her brother John. In one letter to Franklin, she refers to their brother John as &#x201c;the Inventor&#x201d; of crown soap, but in the same letter she explains that he had nearly as much difficulty getting it right as she did. &#x201c;The Labour is Grate, &amp; the operation critical, the Exact knolidg not to be attained without Expearance, my Brother Him self tould me it workd some times not to his mind in a way he could not account for&#x201d; (JFM to BF, December 29, 1780). When sending her own soap to Franklin in 1786, and apologizing that it wasn&#x2019;t exactly as fine as she had hoped, she wrote, &#x201c;I beleve my Brother John Perfectly understood the Exact proportion that would do best&#x201d; (JFM to BF, May 29, 1786). Yet this letter does not place John so far above herself, as a soap boiler; instead, it substantiates an argument that she and her brother knew very well how to make soap even if, at the age of sixty-four, she was having a hard time remembering the exact proportions to use.<br>5. JFM to BF, September 12, 1779. <br>6. Keziah Folger was born on Nantucket on October 9, 1723, when Jane was eleven. Keziah&#x2019;s father, Daniel Folger, was Abiah Folger Franklin&#x2019;s cousin, and her mother, Abigail Folger, was actually another cousin of Abiah Folger Franklin&#x2019;s. Useful information about Keziah Folger Coffin was gathered by Jared Sparks in the 1830s. In 1838, William Folger of Nantucket wrote to Sparks, about Franklin, that &#x201c;her parents being so nearly related to each other the Doctor used to say, that he considered Kezia as an own cousin.&#x201d; Jared Sparks, &#x201c;Papers sent to me by William C.

Sparks also visited Nantucket, in 1826; see his diary entry for October 10, 1826, in MS Sparks 141c. Keziah Folger married John Coffin in 1746. She and Jane remained close until the American Revolution. Franklin also corresponded with Keziah, though much less frequently, it appears, than Jane did. On Keziah Folger Coffin, see Nathaniel Philbrick, Away Off Shore: Nantucket Island and Its People, 1602&#x2013;1890 (Nantucket: Mill Hill Press, 1994), 123&#x2013;33, and Betsy Tyler, Sometimes Think of Me: Notable Nantucket Women Through the Centuries (Nantucket: Nantucket Historical Association, 2010), 11&#x2013;17.

Grace Harris was born on August 3, 1718, the daughter of Jane&#x2019;s sister Anne and her husband William Harris of Ipswich (PBF, 1:lvii). In 1746, Grace Harris married Jonathan Williams of Boston.

What was once the pinnacle of achievement in a runner's life is now a stepping stone for extraordinary adventure in ultramarathoning. The number of ultrarunners--those running distances of 50k (31 miles), 50 miles, 100k (62 miles), or 100 miles--is growing astronomically each year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dean Karnazes' <i>Ultramarathon Man </i>and Chris McDougall's <i>Born to Run </i>have inspired tens of thousands to try these seemingly superhuman distances. But to date, there has been no practical guide to ultramarathoning. Now, Bryon Powell has written <i>Relentless Forward Progress, </i>the first how-to manual for aspiring ultrarunners. Powell covers every aspect of training for and racing ultra distances. Along the way, more than a dozen elites and experts, including Geoff Roes, Krissy Moehl, Michael Wardian, Dave Mackey, and David Horton, provide invaluable advice on running ultramarathons. By its conclusion, this encyclopedic volume prepares runners for going farther than they have ever gone before and, in the process, shows them that they are capable of the "impossible."&nbsp;</p><p><b>Bryon Powell</b> is a former Washington, DC, attorney who left his job to devote himself to running ultramarathons full time. He publishes the popular trail running and ultrarunning website iRunFar.com, and competes in ultras nationwide. His articles have also been published in <i>Outside</i>, <i>Running Times</i>, <i>Trail Runner</i>, <i>Competitor</i>, and <i>UltraRunning</i>. Bryon is a contributing editor at <i>Trail Runner</i> and is an advisory board member of the American Trail Running Association. He lives in Park City, Utah. As a runner, he has twice placed in the top ten at the Leadville 100 ('06 &amp; '09), twice won the under-30 age group at the Western States 100 ('05 &amp; '06), and was part of the first American team to place in the top three at Morocco's Marathon des Sables ('09).<b> </b><br>1<br>SO YOU WANT TO RUN AN ULTRAMARATHON!<br><br>What Is an Ultramarathon?<br><br>What is an ultramarathon anyway? Does it require you to run 100 miles over mountain trails in a race such as the Western States Endurance Run or to suffer through 135 road miles in the furnace-like heat of the Badwater Ultramarathon? No. Simply, an ultramarathon is any race longer than the marathon&#x2019;s 26 miles and 385 yards.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve completed a marathon and have run a few additional yards before, during, or after the race, then you&#x2019;ve completed an ultramarathon. If you&#x2019;ve taken a wrong turn on a long training run and, through a combination of running and walking, have covered more than 26.2 miles, then you, too, could call yourself an ultra-marathoner.<br><br>Still, while both of the above scenarios technically make you an ultramarathoner, it would be somewhat disingenuous to call yourself one after such an effort. As you learn after spending time around other ultramarathoners, the sport is built upon community and the spirit of the sport,&#x201d; rather than self-recognition and technicalities.<br><br>With that in mind, there&#x2019;s a second, implicit criterion that should be met before calling yourself an ultramarathoner: the intent to complete an ultra distance. Secondarily and with a nod to the disfavor of technicalities in ultrarunning, the intended distance should be an appreciable distance longer than the marathon. Sorry, but setting out with the aim to run 26.3 miles just doesn&#x2019;t sit right.<br><br>For most runners, 50-kilometer (31.1-mile) races are the gateway into ultras,&#x201d; as ultramarathons are commonly known. Those seeking to test themselves with a first ultramarathon at the shorter end of the race spectrum are in luck, as the 50k distance is the most frequently raced ultra distance in most locales. To give you an idea of the prevalence of 50ks, in 2010, well in excess of 200 of them were run in the United States, while 60 were run in California alone. Other runners use time-based races of 6- or 12-hour duration to ease into the requisite distance.<br><br>To be clear, you need not run a race to have run an ultramarathon. For instance, you could meet up with a running club for an ultra-distance fat ass&#x201d; event. Traditionally, fat ass events carry some variation on the disclaimer, No fees, no awards, no aid, no wimps.&#x201d; While the disclaimer may make it sound like fat ass events are no place for running a first ultra, many such events do have limited aid, and their non-competitive nature provides even more collegiality than normally found in the friendly world of ultras. If you prefer solitude, create your own first ultra, whether it involves running laps around your neighborhood or a daylong wilderness adventure run.<br><br>All that said, most runners prefer to break the ultra barrier in an official race before calling themselves ultrarunners. If you&#x2019;ve run a marathon, you may understand the inherent feeling of accomplishment of reaching a true finish line. That feeling is repeated in your first ultra. Satisfaction lies in the act of crossing the finish line, receiving a finisher&#x2019;s award, and forever after being able to say, I ran my first ultra at XYZ Race.&#x201d; Before race day, having a race on your calendar keeps you motivated to train when any of a countless number of detractors, from work and family, to weather and illness, threaten to derail it. At the race itself, you have a built-in supply network of aid stations, while volunteers, spectators, and fellow competitors aid you in your journey beyond the marathon.<br>Why Run an Ultramarathon?<br><br>You may still be considering whether or not you want to train for an ultra or perhaps you&#x2019;re looking for some reassurance for continuing to do so. While it is unlikely that training for and racing an ultramarathon will be easy throughout, there are many reasons to run an ultra, whether it&#x2019;s your 1st or 40th.<br><br>For starters, if this will be your first ultramarathon, you will experience a journey into the unknown. The ultramarathon represents a new challenge in attempting to run farther than you ever have before. Rest assured that the challenge is both physical and mental. Find out if you have what it takes.<br>The complicated and unpredictable nature of ultramarathons can, somewhat counterintuitively, help you reconnect with running. Devon Crosby-Helms, winner of the 2008 Vermont 100-miler, suggests, A good reason to switch from marathons [to ultras] is because in ultras you have to think about more than just splits and ticking off miles at a certain pace. I think it reconnects you with running in a way that marathoning doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Training for and racing ultramarathons also connects you with a new group of friends. Most folks who have crossed over from subultradistance road racing have found a tight-knit but welcoming community. Ultrarunners are often eager to share the trail with anyone dipping his or her toe into the ultra world. Not only are these runners welcoming, they are an invaluable resource. Coach Lisa Smith-Batchen suggests to new ultrarunners, Find a group of people that are already running on the trails so they can help you.&#x201d; Likewise, if you&#x2019;re training for a road ultra, find some folks training for one. Don&#x2019;t worry if you&#x2019;re already active in a running club or community; many ultrarunners enjoy the company of multiple running groups. Variety is the spice of life, after all!<br><br>American runners spend the vast majority of their running miles pounding the pavement. On the other hand, most North American ultramarathons are run on trails, so getting ready for one is a great excuse to get off the pavement and up into the hills. While you&#x2019;re up there you might just see spectacular things. Scotty Mills, who has run ultras for more than a quarter century, notes, The advantages of training for trail ultras over road marathons are the beauty of the trails, the shared trail time in remote areas, and the peaceful feeling of training with the mind-set that you can run forever.&#x201d;<br><br>Running an ultra also provides a great break from competitive pressures, while still giving you a goal to shoot for. It&#x2019;s easy to get caught up in racing when there are 10,000 runners blasting down the course with you. The smaller fields, longer distances, and variable conditions of ultras help shift your competition from others to yourself. Knowing that others are thinking the same way makes this transition all the easier. Plus, if it&#x2019;s your first ultra, you&#x2019;ll set a PR no matter how long it takes you to finish! Finally, as Mills points out, The training and friends you make in ultrarunning are the real payoffs; the race itself can almost be secondary in importance.&#x201d;<br><br>In attempting to do what so few people have done, you may end up inspiring yourself. The mind is a very powerful thing, and it&#x2019;s generally the only thing standing between you and something incredible. You can always do more than you think you can,&#x201d; suggests ultra-convert Paige Troelstrup. In a similar vein, Leadville Trail 100-mile founder Ken Choulber is often heard reminding runners, You&#x2019;re tougher than you think you are, and you can do more than you think you can.&#x201d; Go find out if Ken is right!<br>How to Use This Book to Run an Ultramarathon<br><br>Whatever your reasons, you&#x2019;ve come to this book in search of guidance for running an ultramarathon, perhaps your first and that is what you&#x2019;ll find. This book begins by providing a basic framework for ultramarathon training. Following this foundation, you will find training plans for 50ks (31 miles), moderate-distance ultras of 40 miles to 100k (62 miles), and longer ultras of 100 miles and beyond. You&#x2019;ll also receive a concise education on trail running, a vital component of most ultramarathons.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll learn many lessons en route to a successful ultramarathon. These lessons can be slowly and sometimes painfully self-taught through trial and error. This books aims to shorten the learning process and minimize unneeded suffering by instructing you regarding the ins and outs of ultramarathon hydration and nutrition. Even if you consume the correct fluid and fuel to keep you going on the course, injuries and other challenges can be a quick way to a DNF (did not finish), so they are covered, too. You&#x2019;ll also want the right gear while training and racing, so that&#x2019;s covered, as well.<br><br>Once you have the tools and training, it&#x2019;s time to attempt your first ultramarathon. Learn how to prepare for race day and how to approach the race itself. In general, the nutrition, required gear, pacing, environmental conditions, and time on your feet for an ultra differ significantly even from a marathon. In fact, environmental conditions, from blistering heat to breath-stealing altitude, are encountered often enough in ultras to warrant a chapter of their own.<br><br>Last but not least, this book offers a few options for exploring and then expanding the world of ultramarathons. Ultras are a social phenomenon; chapter 14 touches on various ways for sharing your journey with others, and points out community-based resources. Finally, the afterword examines variations on the ultramarathon theme, including adventure runs, endurance snowshoeing, fast-packing, and stage races.<br><br>Ultrarunning elites and subject area experts have weighed in with their advice to help round out the pages of this book. The widely varying contributions are presented in each runner&#x2019;s own voice from Krissy Moehl&#x2019;s inspirational essay on why you should run an ultra to Karl King&#x2019;s technical insight on hydration and electrolyte balance and from David Horton&#x2019;s decades-long perspective on how to prepare for your first ultra to Dakota Jones&#x2019; fresh take on trail stewardship.

With all the talk about young Christians being disenchanted with the local church, it is refreshing to hear Brett McCracken, a Millennial, speak so affirmatively on her behalf. I am moved by Brett&#x2019;s grown-up perspective in these pages, a perspective that champions the church as a family not a club, a sinner&#x2019;s hospital not a social network, and a commitment not a consumer product. For any serious Christian, Brett&#x2019;s words are a wake-up call to engage&#x2015;indeed, to love and devote ourselves to&#x2015;this often messy, high-maintenance, painfully ordinary but also glorious, life-giving, and forever-beloved band of misfits that Jesus calls his wife. If Jesus has so tethered himself to the church, dare we untether ourselves from her? Thank you, Brett, for reminding us that Jesus and his wife come to us as a package deal.

Church is supposed to be uncomfortable!&#x2019; That&#x2019;s because McCracken knows it&#x2019;s precisely in embracing the uncomfortable truths of the gospel and immersing ourselves in the uncomfortable unity-in-diversity of the body that we are transformed into the image of Christ&#x2015;the God who endured the discomfort of the cross to bring us resurrection life. In that sense, <i>Uncomfortable</i> is a sharp application of Christ&#x2019;s perennial call to come and die to the particular temptations of the North American church. A helpful corrective and an ultimately hopeful invitation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Derek Rishmawy</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;blogger, <em>Reformedish</em>; cohost, <em>Mere Fidelity</em> podcast</p><p>&#x201c;As an inhabitant of the Western world, I take comfort for granted, and I like it that way. I expect to wear comfortable clothes, sleep in a comfortable bed, and have comforting food in the refrigerator. All my cultural conditioning teaches me to expect&#x2015;and demand&#x2015;comfort. Yet as a pastor and a disciple, I know that the demands of the gospel, while ultimately comforting, frequently are not comfortable. In this excellent book, Brett McCracken identifies and prods around many of the things that make Christian community uncomfortable: he had me itching and scratching! Brett demonstrates how rather than fleeing discomfort we need to lean into it, and in so doing find what is more deeply satisfying than the shallow comforts of our consumer age. I encourage you to read this book and embrace the itch!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Matthew Hosier</strong><strong>,</strong> pastor, Gateway Church, Poole, United Kingdom; contributor, <em>thinktheology</em> blog</p><p>&#x201c;What if not only our answers but our questions are wrong?

Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California; Host, <em>White Horse Inn</em>; author, <em>Core Christianity</em></p><p>&#x201c;We live in a culture oriented entirely toward comfort, and the church is not immune from its lure. Brett McCracken offers a timely and needed reminder that the call for Christians is a different one, but one that brings blessings richer than mere comfort. <i>Uncomfortable</i> will make you uncomfortable in the best of ways. Every believer needs to read this book and heed its call.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Karen Swallow Prior</strong><strong>,</strong> author, <em>On Reading Well: Finding the Good Life through Great Books</em></p><p>&#x201c;Americans are experts at avoiding the uncomfortable&#x2015;be it awkward conversations, conflicted relationships, or lifestyle changes. But Jesus points us to a better way. In this book, McCracken shows us how the greatest glories for disciples of Jesus are often found in the most uncomfortable places his voice calls us and how the real church is not an idealized utopia beyond the fray of history, but rather Jesus powerfully present among his often muddled, messy, and awkward&#x2015;yes, uncomfortable&#x2015;bands of followers today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joshua Ryan Butler</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor, Imago Dei Community, Portland, Oregon; author, <em>The Skeletons in God&#x2019;s Closet</em> and <em>The Pursuing God</em></p><p>&#x201c;Brett McCracken challenges us to face one of the greatest fears of contemporary culture: discomfort. Rather than retreating into a soothing world where everyone&#x2019;s &#x2018;just like me&#x2019; or embracing the distractions of technology and consumerism, Brett calls us to life in community with God&#x2019;s people, where awkwardness, disappointment, and frustration are the norm. It&#x2019;s in this way of life&#x2015;embracing the uncomfortable&#x2015;that we&#x2019;ll find the richest experience of God&#x2019;s grace and the community our hearts truly desire. In a world where church is often just one more consumeristic choice, this is a much-needed book.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Mike Cosper</strong><strong>, </strong>Founder and Director, Harbor Institute for Faith and Culture</p><p>&#x201c;Ahhhh, comfort. It&#x2019;s the siren call to our human hearts, beckoning us to find, acquire, and maintain lives of ease. Such a bent, however, is incompatible with a vibrant Christian faith lived within a thriving Christian community. In <i>Uncomfortable</i>, Brett McCracken alerts us to the toxic ways comfort infects and hinders our faith&#x2015;and how God meets our heart&#x2019;s desire for comfort in gloriously unexpected ways. McCracken urges us to seek something greater than comfort: true life and true faith in Christ, found just beyond the borders of our comfort zone.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Erin Straza</strong><strong>,</strong> author, <em>Comfort Detox</em>; managing editor, <em>Christ and Pop Culture</em></p><p>&#x201c;Anyone who looks closely at modern Christian life can see signs of the insidious self-centeredness by which we sinners are tempted to transform the gospel into something that suits our tastes and fits our plans. McCracken carries out that close examination; in fact, in this book he equips us to pursue that false comfort into all of its hiding places and root it out in Jesus&#x2019;s name and for the sake of the gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Fred Sanders</strong><strong>, </strong>Professor of Theology, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University;&nbsp;author, <em>The Deep Things of God</em></p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes church feels like an annoying family member you would rather see only at Thanksgiving and Christmas. We want a church that is cool and suits our tastes, not the frustrating institution that carries around the &#x2018;shame of the cross.&#x2019; Brett&#x2019;s smoothly written book has cast all the awkwardness of church into a new and meaningful light for me. Like a Puritan voice for the cool, anti-institutional, twenty-first-century Christian, Brett charges his readers to stay and commit to the church as Christ&#x2019;s bride.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Emily Belz</strong><strong>,</strong> journalist, <em>World</em>&nbsp;magazine</p><p>&#x201c;In an anti-institutional age, many wandering souls are hungry for something bigger than themselves. Brett McCracken&#x2019;s vision of the church points us to this reality, which is rarely what we expect and always what we need.

It grounds us instead in what church really is&#x2015;a place where we are called to love our fellow sinners and be loved by them, acknowledging our shared sinfulness even while we challenge each other to leave it behind. For all who care about the church, this is invaluable reading.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gina Dalfonzo</strong><strong>,</strong> author, <em>One by One: Welcoming the Singles in Your Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;As C. S. Lewis reminded us, if we want a comfortable faith, we best not give ourselves to Jesus Christ. But if we want a faith grounded in ultimate reality, and one that matures and therefore ennobles us, then Jesus is indeed the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In this book, Brett McCracken not only &#x2018;counts the cost&#x2019; of life in Christ, but also shows why this uncomfortable life is also the most blessed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Galli</strong><strong>,</strong> Editor in Chief, <em>Christianity Today</em></p></p><h2>Before She was Harriet (Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor Books)</h2><p><i><b>Who was Harriet Tubman before she was Harriet?</b></i><br><br>We know her today as Harriet Tubman, but in her lifetime she was called by many names.

Hammond and Christina Scull examine Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece chapter by chapter, offering expert insights into its evolution, structure, and meaning. They discuss in close detail important literary and historical influences on the development of The Lord of the Rings, connections between that work and other writings by Tolkien, errors and inconsistencies, significant changes to the text during its fifty years of publication, archaic and unusual words used by Tolkien, and words and passages in his invented languages of Middle-earth. Thousands of notes, keyed to standard editions of The Lord of the Rings but universally accessible, reveal the richness and complexity of one of the most popular works of fiction in our time. In addition to their own expertise and that of other scholars and critics, Hammond and Scull frequently draw upon comments by Tolkien himself, made in letters to family, friends, and enthusiasts, in draft texts of The Lord of the Rings, and in works written in later years which amplify or illuminate characters and events in the story. Extensive reference is made also to writings by Tolkien not previously or widely published, including elaborate time-schemes, an unfinished manuscript index to The Lord of the Rings, and most notably, the important Nomenclature or guide to names in The Lord of the Rings prepared for the use of translators, long out of print and now newly transcribed and printed in its entirety. With these resources at hand, even the most seasoned reader of The Lord of the Rings will come to a greater enjoyment and appreciation of Tolkien&#39;s magnificent achievement.</p><p>WAYNE G.

Like a shadow creeping past a doorway in an empty house, or the turn of the latch on a locked door, the movement outside Edith&#x2019;s opened attic window raised the gooseflesh along her spine. Her breath sat in her mouth, suspended with anticipation as icy pinpricks marched down her limbs.<br><br> Her gaze moved from her paintbrush and the tiny drop of red paint she&#x2019;d drizzled onto the chest of the doll&#x2019;s starched white cotton nightgown, to the sea-glass wind chime she&#x2019;d made and hung just outside the window. The stagnant air of a South Carolina summer had stifled any movement for months, yet now the chimes seemed to shiver on an invisible breeze, the frosty blue and green glass twitching like a hanged man from a noose.<br><br> She jerked her gaze to the locked door, wondering whether her husband had returned. He didn&#x2019;t like locked doors. The bruises on her arms, carefully placed and easily hidden under long sleeves, seemed to press against her skin in memory. Edith dropped her paintbrush, barely aware of the splatter of red paint on the dollhouse-size room she&#x2019;d been re-creating, eager to unlatch the door and make it down to the kitchen and her mending basket before Calhoun had cause to wonder where she was.<br><br> She&#x2019;d barely slid from her stool when the sky exploded with fire, illuminating the river and the marshes beneath it, obliterating the stars, and shooting blurry light through the milky glass of the wind chime. The stones swayed with the shocked air, singing sweetly despite the destruction in the sky behind them. Then a rain of fire descended like fireworks, myriad balls of light extinguished as soon as they collided with water into hiccups of steam.<br><br> Smaller explosions reverberated across the river, where the migrant workers&#x2019; cottages clustered near the shore like birds, their roofs and dry postage-stamp lawns easy fodder for the hungry flames that fell from the heavens. A fire siren whirred as Edith leaned out the window as far as she could, listening to people shouting and screaming, and smelling something indiscernible. Something that smelled like the tang of wood smoke mixed with the acrid odor of burning fuel. She recalled the hum of an airplane from when she&#x2019;d been working on the doll, right before she&#x2019;d thought the earth had shifted, and imagined she knew what was now falling from the sky.<br><br> A thud came from above her head, followed swiftly by the sound of something heavy sliding down the roof before hitting the gutter. Then the sound stopped and she pictured whatever it was falling into the back garden.<br><br> Edith ran from the room, ignoring the shoe-size bruises on her hips that made it hard to walk, sliding down half the flight of stairs to the second story, where her three-year-old son, C.J., lay in his bed, blissfully unaware of the sky falling down around them. She scooped him into her arms, along with the baby blanket he&#x2019;d worn thin but wouldn&#x2019;t give up, feeling his warm, sweaty skin against her own. Ignoring his whimpers, she moved as quickly as she could with the boy in her arms down to the foyer.<br><br> Edith threw open the front door to stand on her wide columned porch and stared past her garden and across the street to where the river seemed to bleed in reverse with rising steam. Her neighbors streamed toward the water, as if all the trauma were occurring somewhere else and not in their own backyards. She made her way to the street, but instead of following her neighbors she turned around to inspect her roof, expecting to see it lit with flames.<br><br> Instead she was met with the same sight she&#x2019;d been seeing since she&#x2019;d moved into her husband&#x2019;s home on the Bluff nearly eight years before, the dark roof outlined neatly against a sky that seemed dwarfed in comparison.<br><br> With her little boy tucked against her shoulder, Edith stepped gingerly through the garden gate at the side of the house by the driveway, looking for anything that might have fallen from the sky, wondering what she&#x2019;d do if she found something on fire. Wondering whether she&#x2019;d try to put it out with her son&#x2019;s blanket. Or throw it into the house and watch it burn.<br><br> She studied her flower garden, her only hobby that Calhoun approved of, smelling the tea olives and lemon trees that almost eradicated the odd smell of fumes that wafted toward her in waves. The full moon guided her along the white-stoned path, past her roses and butterfly bushes that nestled closer to the house and where she imagined whatever had fallen from the roof had landed.<br><br> Her foot kicked something hard and solid, reminding her that she was wearing only her house slippers. She started at the sight of a disembodied hand, its fist enclosing a rose. She pressed her hand against her chest to slow the heavy thud of her heart as she realized it was the arm from the marble statue of Saint Michael. He&#x2019;d watched over her since she&#x2019;d placed him there when she first realized she needed protection.<br> She spotted the rest of the statue lying faceup on the path among broken branches from the oak tree, his sightless eyes hollow in the moonlight. When she stepped forward to assess the damage, her foot collided with something hard and unyielding, hidden in the shadows beneath the fragrant boxwoods.<br><br> More sirens joined in the cacophony of sound that had invaded her quiet town, but as Edith knelt on the rocky path, she hardly seemed to notice, her attention completely focused on the brown leather suitcase that sat upright in her garden as if an uninvited visitor had suddenly come to call.<br><br> C.J. began to stir as Edith deliberated what she should do. Unwilling to separate herself from either her son or the suitcase, she pressed C.J. against her body with her left arm, ignoring the throbbing from the bruises that ran along her rib cage, then grabbed the handle of the suitcase. Gingerly she lifted it to test the weight, finding it lighter than it appeared. Walking slowly, she carried the suitcase up the back steps and into the empty kitchen.<br><br> After placing C.J. in the playpen, Edith returned to the brown suitcase, noticing for the first time the large dent in the bottom corner, the hinge badly damaged but not broken. Judging from the relatively good condition of the suitcase, she realized the canopy of oak limbs had broken its fall before it landed on the roof. A name tag dangled from the handle, practically begging her to touch it.<br><br> She should call the police. Let them know that she had a piece of whatever disaster had happened in the sky that night. Perhaps some survivor would be looking for this exact suitcase that now rested on her kitchen floor. Still, she hesitated. She wasn&#x2019;t sure why she felt the need for secrecy, but the thrill of the forbidden teased her senses, brought forth her rebellious spirit, which she&#x2019;d learned years before was best left hidden.<br><br> She pressed her lips together with determination. She&#x2019;d push the button on the latch to see whether it opened. It was probably locked anyway. Or the lock could be too damaged from the fall to open. Then she&#x2019;d call the police.<br><br> She heard a sound from the playpen and saw C.J. watching her with his wide blue eyes. &#x201c;Mama?&#x201d;<br><br> She smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, sweetheart. You go on back to sleep, all right?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Suitcase,&#x201d; he said around the ever-present thumb Calhoun had been demanding she make him stop sucking.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, darling. Now go on back to sleep.&#x201d;<br><br> He remained standing, watching her intently. She knew his rebellious streak came from her and she was reluctant to stifle it. &#x201c;You can watch for a little bit if you like. I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br> Edith kissed his damp forehead as she walked out of the kitchen and to the front door, which she carefully opened to peer out. She was more afraid of her husband&#x2019;s return than of the band of angry people she imagined marching toward her door to find the errant suitcase. The smells and sounds were stronger now, the sky glowing orange across the river over the fields of okra and watermelon as sirens screamed into the night.<br><br> Edith retreated into her house and closed the door, turning the key in the lock, then returned to the kitchen and the suitcase. After a quick glance at C.J., who remained sucking his thumb and watching everything with his father&#x2019;s eyes, she reached for the luggage tag and tried to read the name and address. Moisture must have seeped beneath the plastic cover and the cardboard name tag, making the ink run like tears. The address was nearly illegible, but she could read the name clearly: Henry P. Holden. When she flipped up the handle, she saw that a monogram had been boldly stamped in gold: HPH. She imagined a middle-aged man in a dark suit and hat, with a wife and kids at home, traveling on business. She thought of where they were now, and how they might be notified of the accident. Wondered whether it was possible to survive such a thing as falling from the sky.<br><br> She pushed the button and the latch popped open. It was a sign, Edith thought as her hands moved to the two latches on the sides of the suitcase. One opened easily, but the one on the side with the dent took a few twists and tugs.<br><br> Without pausing, she opened the suitcase wide on her kitchen table. She unlatched the separators on each side and folded them up, revealing neat stacks of starched and pressed dress shirts and suit pants, bleached white undershirts, boxers, and linen handkerchiefs. Everything had been packed so tightly that there&#x2019;d been little room for movement as the suitcase had tumbled to earth.<br><br> Edith recognized the scent of the detergent that wafted up to her as the same one she used, as if the clothes had come from her own washing machine. It had so obviously been packed by a woman that Edith almost laughed at the predictability of it, then sobered quickly as she pictured the faceless woman walking down a dark hallway to answer the ringing telephone.<br><br> She stared down again at the clothing, taking note of the quality of the thread count in the shirts, the soft linen handkerchiefs, the fine gabardine of Henry Holden&#x2019;s trousers, the thickness and brightness of the undershirts. Each handkerchief had a perfectly stitched monogram on the corner in bright, bold red: HPH. It all made sense for a man traveling on business. But as she stared at the suitcase&#x2019;s contents, something bothered her, something she couldn&#x2019;t quite put her finger on.<br><br> Calhoun had once told her it was her analytical mind that had first attracted him to her. As the only child of a widower police detective, she&#x2019;d never known any other way to be. So when the handsome lawyer Calhoun Heyward had come to her small town of Walterboro to try a case, she hadn&#x2019;t known that she would have been better off pretending to be a simpering female without opinions. Because in the end, that was what he&#x2019;d really wanted.<br><br> C.J. was sleeping standing up, his head cradled on the top rail of the playpen, his thumb in his mouth. Edith glanced nervously at the round metal clock over the sink. Calhoun could be home at any minute to find a locked front door and a man&#x2019;s suitcase on the kitchen table. She didn&#x2019;t stop to think where he&#x2019;d been or with whom, or if he&#x2019;d seen the airplane explode and had thought to worry about her and their son.<br><br> She quickly refastened the separators, the fasteners slipping through her fingers because she was going too fast and her hands shook. It was then that she realized what had been bothering her. The dopp kit. The ubiquitous men&#x2019;s toiletry kit was missing. No man traveled without one. She pulled the cloth separators back again, looking at the neatly packed clothes, studying the side where the clothes had shifted slightly more than on the other. She reached in to shove a stack back to the side, revealing a small pocket where a dopp kit would have fit during the packing. She pursed her lips, thinking. Could Mr. Holden have removed it before boarding his plane, believing he might have need of something inside it during the flight?<br><br> Edith smiled to herself. These were the questions her father had taught her to ask until her inquisitiveness had become a part of her. During the years of her miscarriages and Calhoun&#x2019;s growing disappointment in her, it had become her saving grace. It had been what had made her ignore the censure of her friends and husband and reach out to the local police department and offer her services as an artist with an unusual talent. It had kept her whole.<br><br> Forgetting the time and the sound of an approaching siren, she reached into the suitcase and carefully began to shift the clothing, searching for the missing dopp kit. She searched the top half of the case first, and then the bottom, almost giving up before her fingers brushed against something that didn&#x2019;t feel like cloth. Careful not to disturb anything further, she gently pushed away three pairs of neatly rolled-up dark socks to find a crisply folded letter.<br><br> She hesitated for only a moment before taking it out. It was expensive stationery, thick, heavy linen, the Crane watermark visible when Edith held it to the light. It wasn&#x2019;t sealed but had been tightly folded, as if the writer had pressed his or her fingers along the creases many times. When she flipped it over, a single word was written in thin black ink with elegant penmanship.<br> Beloved.<br> She paused, wondering how many boundaries she could cross, quickly deciding that she had already crossed too many to worry about one more. With steady hands she unfolded the letter and began to read the short lines written in the same elegant script as the word on the back.<br><br> She stared at the words for so long that they began to blur and dance off the page, until the letter fell to the floor as if the weight of the words were too much for Edith&#x2019;s fingers. She let it go, watching as it slipped beneath the new white refrigerator that had been delivered the previous week as an apology from Calhoun. She didn&#x2019;t try to retrieve it, wishing that the words could disappear from her memory just as easily.<br><br> She wasn&#x2019;t sure how long she stood there, staring at the small crack between the black and white vinyl floor tiles and the bottom of the new appliance, but she jumped when the hall phone began to ring. With a quick glance at the sleeping boy, she ran to answer it.<br><br> &#x201c;Edith? It&#x2019;s Betsy. I&#x2019;m so glad to hear your voice. We all ran to the river, but Sidney and I got worried when I saw that you and Calhoun weren&#x2019;t with us. Is everything all right?&#x201d;<br><br> Edith was surprised at the calmness to her voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Calhoun is working late, so I was here alone.&#x201d; It never surprised her how easily the lies spilled from her mouth anymore. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to leave the house because of C.J. He&#x2019;s been sick and was sound asleep. Didn&#x2019;t even wake up at the sound of the explosion.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It was an airplane,&#x201d; Betsy said, her voice higher pitched, a tone usually reserved for neighborhood gossip. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re saying it exploded&#x2014;just like that. Sidney said it was probably an engine catching on fire. You know how dangerous airplanes are. I took a train to visit my parents in Jackson last Christmas even though Sidney told me I should fly instead, so he can&#x2019;t tell me I was w...</p><h2>Symbol or Substance?: A Dialogue on the Eucharist with C. S. Lewis, Billy Graham and J. R. R. Tolkien</h2><p><p>In this engaging fictional conversation, Peter Kreeft gives credible voices to C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Billy Graham as they discuss one of the most contentious questions in the history of Christianity: Is Jesus symbolically or substantially present in the Eucharist?</p><p>These widely respected modern Christian witnesses represent three important Western theological traditions.

Also an Oxford don, Tolkien was a friend of Lewis, the author of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and a Roman Catholic.</p><p>While Lewis and Tolkien likely discussed the Eucharist during their long friendship, the conversation in this book never took place&#x2015;but it could have, says Kreeft, who faithfully presents the views of these three impressive men.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</b>, Professor of Philosophy at Boston College, is one of the most respected Christian authors of our time.

Mr. Creasy was wandering the pavement in his shirtsleeves.

I won&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can someone just disappear?&#x201d; I watched Mr. Creasy marching up and down the pavement. His shoulders were heavy and he studied his shoes as he walked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sometimes people get confused and need their own space.&#x201d; My mother spoke to the stove.<br> <br>&#x201c;Margaret Creasy was confused all right.&#x201d; My father turned to the sports section and snapped at the pages until they were straight. &#x201c;She asked far too many questions. You couldn&#x2019;t get away from her rabbiting on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She was just interested in people, Derek. You can feel lonely, even if you&#x2019;re married. And they had no children.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother looked over at me as though she were considering whether the last bit made any difference at all, and then she spooned porridge into a large bowl with purple hearts all around the rim.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you talking about Mrs. Creasy in the past tense?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Is she dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, of course not.&#x201d; My mother put the bowl on the floor. &#x201c;Remington,&#x201d; she shouted, &#x201c;Mummy&#x2019;s made your breakfast.&#x201d;<br> <br>Remington padded into the kitchen. He used to be a Labrador, but he&#x2019;d become so fat, it was difficult to tell.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll turn up,&#x201d; said my father.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d said the same thing about next door&#x2019;s cat. It disappeared years ago, and no one had seen it since.<br> <br>* * *<br><br>Tilly was waiting by the front gate, in a sweater which had been hand-washed and stretched to her knees. She&#x2019;d taken the bobbles out of her hair, but it stayed in the exact same position as if they were still there.<br> <br>&#x201c;The woman from number eight has been murdered,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>We walked in silence down the avenue, until we reached the main road. We were side by side, although Tilly had to take more steps to keep up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who lives at number eight?&#x201d; she said, as we waited for the traffic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Creasy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I whispered, in case Mr. Creasy had extended his search.<br> <br>&#x201c;I liked Mrs. Creasy. She was teaching me to knit. We did like her, Grace, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;very much.&#x201d;<br> <br>We crossed the road opposite the alley next to Woolworth&#x2019;s. It wasn&#x2019;t yet nine o&#x2019;clock, but the pavements were dusty hot, and I could feel the material of my shirt sticking to the bones in my back. People drove their cars with the windows down, and fragments of music littered the street. When Tilly stopped to change her school bag to the other shoulder, I stared into the shop window. It was filled with stainless-steel pans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who murdered her?&#x201d; A hundred Tillys spoke to me from the display.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one knows.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are the police?&#x201d;<br> <br>I watched Tilly speak through the saucepans. &#x201c;I expect they&#x2019;ll be along later,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re probably very busy.&#x201d;<br> <br>We climbed the cobbles in sandals which flapped on the stones. In winter ice, we clung to the rail and to each other, but now the alley stretched before us, a riverbed of crisp packets and thirsty weeds, and floury soil which dirtied our toes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you wearing a sweater?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Tilly always wore a sweater. Even in scorched heat, she would pull it over her fists and make gloves from the sleeves. Her face was handkerchief-white, and sweat had pulled slippery, brown curls onto her forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;My mother says I can&#x2019;t afford to catch anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When is she going to stop worrying?&#x201d; It made me angry, and I didn&#x2019;t know why, which made me even angrier, and my sandals became very loud.<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt she ever will,&#x201d; said Tilly. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s because there&#x2019;s only one of her. She has to do twice the worrying, to keep up with everyone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to happen again.&#x201d; I stopped and lifted the bag from her shoulder. &#x201c;You can take your sweater off now.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stared at me. It was difficult to read Tilly&#x2019;s thoughts. Her eyes hid behind thick, dark-rimmed glasses, and the rest of her gave very little away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said, and took off her glasses. She pulled the sweater over her head, and, when she appeared on the other side of the wool, her face was red and blotchy. She handed me the sweater, and I turned it the right way, like my mother did, and folded it over my arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;See,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s perfectly safe. Nothing will happen to you. I won&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sweater smelled of cough medicine and unfamiliar soap. I carried it all the way to school, where we dissolved into a spill of other children.<br> <br>* * *<br><br>I have known Tilly Albert for a fifth of my life.<br> <br>She arrived two summers ago in the back of a large, white van, and they unloaded her along with a sideboard and three easy chairs. I watched from Mrs. Morton&#x2019;s kitchen, while I ate a cheese scone and listened to a weather forecast for the Norfolk Broads. We didn&#x2019;t live on the Norfolk Broads, but Mrs. Morton had been there on holiday, and she liked to keep in touch.<br> <br>Mrs. Morton was minding me.<br> <br>Will you just sit with Grace while I have a little lie-down, my mother would say, although Mrs. Morton didn&#x2019;t sit very much at all, she dusted and baked and looked through windows instead. My mother spent most of 1974 having a little lie-down, and so I was minded by Mrs. Morton quite a lot.<br> <br>I stared at the white van. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that then?&#x201d; I said, through a mouthful of scone.<br> <br>Mrs. Morton pressed on the lace curtain, which hung halfway down the window on a piece of wire. It dipped in the middle, exhausted from all the pressing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be the new lot,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are the new lot?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; She dipped the lace down a little further. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t see a man, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I peered out. There were two men, but they wore overalls and were busy. The girl who had appeared from the back of the van continued to stand on the pavement. She was small and round and very pale, like a giant, white pebble, and was buttoned into a raincoat right up to her neck, even though we hadn&#x2019;t had rain for three weeks. She pulled a face, as though she were about to cry, then leaned forwards and was sick all over her shoes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Disgusting,&#x201d; I said, and took another scone.<br> <br>* * *<br><br>By four o&#x2019;clock, she was sitting next to me at the kitchen table.<br> <br>I had fetched her over because of the way she sat on the wall outside her house, looking as though she&#x2019;d been misplaced. Mrs. Morton got the dandelion and burdock out, and a new packet of Penguins. I didn&#x2019;t know then that Tilly didn&#x2019;t like eating in front of people, and she held on to the bar of chocolate until it leaked between her fingers.<br> <br>Mrs. Morton spat on a tissue and wiped Tilly&#x2019;s hands, even though there was a tap three feet away. Tilly bit her lip and looked out of the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you looking for?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;My mother.&#x201d; Tilly turned back and stared at Mrs. Morton, who was spitting again. &#x201c;I just wanted to check she&#x2019;s not watching.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not looking for your father?&#x201d; said Mrs. Morton, who was nothing if not an opportunist.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know where to look.&#x201d; Tilly wiped her hands very discreetly on her skirt. &#x201c;I think he lives in Bristol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bristol?&#x201d; Mrs. Morton put the tissue back into her cardigan sleeve. &#x201c;I have a cousin who lives in Bristol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, I think it might be Bournemouth,&#x201d; said Tilly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Mrs. Morton frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anyone who lives there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Tilly said, &#x201c;neither do I.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br><br>We spent our summer holiday at Mrs. Morton&#x2019;s kitchen table. After a while, Tilly became comfortable enough to eat with us. She would spoon mashed potato into her mouth very slowly, and steal peas as we squeezed them from their shells, sitting over sheets of newspaper on the living room carpet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want a Penguin or a Club?&#x201d; Mrs. Morton was always trying to force chocolate on to us. She had a tin-full in the pantry and no children of her own. The pantry was cavernous and heaved with custard creams and fingers of fudge, and I often had wild fantasies in which I would find myself trapped in there overnight and be forced to gorge myself to death on Angel Delight.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; Tilly said through a very small mouth, as if she were afraid that Mrs. Morton might sneak something in there when no one was looking. &#x201c;My mother said I shouldn&#x2019;t eat chocolate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She must eat something,&#x201d; Mrs. Morton said later, as we watched Tilly disappear behind her front door. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s like a little barrel.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br><br>Mrs. Creasy was still missing on Tuesday, and she was even more missing on Wednesday, when she&#x2019;d arranged to sell raffle tickets for the British Legion. By Thursday, her name was being passed over garden fences and threaded along the queues at shop counters.<br> <br>What about Margaret Creasy, then? someone would say. And it was like firing a starting pistol.<br> <br>My father spent his time stored away in an office on the other side of the town, and always had to have the day explained to him when he got home. Yet each evening, my mother asked if he had heard any news about Mrs. Creasy, and each evening he would sigh from the bottom of his lungs, shake his head, and go and sit with a bottle of pale ale and Kenneth Kendall.<br> <br>* * *<br><br>On Saturday morning, Tilly and I sat on the wall outside my house and swung our legs like pendulums against the bricks. We stared at the Creasys&#x2019; house. The front door was ajar, and all the windows were open, as if to make it easier for Mrs. Creasy to find her way back inside. Mr. Creasy was in his garage, pulling boxes from towers of cardboard, and examining their contents one by one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think he murdered her?&#x201d; said Tilly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I expect so,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I paused for a moment, before I allowed the latest bulletin to be released. &#x201c;She disappeared without taking any shoes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tilly&#x2019;s eyes bulged like a haddock. &#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The woman in the post office told my mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother doesn&#x2019;t like the woman in the post office.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She does now,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Mr. Creasy began on another box. With each one, he was becoming more chaotic, scattering the contents at his feet and whispering an uncertain dialogue to himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t look like a murderer,&#x201d; said Tilly.<br> <br>&#x201c;What does a murderer look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They usually have mustaches,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and are much fatter.&#x201d;<br> <br>The smell of hot tarmac pinched at my nose, and I shifted my legs against the warmth of the bricks. There was nowhere to escape the heat. It was there every day when we awoke, persistent and unbroken, and hanging in the air like an unfinished argument. It leaked people&#x2019;s days onto pavements and patios and, no longer able to contain ourselves within brick and cement, we melted into the outside, bringing our lives along with us. Meals, conversations, arguments were all woken and untethered and allowed outdoors. Even the avenue itself had changed. Giant fissures opened on yellowed lawns and paths felt soft and unsteady. Things which had been solid and reliable were now pliant and uncertain. Nothing felt sure anymore. The bonds which held things together were destroyed by the temperature&#x2014;this is what my father said&#x2014;but it felt more sinister than that. It felt as though the whole avenue was shifting and stretching, and trying to escape itself.<br> <br>A fat housefly danced a figure of eight around Tilly&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;My mum says Mrs. Creasy disappeared because of the heat.&#x201d; She brushed the fly away with the back of her hand. &#x201c;My mum says the heat makes people do strange things.&#x201d;<br> <br>I watched Mr. Creasy. He had run out of boxes, and was crouched on the floor of his garage, still and silent, and surrounded by debris from the past.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think it probably does,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;My mum says it needs to rain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s probably right.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at the sky, which sat like an ocean above our heads.<br> <br>It wouldn&#x2019;t rain for another fifty-six days.</p><h2>365 Thank Yous: The Year a Simple Act of Daily Gratitude Changed My Life</h2><p>One recent December, at age 53, John Kralik found his life at a terrible, frightening low: his small law firm was failing; he was struggling through a painful second divorce; he had grown distant from his two older children and was afraid he might lose contact with his young daughter; he was living in a tiny apartment where he froze in the winter and baked in the summer; he was 40 pounds overweight; his girlfriend had just broken up with him; and overall, his dearest life dreams--including hopes of upholding idealistic legal principles and of becoming a judge--seemed to have slipped beyond his reach. <br><br> Then, during a desperate walk in the hills on New Year's Day, John was struck by the belief that his life might become at least tolerable if, instead of focusing on what he didn't have, he could find some way to be grateful for what he had. <br><br> Inspired by a beautiful, simple note his ex-girlfriend had sent to thank him for his Christmas gift, John imagined that he might find a way to feel grateful by writing thank-you notes. To keep himself going, he set himself a goal--come what may--of writing 365 thank-you notes in the coming year.<br><br> One by one, day after day, he began to handwrite thank yous--for gifts or kindnesses he'd received from loved ones and coworkers, from past business associates and current foes, from college friends and doctors and store clerks and handymen and neighbors, and anyone, really, absolutely anyone, who'd done him a good turn, however large or small. Immediately after he'd sent his very first notes, significant and surprising benefits began to come John's way--from financial gain to true friendship, from weight loss to inner peace. While John wrote his notes, the economy collapsed, the bank across the street from his office failed, but thank-you note by thank-you note, John's whole life turned around. <br><br> <em>365 Thank Yous</em> is a rare memoir: its touching, immediately accessible message--and benefits--come to readers from the plainspoken storytelling of an ordinary man. Kralik sets a believable, doable example of how to live a miraculously good life. To read <em>365 Thank Yous</em> is to be changed.</p><p>John Kralik was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and attended the University of Michigan for college and law school.

I was playing with my favorite doll on the stone wall that bordered our driveway while he mowed the lawn. One minute he was mowing, and the next, he was facefirst in the grass as the mower propelled itself in slow motion down the hill of our backyard.<br> <br>I thought at first he was sleeping, or playing a game. But when I crouched beside him on the lawn, his eyes were still open. Damp cut grass stuck to his forehead.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t remember calling for my mother, but I must have.<br> <br>When I think about that day, it is in slow motion. The mower, walking alone. The carton of milk my mother was carrying when she ran outside, which dropped to the tarred driveway. The sound of round vowels as my mother screamed into the phone to give our address to the ambulance.<br> <br>My mother left me at the neighbor&#x2019;s house while she went to the hospital. The neighbor was an old woman whose couch smelled like pee. She offered me chocolate-covered peppermints that were so old the chocolate had turned white at the edges. When her telephone rang I wandered into the backyard and crawled behind a row of hedges. In the soft mulch, I buried my doll and walked away.<br> <br>My mother never noticed that it was gone&#x2014;but then, it barely seemed that she acknowledged my father being gone, either. She never cried. She stood stiff-backed through my father&#x2019;s funeral. She sat across from me at the kitchen table that I still sometimes set with a third place for my father, as we gradually ate our way through chipped beef casserole and mac-and-cheese-and-franks, sympathy platters from my father&#x2019;s colleagues and neighbors who hoped food could make up for the fact that they didn&#x2019;t know what to say. When a robust, healthy forty-two-year-old dies of a massive heart attack, the grieving family is suddenly contagious. Come too close, and you might catch our bad luck.<br> <br>Six months after my father died, my mother&#x2014;still stoic&#x2014;took his suits and shirts out of the closet they shared and brought them to Goodwill. She asked the liquor store for boxes, and she packed away the biography that he had been reading, which had been on the nightstand all this time; and his pipe, and his coin collection. She did not pack away his Abbott and Costello videos, although she always had told my father that she never really understood what made them funny.<br> <br>My mother carried these boxes to the attic, a place that seemed to trap cluster flies and heat. On her third trip up, she didn&#x2019;t come back. Instead, what floated downstairs was a silly, fizzy refrain piped through the speakers of an old record player. I could not understand all the words, but it had something to do with a witch doctor telling someone how to win the heart of a girl.<br> <br>Ooo eee ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang, I heard. It made a laugh bubble up in my chest, and since I hadn&#x2019;t laughed all that much lately, I hurried to the source.<br> <br>When I stepped into the attic, I found my mother weeping. &#x201c;This record,&#x201d; she said, playing it over again. &#x201c;It made him so happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew better than to ask why, then, she was sobbing. Instead, I curled up beside her and listened to the song that had finally given my mother permission to cry.<br> <br>Every life has a soundtrack.<br> <br>There is a tune that makes me think of the summer I spent rubbing baby oil on my stomach in pursuit of the perfect tan. There&#x2019;s another that reminds me of tagging along with my father on Sunday mornings to pick up the New York Times. There&#x2019;s the song that reminds me of using fake ID to get into a nightclub; and the one that brings back my cousin Isobel&#x2019;s sweet sixteen, where I played Seven Minutes in Heaven with a boy whose breath smelled like tomato soup.<br> <br>If you ask me, music is the language of memory.<br> <br>Wanda, the shift nurse at Shady Acres Assisted Living, hands me a visitor pass, although I&#x2019;ve been coming to the nursing home for the past year to work with various clients. &#x201c;How is he today?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;The usual,&#x201d; Wanda says. &#x201c;Swinging from the chandelier and entertaining the masses with a combination of tap dancing and shadow puppets.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grin. Mr. Docker is in the final throes of dementia. In the twelve months I&#x2019;ve been his music therapist, he&#x2019;s interacted with me twice. Most of the time, he sits in his bed or a wheelchair, staring through me, completely unresponsive.<br> <br>When I tell people I am a music therapist, they think it means I play guitar for people who are in the hospital&#x2014;that I&#x2019;m a performer. Actually, I&#x2019;m more like a physical therapist, except instead of using treadmills and grab bars as tools, I use music. When I tell people that, they usually dismiss my job as some New Age BS.<br> <br>In fact, it&#x2019;s very scientific. In brain scans, music lights up the medial prefrontal cortex and triggers a memory that starts playing in your mind. All of a sudden you can see a place, a person, an incident. The strongest responses to music&#x2014;the ones that elicit vivid memories&#x2014;cause the greatest activity on brain scans. It&#x2019;s for this reason that stroke patients can access lyrics before they remember language, why Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients can still remember songs from their youth.<br> <br>And why I haven&#x2019;t given up on Mr. Docker yet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for the warning,&#x201d; I tell Wanda, and I pick up my duffel, my guitar, and my djembe.<br> <br>&#x201c;Put those down,&#x201d; she insists. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to be carrying anything heavy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d better get rid of this,&#x201d; I say, touching my belly. In my twenty-eighth week, I&#x2019;m enormous&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m also completely lying. I worked way too hard to have this baby to feel like any part of the pregnancy is a burden. I give Wanda a wave and head down the hall to start today&#x2019;s session.<br> <br>Usually my nursing home clients meet in a group setting, but Mr. Docker is a special case. A former CEO of a Fortune 500 company, he now lives in this very chic elder-care facility, and his daughter Mim contracts my services for weekly sessions. He&#x2019;s just shy of eighty, has a lion&#x2019;s mane of white hair and gnarled hands that apparently used to play a mean jazz piano.<br> <br>The last time Mr. Docker gave any indication that he was aware I shared the same physical space as him was two months ago. I&#x2019;d been playing my guitar, and he smacked his fist against the handle of his wheelchair twice. I am not sure if he wanted to chime in for good measure or was trying to tell me to stop&#x2014;but he was in rhythm.<br> <br>I knock and open the door. &#x201c;Mr. Docker?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Zoe. Zoe Baxter. You feel like playing a little music?&#x201d;<br> <br>Someone on staff has moved him to an armchair, where he sits looking out the window. Or maybe just through it&#x2014;he&#x2019;s not focusing on anything. His hands are curled in his lap like lobster claws.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right!&#x201d; I say briskly, trying to maneuver myself around the bed and the television stand and the table with his untouched breakfast. &#x201c;What should we sing today?&#x201d; I wait a beat but am not really expecting an answer. &#x201c;&#x2018;You Are My Sunshine&#x2019;?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;&#x2018;Tennessee Waltz&#x2019;?&#x201d; I try to extract my guitar from its case in a small space beside the bed, which is not really big enough for my instrument and my pregnancy. Settling the guitar awkwardly on top of my belly, I start to strum a few chords. Then, on second thought, I put it down.<br> <br>I rummage through the duffel bag for a maraca&#x2014;I have all sorts of small instruments in there, for opportunities just like this. I gently wedge it into the curl of his hand. &#x201c;Just in case you want to join in.&#x201d; Then I start singing softly. &#x201c;Take me out to the ball game; take me out with the . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The end, I leave hanging. There&#x2019;s a need in all of us to finish a phrase we know, and so I&#x2019;m hoping to get him to mutter that final &#x201c;crowd.&#x201d; I glance at Mr. Docker, but the maraca remains clenched in his hand, silent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack; I don&#x2019;t care if I never get back.&#x201d;<br> <br>I keep singing as I step in front of him, strumming gently. &#x201c;Let me root, root, root for the home team; if they don&#x2019;t win it&#x2019;s a shame. For it&#x2019;s one, two, three&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly Mr. Docker&#x2019;s hand comes flying up and the maraca clips me in the mouth. I can taste blood. I&#x2019;m so surprised I stagger backward, and tears spring to my eyes. I press my sleeve to my cut lip, trying to keep him from seeing that he&#x2019;s hurt me. &#x201c;Did I do something to upset you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Docker doesn&#x2019;t respond.<br> <br>The maraca has landed on the pillow of his bed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to reach behind you, here, and get the instrument,&#x201d; I say carefully, and as I do, he takes another swing at me. This time I stumble, crashing into the table and overturning his breakfast tray.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is going on in here?&#x201d; Wanda cries, bursting through the door. She looks at me, at the mess on the floor, and then at Mr. Docker.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re okay,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wanda takes a long, pointed look at my belly. &#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod, and she backs out of the room. This time, I sit gingerly on the edge of the radiator in front of the window. &#x201c;Mr. Docker,&#x201d; I ask softly, &#x201c;what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>When he faces me, his eyes are bright with tears and lucidity. He lets his gaze roam the room&#x2014;from its institutional curtains to the emergency medical equipment in the cabinet behind the bed to the plastic pitcher of water on the nightstand. &#x201c;Everything,&#x201d; he says tightly.<br> <br>I think about this man, who once was written up in Money and Fortune. Who used to command thousands of employees and whose days were spent in a richly paneled corner office with a plush carpet and a leather swivel chair. For a moment, I want to apologize for taking out my guitar, for unlocking his blocked mind with music.<br> <br>Because there are some things we&#x2019;d rather forget.<br> <br>The doll that I buried at a neighbor&#x2019;s house on the day my father died was called Sweet Cindy. I had begged for her the previous Christmas, completely suckered by the television ads that ran on Saturday mornings between cartoons. Sweet Cindy could eat and drink and poop and tell you that she loved you. &#x201c;Can she fix a carburetor?&#x201d; my father had joked, when I showed him my Christmas list. &#x201c;Can she clean the bathroom?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had a history of treating dolls badly. I cut off my Barbie dolls&#x2019; hair with fingernail scissors. I decapitated Ken, although in my defense that had been an accident involving a fall from a bicycle basket. But Sweet Cindy I treated like my own baby. I tucked her each night into a crib that was set beside my own bed. I bathed her every day. I pushed her up and down the driveway in a stroller we&#x2019;d bought at a garage sale.<br> <br>On the day of my father&#x2019;s death, he&#x2019;d wanted to go for a bike ride. It was beautiful out; I had just gotten my training wheels removed. But I&#x2019;d told my father that I was playing with Cindy, and maybe we could go later. &#x201c;Sounds like a plan, Zo,&#x201d; he had said, and he&#x2019;d started to mow the back lawn, and of course there was no later.<br> <br>If I had never gotten Sweet Cindy for Christmas.<br> <br>If I&#x2019;d said yes to my father when he asked.<br> <br>If I&#x2019;d been watching him, instead of playing with the doll.<br> <br>There were a thousand permutations of behavior that, in my mind, could have saved my father&#x2019;s life&#x2014;and so, although it was too late, I told myself I&#x2019;d never wanted that stupid doll in the first place, that she was the reason my father wasn&#x2019;t here anymore.<br> <br>The first time it snowed after my father died, I had a dream that Sweet Cindy was sitting on my bed. Crows had pecked out her blue-marble eyes. She was shivering.<br> <br>The next day I took a garden spade from the garage and walked to the neighbor&#x2019;s house where I&#x2019;d buried her. I dug up the snow and the mulch from half of the hedgerow, but the doll was gone. Carried away by a dog, maybe, or a little girl who knew better.<br> <br>I know it&#x2019;s stupid for a forty-year-old woman to connect a foolish act of grief with four unsuccessful cycles of IVF, two miscarriages, and enough infertility issues to bring down a civilization&#x2014;but I cannot tell you how many times I&#x2019;ve wondered if this is some kind of karmic punishment.<br> <br>If I hadn&#x2019;t so recklessly abandoned the first baby I ever loved, would I have a real one by now?<br> <br>By the time my session with Mr. Docker ends, his daughter Mim has rushed from her ladies&#x2019; auxiliary meeting to Shady Acres. &#x201c;Are you sure you didn&#x2019;t get hurt?&#x201d; she says, looking me over for the hundredth time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I tell her, although I suspect her concern has more to do with a fear of being sued than with genuine concern for my well-being.<br> <br>She rummages in her purse and pulls out a fistful of cash. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; Mim says.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve already paid me for this month&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is a bonus,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure, with the baby and everything, there are expenses.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s hush money, I know that, but she&#x2019;s right. However, the expenses surrounding my baby have less to do with car seats and strollers than with Lupron and Follistim injections. After five IVF cycles&#x2014;both fresh and frozen&#x2014;we have depleted all of our savings and maxed out our credit cards. I take the money and tuck it into the pocket of my jeans. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I say, and then I meet her gaze. &#x201c;What your father did? I know you don&#x2019;t see it this way, but it&#x2019;s a huge step forward for him. He connected with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right on your jaw,&#x201d; Wanda mutters.<br> <br>&#x201c;He interacted,&#x201d; I correct. &#x201c;Maybe in a less than socially appropriate way . . . but still. For a minute, the music got to him. For a minute, he was here.&#x201d;<br> <br>I can tell Mim doesn&#x2019;t buy this, but that&#x2019;s all right. I have been bitten by an autistic child; I have sobbed beside a little girl dying of brain cancer; I have played in tune with the screams of a child who was burned over eighty percent of his body. This job . . . if it hurts me, I know I am doing it well.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better go,&#x201d; I say, picking up my guitar case.<br> <br>Wanda doesn&#x2019;t glance up from the chart she&#x2019;s writing in. &#x201c;See you next week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, you&#x2019;ll see me in about two hours at the baby shower.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What baby shower?&#x201d;<br> <br>I grin. &#x201c;The one I&#x2019;m not supposed to know about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wanda sighs. &#x201c;If your mother asks, you better make sure you tell her I wasn&#x2019;t the one who spilled the beans.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll act appropriately surprised.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mim reaches out her hand toward my protruding belly. &#x201c;May I?&#x201d; I nod. I know some pregnant women think it&#x2019;s an invasion of privacy to have strangers reaching to pat or touch or offer parenting advice, but I don&#x2019;t mind in the least. I can barely keep myself from rubbing my hands over the baby, from being magnetically drawn to the proof that this time, it is going to work.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a boy,&#x201d; she announces.<br> <br>I am thoroughly convinced that I&#x2019;m carrying a girl. I dream in pink. I wake up with fairy tales caught on my tongue. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always found it ironic that someone who has trouble getting pregnant begins in vitro fertilization by taking birth control pills. It is all about regulating an irregular cycle, in order to begin an endless alphabet soup of medications: three ampoules each of FSH and hMG&#x2014;Follistim and Repronex&#x2014;injected into me twice a day by Max, a man who used to faint at the sight of a needle and who now, ...</p><h2>Horse Diaries #9: Tennessee Rose</h2><p>Alabama, 1856.

It's true!&nbsp;&nbsp;Lose fat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop craving.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without counting fat grams and without giving up the foods you love. Includes recipes for healthy meals to lose weight.</b><br><br>Based on cutting-edge research, this revolutionary and deliciously satisfying plan has already helped thousands of patients lose weight and achieve other lifesaving health benefits, including lower cholesterol and blood pressure readings and an improvement or reversal of common disorders such as heart disease, adult-onset diabetes, and gout.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed by Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades, the simple regimen calls for a new way of eating: a protein-rich, moderate-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that will have you feeling better and more energetic within a week, and help correct blood sugar levels, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol within three weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you've been living the low-fat, no-fat way and still haven't lost weight, stop blaming yourself! Instead, turn to the breakthrough metabolic program that replaces lifelong dieting with lifelong health.</p><p>If smoked salmon and cream cheese omelets, saut�ed jumbo shrimp, and double-patty burgers suit your palate, belly up to the <i>Protein Power</i> diet: "Not a high protein diet" but "an adequate protein diet." Doctors Michael R. and Mary Dan Eades make a persuasive case in favor of "the diet we were meant to eat."<p> Similar to Dr. Robert Atkins's <i>New Diet Revolution</i>, the authors cite insulin as the main culprit in weight gain and expound the benefits of a diet extremely low in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, which are changed into sugar during digestion, stimulate the body to store fat, making weight loss virtually impossible. The most revolutionary idea put forth in <i>Protein Power</i> is that the fat you eat has very little bearing on the fat you gain: in other words, we aren't what we eat after all. Researchers have found that eating larger portions of protein in conjunction with severely reduced portions of carbohydrates causes people to burn the excess fat stored in their bodies.</p><p> <i>Protein Power</i> is packed with helpful charts and formulas, so you can estimate your body-fat percentage and your ideal weight for your particular body composition. There are worksheets to calculate your protein need and carbohydrate and protein equivalency charts, as well as charts that allow you to track your fat and weight loss. But this book is not all grams and percentages: it also shows you what a day of eating on this diet would look like and includes sample menus and 70 pages of recipes. If you've been starving yourself for years and just can't seem to lose weight, this may be the diet for you. <i>--Jhana Bach</i></p>An effective, medically sound diet that lets you eat bacon, eggs, steak, even cheese? <br>It's true!

He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>A few weeks before the launch of <i>Joy, Inc.,</i> I checked my Twitter feed at a conference I was attending, and there it was: <i>Inc</i>. magazine editor-at-large Leigh Buchanan&#x2019;s review of my book.</p><p>Leigh&#x2019;s article, titled &#x201c;The Most Joyful Company in America&#x2014;What Every Business Can Learn from the Brilliant Menlo Innovations,&#x201d; concluded with this thought: &#x201c;I wish the world were full of joyful companies. Personally, I&#x2019;d settle for decent ones. But joy is aspirational. Add it to the mission statement, by all means. Then sit down and have a good, hard think about what joy means for you.&#x201d;</p><p>Hers was the first big piece to be published about the book, and it was just the beginning. I was sure I felt like any playwright or director would after receiving the first professional review of their work. I wanted to jump up and shout with happiness to all the people around me, but all I could do was retweet the article and beam joyfully. Since then, <i>Fortune</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Fast Company</i>, and many other outlets have all weighed in on joy&#x2014;as did many readers.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been several months since the release of <i>Joy, Inc</i>., and my life has changed tremendously. Although the journey has sometimes been tiring, it has been a wonderful one. All our effort to make this book happen was worth it because I foresaw the incredible effect that the book would have on the Menlo team and our readers. Prior to the book&#x2019;s release I knew I had written the book I wanted to&#x2014;and I still liked reading it. I <i>knew</i> the press would be drawn to the message, I <i>knew</i> my speaking engagements would increase, and I <i>knew</i> tours of Menlo Innovations would increase in number and change in composition. I was certain that many new doors would open.</p><p>All of that has indeed happened, and I have some wonderful new stories to tell.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The most delightful surprise occurred within Menlo itself. I could see it in the team, hear it on our tours, and sense it in our client interactions. The Menlo team itself had changed. Many team members read the book and began to see Menlo in a different, more joyful light. Some team members, especially newer employees, commented that until they read <i>Joy, Inc.</i> they hadn&#x2019;t grasped the full depth of my story, my cofounder James Goebel&#x2019;s role in building the Menlo we know today, or the company&#x2019;s journey to joy. In short, this &#x201c;most joyful company&#x201d; became even more confident and serious about joy. We began holding each other and our company more accountable to the joy we hoped to produce in the world.</p><p>Potential clients and tour visitors could sense the renewed electricity of our team&#x2019;s energy. Our tours brought in senior and C-Level visitors from around the world, from companies including USAA Insurance, Steelcase, Bosch, QVC, Liberty Mutual, and McKinsey. Coca-Cola Enterprises was a particularly memorable tour; senior executives were so impressed by our joy that they bade a team member to come back to witness our Extreme Interview event and later attend our weeklong Deep Dive into Joy class. This kind of reaction to our workplace joy became commonplace. If there was ever any doubt on our part that joy would forever be our core message, this heartfelt response from our visitors sealed our conviction that we are on an important path for Menlo and the businesses that hope to adopt our message.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>At the close of the May 2014 Scrum Alliance Conference in New Orleans, a conference centered on &#x201c;joie de vivre&#x201d;&#x2014;joy of living&#x2014;I was asked to deliver the final keynote. My experiences at other conferences have taught me that being the closing speaker at an event is an honorable, yet dangerous position. You have the chance to leave a lasting effect on the attendees, but only if they stay to hear it. Each of the six hundred attendees would receive a copy of <i>Joy, Inc.</i>, but I knew my job would be more difficult than getting them to take the book home&#x2014;to create a lasting effect I needed them to read the book.</p><p>Soon I found out that word was spreading about my closing speech. It wasn&#x2019;t clear to me how this buzz had started, but whatever had triggered it the message being spread was: <i>Don&#x2019;t miss the closing keynote; you&#x2019;ll be sorry if you do.</i> By the time I gave my speech, the room was full and anticipation was high. As I concluded my talk, the audience leapt to its feet. My first standing ovation. This was the reaction I had hoped for. I gave them hope that change was possible. I gave them practical takeaways. I spoke to their deep desire to be a part of a team that works hard to put the message they believe in out into the world. It was a feeling like no other. I could feel tears welling. After things settled we proceeded to Q&amp;A, and afterward it happened again&#x2014;a second standing ovation. I have never experienced a more humbling moment, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be the last time. Joy was the message I was carrying, and the world was hungry for it.</p><p>The very next morning, I checked my Twitter feed and saw tweets from several attendees who had already read the entire book. They read it into the night, in the airport, and on their plane rides home. Check. I had achieved the desired effect.</p><p>Since the book was published, Intel, Disney, Walmart, Nike, PayPal, and eBay are just a few of the companies that have called me in to show them a better way of running their teams and improving their company approach. Perhaps the most thrilling call I received was from Virgin, where I was invited to spend a day with a small group exploring people-centered innovation in New York City with Sir Richard Branson. Life had indeed changed in ways I had hoped but could have never expected.</p><p>So what do I have to offer that companies like Disney, Nike, eBay, and Walmart don&#x2019;t already have? What so many businesses really want is joy and a way to get there. Many teams are operating in fear; they are working hard and they are tired. They want a job with meaning, a reason for all their hard work&#x2014;a reason that transcends pay, title, or authority. Our message shows businesses not only how to create happier and more successful employees, but also how to produce practical and improved business results.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>All of this new attention on Menlo is so exhilarating and inspiring that it would be easy to lose the real reason the book came to be: <i>You</i>, the reader. You might be a CEO, a CIO, or an executive trying to lead in a new, different, and compelling way. Equally likely, you are none of those&#x2014;rather, you are a dedicated, caring employee trying to bring joy into your work life in the same way I had struggled to do so in the earliest part of my career.</p><p>I have met you at conferences or interacted with you via e-mail, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Like many people, you may feel that you&#x2019;ve lost your shot at a happy career. The truth is, while you may have become disenchanted with your workplace, it isn&#x2019;t too late to work in a place you love. With the lessons laid out in this book, you have in your hand the guide to making the difference in your work life that you have always wanted.</p><p>The Menlo message has helped many employees out of low points in their careers. One young German named Christian wrote to tell me: &#x201c;You saved me.&#x201d; He went on to describe at great length his journey to career joy, then disillusionment. He shared a low point of his professional life:</p><p>&#x201c;I dropped everything, I was broken and my parents were worrying about me. I promised myself never, ever to work in a company again, because I realized the system is broken&#x2014;the system we all live in today. Well, tell someone that you won&#x2019;t work in a company because the system is broken, it gets you very strange responses; they all think you&#x2019;ve lost your mind.&#x201d;</p><p>But from the many employees I have encountered at low points in their careers, there are many who know that accepting an unhappy and broken workplace is not necessary. As Samina, an e-Commerce Release Manager, passionately wrote me from deep inside one of the world&#x2019;s largest and most successful organizations:</p><p>&#x201c;I do believe that we have an opportunity of a lifetime to make joy happen. As history has proved time and again, it only takes a handful of folks with sincerity, passion, strategy, and a ready-to-do-whatever-it-takes attitude to win a battle against a thousand-times-bigger crowd of passive and self-focused individuals.&#x201d;</p><p>I have seen and worked with many people who&#x2019;ve made positive changes to their difficult career situations since reading this book. Many changes were small at first, but every person who has taken steps to improve their workplace environment and satisfaction has reported joy from even the most gradual improvements they have made. Perhaps they tried paper planning, or a stand-up meeting, or they took down a wall or two and tried pairing a few times. They didn&#x2019;t have to quit their jobs or change their entire company. Often it started with the phrase, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try something new, let&#x2019;s run an experiment.&#x201d;</p><p>You have this same opportunity. There is no reason to give up on the idea of working in a workplace you love.</p><p>Finally, I want to thank you for picking up a copy of <i>Joy, Inc.</i> and allowing me into your life, even if for only a few hours. And thank you for the humbling opportunity to make a difference in your work and in your joy.</p><p>For me, this is the deepest joy of all.</p><p>RICH SHERIDAN</p><p>CEO, Chief Storyteller</p><p>Menlo Innovations</p><p>@menloprez</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rich Sheridan was close to writing the wrong book.</p><p>I stopped him dead in his tracks during the latest stages of his manuscript writing and implored him to change direction.</p><p>This wouldn&#x2019;t be a difficult change in what he&#x2019;d already written to that point, but it was profoundly important for what he was going to say to the world.</p><p>The book he thought he was writing was <i>Joy, Inc</i>. The book he was almost going to send to the world could have been called <i>Change, Inc.</i></p><p>Perhaps a good book, perhaps an important book, but not this book. Not the book I thought the world needed. Not the book I knew&#x2014;from personal experience and from seeing his firm&#x2014;that Rich was capable of writing. Not the book you all needed to read. Not the book that perhaps only Rich could write. In short, he was not about to write one of the most important business culture books of all time.</p><p>I told him it was time to take a stand.</p><p><i>For joy</i>.</p><p>Too many business books do the same thing. They equivocate, they hedge, they apologize. They let you, the reader, off the hook and in the process they take away your hope&#x2014;hope that things could be profoundly different than they are right now. This could have been that kind of business book. Quite frankly, I was going to do everything in my power to make sure that didn&#x2019;t happen. If I didn&#x2019;t, the world would be denied a very important message&#x2014;one it is desperate to hear and needs to hear. It&#x2019;s also a message that Rich Sheridan, through a combination of his wiring, experience, and passion, is uniquely qualified to give you.</p><p>You see, when you tantalize readers with the notion of joy, and then tell them how to get there, that&#x2019;s a big promise. Everyone promises to help you change your culture. We&#x2019;ve been writing about it for over three decades. I personally want to be Menlo. I want the joy. I told Rich, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you need to equivocate by suggesting that readers can pick the target they want.&#x201d; That message was unnecessarily tolerant. Crap&#x2014;anyone can pick money, performance, or whatever. But <i>joy</i>&#x2014;who&#x2019;s had the guts to promise that? To be honest, I&#x2019;m sick to death of writers who don&#x2019;t take a stance.</p><p>The TV shows I watched as a boy typically opened with the scene of a business-suited father coming home from work at the end of the day, carrying an expensive briefcase and whistling a happy tune. As the inconsequential sitcom plot unfolded, there were no references to Dad&#x2019;s actual work &#x201c;back at the office.&#x201d; No writer dared bring down the mood with sordid details about work. Consequently, the message of the fifties was as vague as it was odd. Work was a place that called for a suit and hat and required actions of a mysterious nature&#x2014;that left employees whistling show tunes at the end of the day.</p><p>My own father painted a very different picture of his workplace. We watched our TV from the other side of the tracks. The people in our neighborhood wore thick aprons and gloves at work to keep the gunk, slime, and glue off their clothes. You didn&#x2019;t see Dad or any of our neighbors sporting a fedora any more than you spotted one of them whistling as he came home from work. And most certainly the woman next door, who worked at the fish cannery, didn&#x2019;t skip her way into her doily-adorned living room. After work, she went straight to the kitchen, where she tried her best to wash the stench of fish from her hands.</p><p>Given the circumstances on our side of the tracks, people complained endlessly about the backbreaking and mind-numbing nature of their jobs along with the stupidity and pettiness of their bosses. They hated their jobs. It&#x2019;s what they talked about. It&#x2019;s what they told jokes about. It&#x2019;s what they wrote songs about. To paraphrase a line from <i>City Slickers</i>, if my dad&#x2019;s hate for his job had been people, he&#x2019;d have been China.</p><p>With this in mind, imagine my surprise some twenty years later when one day I found myself whistling as I walked out the door&#x2014;on the way to work, no less. I loved what I did. I wore neither suit nor fedora, but somehow I had found a way to extract joy from my job. What a shock.</p><p>At first I thought my satisfaction at work stemmed from the fact that I had a career rather than a job. Not true. A couple of years later, as the exhilaration of first creating a nifty product of my very own gave way to managing the unrelenting demands of customers and employees who were both interdependent and at each other&#x2019;s throats, I learned that it wasn&#x2019;t the side of the tracks you worked on that determined your satisfaction. It was something else&#x2014;something far more elusive. Working in a job you call a profession or in a building that&#x2019;s part of a &#x201c;campus&#x201d; or, for that matter, a mine chock-full of jewels doesn&#x2019;t necessarily lead to whistling as you skip along your path homeward. Joy doesn&#x2019;t spring from the nature of your product or service; it lies in the something else. But what?</p><p>Then I met Richard Sheridan.

Ray has a way of tackling seemingly overwhelming challenges with an army of reason, in the end convincing the reader that it is within our reach to create nonbiological intelligence that will soar past our own. This is a visionary work that is also accessible and entertaining.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Rafael Reif, president, MIT</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kurzweil&#x2019;s new book on the mind is magnificent, timely, and solidly argued!

The book describes the human brain as a machine that can understand hierarchical concepts ranging from the form of a chair to the nature of humor. His important insights emphasize the key role of learning both in the brain and in AI. He provides a credible road map for achieving the goal of super-human intelligence, which will be necessary to solve the grand challenges of humanity.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Raj Reddy, founding director, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; recipient of the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ray Kurzweil pioneered artificial intelligence systems that could read print in any type style, synthesize speech and music, and understand speech. These were the forerunners of the present revolution in machine learning that is creating intelligent computers that can beat humans in chess, win on <i>Jeopardy!</i>, and drive cars. His new book is a clear and compelling overview of the progress, especially in learning, that is enabling this revolution in the technologies of intelligence. It also offers important insights into a future in which we will begin solving what I believe is the greatest problem in science and technology today: the problem of how the brain works and of how it generates intelligence.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Tomaso Poggio, Eugene McDermott Professor, MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences; director, MIT Center for Biological and Computational Learning; former chair, MIT McGovern Institute for Brain Research; one of the most cited neuroscientists in the world</b><br><br> &#x201c;This book is a Rosetta stone for the mystery of human thought. Even more remarkably, it is a blueprint for creating artificial consciousness that is as persuasive and emotional as our own. Kurzweil deals with the subject of consciousness better than anyone from Blackmore to Dennett. His persuasive thought experiment is of Einstein quality: It forces recognition of the truth.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Martine Rothblatt, chairman and CEO, United Therapeutics; creator of Sirius XM Satellite Radio</b><br><br> &#x201c;Kurzweil&#x2019;s book is a shining example of his prodigious ability to synthesize ideas from disparate domains and explain them to readers in simple, elegant language. Just as Chanute&#x2019;s <i>Progress in Flying Machines</i> ushered in the era of aviation over a century ago, this book is the harbinger of the coming revolution in artificial intelligence that will fulfill Kurzweil's own prophecies about it.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Dileep George, AI scientist; pioneer of hierarchical models of the neocortex; cofounder of Numenta and Vicarious Systems</b><br><br> &#x201c;Ray Kurzweil&#x2019;s understanding of the brain and artificial intelligence will dramatically impact every aspect of our lives, every industry on Earth, and how we think about our future.

In addition, he is the author of several&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling novels in the continuation of Robert B. Parker&#x2019;s Spenser series. Before turning to fiction, he was a correspondent for the<i>&nbsp;St. Petersburg Times</i>, a crime reporter for the<i>&nbsp;Tampa Tribune</i>, and, in college, played defensive end for the undefeated Auburn University football team (for which he was featured on the cover of&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>). He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.1<br><br> Quinn headed home, south on the Mississippi highway, in a truck he&#x2019;d bought in Phenix City, Alabama, for fifteen hundred, a U.S. Army rucksack beside him stuffed with enough clothes for the week and a sweet Colt .44 Anaconda he&#x2019;d won in a poker game. He carried good rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and classic country, and photos from his last deployment in Afghanistan, pics of him with his Ranger platoon, the camp monkey &#x201c;Streak&#x201d; on his shoulder, Black Hawks at sundown over the mountains. Things you bring back home after six years away, from 3rd Battalion Headquarters at Fort Benning to Iraq to Afghanistan and back again, when you didn&#x2019;t really intend to return home so fast, if at all. He drove south on Highway 7 and then down 9W, and kept heading south into the winding hill country that had been logged down to nothing decades ago, leaving the people scrub pines and junk trees and squashed beer cans and bottles. This part of the state had always seemed used up to him as a kid, and it looked just as used up in the headlight glow of the truck. He was headed back down to Jericho at midnight, not wanting to see a damn soul till the funeral tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He figured nobody plans being away for that long, but when you join up at eighteen and earn your tab just before September 11th, a soldier can keep pretty damn busy. He tried to recall the last time he&#x2019;d seen his mother (not caring if he ever saw his father again), and wondered about his sister who hadn&#x2019;t called him in two Christmases. At home there was an ex-girlfriend who&#x2019;d dumped him not long after basic and good friends he hadn&#x2019;t spoken to in years. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He turned up the radio, a Johnny Cash version of a classic Western ballad. Quinn knew the song by heart but loved hearing it every time. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The old truck ran at seventy on a steady ribbon of blacktop unfolding from hill to hill, a path cut through endless forest that once had been traveled by horse and wagon, Tibbehah County being one of the most remote counties in North Mississippi. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After years of marching and maneuvers, sitting still seemed odd to him, although at rest he could fall asleep at will and wake up just as fast. The Regiment had whittled him down to a wiry, muscular frame built for speed, surprise, chaos, and violence. His hair was cut in the standard high and tight, not even an inch thick on top and shaved on the sides, making his face seem even more chiseled in the rearview mirror, sharp angles thanks to a Choctaw grandmother about a hundred years back mixed with the hard Scotch-Irish who settled the South. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The truck&#x2019;s heater was cranked, and Quinn, his hand on the wheel, sat comfortably in a black T?shirt, blue jeans, and cowboy boots. In the ashtray he kept a half of a dead cigar that he&#x2019;d smoked about a hundred miles back with some bad coffee. The trip was only five hours, but it was a hell of a long time alone with your thoughts. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Another bend, another curve on the highway, and there was a speck in the light. He touched the brakes&#x2014;finding them a lot less tight than the salesman had promised&#x2014;thinking the speck was a spooked deer or a dog but then seeing it was the bare back of a woman, turning on long spindly legs and caught in his high beams. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He shanked the steering wheel to the right, the truck coming within an arm&#x2019;s reach of the hair rushing across her blank face. He was in a ditch and stuck, back wheels spinning into mud. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quinn got out and tromped over to the girl, still standing there on the double yellow line, her breath audible against the quiet of the motor and hot ticking of the engine. There were cows calling from someplace across a barbed-wire fence, and a train whistled far off. A lonesome midnight moon glowed, and Quinn called to the girl, just spotting a logging truck cresting the hill. He grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the shoulder, finding her face in his truck&#x2019;s headlight. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She nodded. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;What the hell you doing in the middle of the road?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see you.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hear my truck?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t say anything. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Shit, I about killed you.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The girl wore cowboy boots, a miniskirt, and a sequined halter top busting at the stomach. The girl, maybe eighteen or nineteen or sixteen, was blond and light-eyed. She had tight curly hair, a small upturned nose, and was well on her way with child. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You from here?&#x201d; he asked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She shook her head, breath clouding in the cold. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d give you a ride, but&#x2014;&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She said it didn&#x2019;t matter and turned away, and kept walking south. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quinn hopped back in the truck and cranked the ignition, the F-150 older than him kicking to life, and he knocked it in four-wheel drive just for the hell of it, thinking he&#x2019;d never get out of that ravine. But the tires spun, and it lurched forward a foot and then five feet, and he was back on the road, following the girl. He let down his side window, slowly, and told her to get in. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She stopped and didn&#x2019;t say a word. She just stood there, back roads leading nowhere all around, with nothing on her, nothing to her, and then she climbed inside the cab. Quinn accelerated fast in case she decided to change her mind. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Headed down to Tibbehah County,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Jericho.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t realize he&#x2019;d left the radio on, catching a staticky local station. A talk-radio-show host offering his views at the decline of American morals and the nearing of the End Times. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; he asked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; she asked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Twenty-nine.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You look a lot older.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quinn and the girl didn&#x2019;t speak for nearly fifteen miles. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You can let me out here,&#x201d; she said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Nothing here.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I can walk.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Where you from?&#x201d; Quinn asked, keeping the same speed. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Alabama.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You walked from Alabama?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fur piece,&#x201d; she said, staring straight ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c; &#x2019;Specially in those boots.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You from Jericho?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Grew up there.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You know a man named Jody?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t been home in some time,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his last name?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The girl didn&#x2019;t say anything. She just stared out at the headlights hitting the ten feet of darkness ahead of them, not much to see along the road but trailers perched on some cleared land and homemade signs offering fresh vegetables, although the season had passed months ago. The nights had turned chilly; past cotton harvesttime. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;What you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; is dangerous,&#x201d; Quinn said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Thanks for your concern.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Just tryin&#x2019; to help.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Why are you going back?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;How long you been gone?&#x201d; she asked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Six years and a few months.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You do something bad?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Why would you ask that?&#x201d; Quinn asked, a little edge in his voice. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Just trying to talk.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You have money?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You can let me off in town.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You have people?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Jody,&#x201d; the girl said, not sounding too excited about the prospect. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;The boy without a last name.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She stayed silent and leaned her head against the window glass, a few stray cars passing, high beams dimming over the crests of hills, all the way till they reached the Tibbehah County line, the road sign spray-painted over with the words AIN&#x2019;T NO HOPE. Quinn recognized some things, Varner&#x2019;s Quick Mart, the small high school stadium where he&#x2019;d played football long after they&#x2019;d been state champs in &#x2019;78, JT&#x2019;s Garage&#x2014;but JT&#x2019;s looked like it&#x2019;d shut down a while back. The downtown movie theater where he&#x2019;d seen Fievel Goes West with his kid sister had been turned into a church. He passed the town cemetery where he&#x2019;d probably be buried alongside both sets of grandparents and a few kin beyond that, and then they were circling the town Square. A small gazebo stood in the center as a monument to all the boys who&#x2019;d been killed in action since the Civil War. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Is this all there is?&#x201d; the girl asked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Pretty much,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Can I get you a place to stay?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make my own way, thank you.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Some churches and places might could help. Hey, look, there&#x2019;s a motel right across the railroad tracks over there. I&#x2019;ll pay for your room tonight and then you can make your way fresh in the morning. I have to check in, too.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I know that song,&#x201d; she said, turning to look at his face. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not shy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I draw the line at pregnant teens.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t say anything. He gunned the motor and crossed over the tracks, circling down into the Traveler&#x2019;s Rest, an old U-shaped motel where the units faced outward to the highway. Quinn remembered it used to be thirty bucks a night back when the couples needed to be alone at prom time. Now they advertised bass fishing in their pond and free Wi-Fi. You used to could drive past this place at midnight and know which girls had finally given in to their boyfriends or who was stepping out. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quinn grabbed his bag, paid for the rooms, and tossed the girl her key. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; he said, heading to his room. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you back in the morning.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Not necessary,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I got a funeral to be at anyway.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Who died?&#x201d; she asked.<br> The funeral started at nine a.m. sharp, everyone noting that his uncle sure would have appreciated the punctuality. There were about twenty people there. Quinn expected more, but understood it was a cold, rainy morning, and it being Thanksgiving Day and all. Most were men, old veterans who&#x2019;d been buddies with his uncle since Korea, long before he&#x2019;d become sheriff back in &#x2019;73. They held their baseball hats, decorated for whatever military branch they&#x2019;d entered, over their tired hearts as the body of Hampton Beckett was lowered into the ground to the sounds of a twenty-one-gun salute, some of the old men looking like they sure enjoyed getting out the rifles and firing off a few rounds. Every damn snap made Quinn recoil a bit, and he hated himself for that, watching the flag being folded and handed to a frizzled waitress from the Fillin&#x2019; Station diner, a woman that Hamp had been seeing since his wife had died five years ago. There were nice words and handshakes, and then it started to rain harder and everyone ducked under their umbrellas and ran for their cars, snaking out of the county cemetery and starting the real bit of the ceremony at the VFW club. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As Quinn reached for the truck&#x2019;s door, Luke Stevens waded through a ditch to shake his hand. He hadn&#x2019;t spoken to Luke since they graduated from high school, but he looked pretty much the same, with shaggy brown hair, a handsome face, and confident grin. His gold glasses were spotted with rain and his suit drenched. He just gave a brief smile to Quinn, shook his hand, and then wrapped him in an awkward hug. Luke still feeling bad about taking Anna Lee away, even though Quinn was the one who&#x2019;d left. Luke being the one who&#x2019;d gone to medical school at Tulane and come back to Jericho to live and die. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quinn started to speak, but Luke had turned back to his car, where Quinn caught only the back of Anna Lee&#x2019;s black dress as she climbed inside and shut the door. Hell, he didn&#x2019;t know what to say anyway.<br> The VFW building wasn&#x2019;t much but cinder block and tin, murals of Europe, Vietnam, and Iraq painted on the walls. A sign outside advertised BINGO SATURDAYS, and a CATFISH FRY from two Sundays back. Quinn removed his damp dress coat and loosened his wet tie and sat at a table with three old men. One of them looked around the empty room, more for show than from worry, and pulled out a bottle of Wild Turkey; another headed to the kitchen to fetch some coffee mugs. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You been to see your mother yet?&#x201d; asked old Mr. Jim, a Third Army man who from his barbershop pulpit told stories of meeting Patton, even keeping the prayer card he&#x2019;d been issued since before they rolled into Belgium. His nose resembled a rutabaga, his eyes narrow and a washed-out blue. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll want to see you.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be angry.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;He was her brother,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t seem too much to show up at his funeral.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;They hadn&#x2019;t spoken for some time,&#x201d; Mr. Jim said. &#x201c;Bad words said.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Those two argued over the color of the sky,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Hamp didn&#x2019;t talk to her for nearly a month after she called John Wayne a pussy.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Old Judge Blanton, small and white-haired in a black suit, cracked open the seal on the bourbon and uncorked the bottle. Luther Varner, a Marine in Vietnam, owner of Varner&#x2019;s Quick Mart, returned with four mismatched cups. Varner lit a long, cheap cigarette. Quinn wished he&#x2019;d brought in cigars. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He felt odd sitting with them, the men always just a &#x201c;Sir&#x201d; and a polite handshake. Quinn was never part of the boys sitting around drinking coffee in the morning at Varner&#x2019;s. But here he was after doing what was expected of him in the Army, and the old boys seemed to say, &#x201c;Sit down, and sit a spell. You&#x2019;re one of us now.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t wear your uniform,&#x201d; Judge Blanton said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worn it enough.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You gettin&#x2019; redeployed?&#x201d; Mr. Jim asked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;We just got back,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Third Batt did six months in Afghanistan.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You see much action?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;We always do.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all boys get called in when the shit hits the fan,&#x201d; Varner said. &#x201c;In case of trouble, break the glass and call in the Rangers.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know why he did it,&#x201d; Mr. Jim said, making a clicking sound with his cheek. He was staring into a blank spot in the corner of the VFW, not listening much to what was going on around him. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quinn watched. The other men exchanged glances. All looked down at the table. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a good twenty seconds of silence when all Quinn could hear was breathing and rain pinging on the roof. He sat and waited. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Mr. Jim said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Know what?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Jim looked to Varner and Varner to old Judge Blanton, Quinn noting Blanton must&#x2019;ve been elected their spokesperson. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Judge Blanton took a big swig of whiskey. &#x201c;Sorry, Quinn. Ole Hamp stuck a .44 in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Go figure.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Devil Colony: A Sigma Force Novel (Sigma Force Novels, 6)</h2><p><b>About James Rollins</b><br><br>JAMES ROLLINS is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of international thrillers that have been translated into more than forty languages. Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b>The Critics Rave</b><br><br>The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b>The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br>As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b>Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br>The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.In recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing "seminars." James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.<br><br>James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)</p><p><strong>Product Description</strong> <br>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author James Rollins comes a novel of boundless imagination and meticulous research, a book that dares to answer a frightening question at the heart of America: <em>Could the founding of the United States be based on a fundamental lie? </em>The shocking truth lies hidden within the ruins of an impossibility, a lost colony of the Americas vanished in time and cursed into oblivion. A place known only as <em>The Devil Colony</em>. <p></p> Deep in the Rocky Mountains, a gruesome discovery&#x2014;hundreds of mummified bodies&#x2014;stirs international attention and fervent controversy. Despite doubts about the bodies' origins, the local Native American Heritage Commission lays claim to the prehistoric remains, along with the strange artifacts found in the same cavern: gold plates inscribed with an unfathomable script. <p></p> During a riot at the dig site, an anthropologist dies horribly, burned to ashes in a fiery explosion in plain view of television cameras. All evidence points to a radical group of Native Americans, including one agitator, a teenage firebrand who escapes with a vital clue to the murder and calls on the one person who might help&#x2014;her uncle, Painter Crowe, Director of Sigma Force. <p></p> To protect his niece and uncover the truth, Painter will ignite a war among the nation's most powerful intelligence agencies. Yet an even greater threat looms as events in the Rocky Mountains have set in motion a frightening chain reaction, a geological meltdown that threatens the entire western half of the U.S. <p></p> From the volcanic peaks of Iceland to the blistering deserts of the American Southwest, from the gold vaults of Fort Knox to the bubbling geysers of Yellowstone, Painter Crowe joins forces with Commander Gray Pierce to penetrate the shadowy heart of a dark cabal, one that has been manipulating American history since the founding of the thirteen colonies. <p></p> But can Painter discover the truth&#x2014;one that could topple governments&#x2014;before it destroys all he holds dear? <p></p> <strong> A Q&amp;A with Author James Rollins </strong><br><strong> </strong> <p></p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong>Q:</strong> There are some pretty fantastic settings in <em>The Devil Colony</em>, all pretty much right here in the good ol&#x2019; US of A. Was it nice to be able to set a book mainly in America? Were you able to visit the stunning locations in the book, such as the Arizona desert and the Rocky Mountains?</p> <p><strong>Rollins:</strong> I had great fun researching this novel set in my own backyard (so to speak). For the past decade, I&#x2019;ve been fielding questions from readers about setting a Sigma novel within the United States. But I knew it had to be the perfect story, a novel thrilling enough to justify coming home. I&#x2019;ve been searching for that story for about five years, and when I finally discovered it, the book still took me a full two years to write. It&#x2019;s one of the biggest and most shocking of my novels. It took me trekking across the country and back, from Washington, D.C. and Fort Knox out east, to Salt Lake City and Yellowstone National Park out west. I interviewed Mormon scholars, read scientific and historical abstract, and studied ancient petroglyphs. It is a story never told&#x2014;but one that needs to be finally revealed after two hundred years of secrets.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;while he never appears in this story&#x2014;plays a significant role. Why Thomas Jefferson? What intrigues you about him?</p> <p><strong> Rollins: </strong>Everyone knows Thomas Jefferson as the architect of the Declaration of Independence. Volumes have been written about the man over the past two centuries, but of all the founding fathers of America, he remains to this day wrapped in mystery and contradictions. He was both politician and scientist.</p> For instance, it was only in 2007 that a coded letter, buried in his papers, was finally cracked and deciphered. It was sent to Jefferson in 1801 by a colleague who shared a passion for secret codes. Jefferson was fascinated to the point of fixation on Native American culture and history. At his home in Monticello, he put together a collection of tribal artifacts that was said to rival museums of the day (a collection that mysteriously disappeared after his death). Many of these Indian relics were sent to him by Lewis and Clark during their famed expedition across America. But what many don&#x2019;t know is that Jefferson sent a secret message to Congress in 1803 concerning Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s expedition. It revealed the true hidden purpose behind the journey across the West. In <em>The Devil Colony</em>, you&#x2019;ll learn that purpose&#x2014;and so much more about the founding of America. And it has nothing to do with freemasons, Knights Templar, or crackpot theories. The truth is as illuminating as it is disturbing. <p></p> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>Your books often include high-concept scientific theory. While not wanting to spill any secrets about the plot of <em>The Devil Colony</em>, what are some of the breaking-news scientific concepts laced through the pages of this book?</p> <strong><strong>Rollins:</strong> </strong>The science in this novel addresses the next big leap in scientific research and industry. It can be summarized in one word: Nanotechnology. In a nutshell, it means manufacturing at the atomic level, at a level of one billionth of a meter. The nanotech industry is exploding. It is estimated that this year alone $70 billion worth of nanotech products will be sold in the U.S. alone: toothpaste, sunscreen, cake icing, teething rings, running socks, cosmetics, and medicines. <p></p> What&#x2019;s the downside of such a growth industry? These nanoparticles can cause illness, even death. It&#x2019;s a new and wild frontier. There is presently no requirement for the labeling of nano-goods, no required safety studies of products containing nanoparticles. But there&#x2019;s an even darker side to this industry. This technology has a history that goes back further than the twentieth century&#x2014;much further. <em>The Devil Colony</em> explores those dark roots of this &#x201c;new&#x201d; science. <p></p> <p></p> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong></strong> As a reader, it&#x2019;s a huge treat to re-connect with the Sigma Force team, all of whom are such beloved characters. As an author, is it a similar experience for you to write about them? Do you feel like you&#x2019;re visiting with dear friends?</p> <p><strong><strong>Rollins:</strong> </strong>Definitely. I&#x2019;ve been living and breathing these characters for going on a decade. We&#x2019;ve seen them grow, have children, face the challenge of balancing work with family, and deal with losses. While the Sigma team is chocked full of talented and dedicated people, they are still people with real-life challenges alongside the world-spanning adventures. In this book especially, those two worlds collide in a harrowing manner for one of my characters. To me, that&#x2019;s what makes these characters feel so alive in my heart. They are not a static team who run into adventure after adventure. Instead, they change, they mature, they get life-altering injuries&#x2014;and yes, they also die. It&#x2019;s that fragility, that mortality, that breathes life into a character.</p><b>ADVANCE PRAISE FOR THE DEVIL COLONY</b><br><br> "Terrible secrets, the sweep of history, an epic canvas, breathless action...nobody--and I mean nobody--does this stuff better than Rollins." -- Lee Child on The Devil Colony<br><br> "From the hidden Indian treasure, to the Fort Knox secrets, to the conspiracy at the beginning of the United States The Devil Colony gives you every reason why you'll want to be a member of Sigma Force." -- Brad Meltzer, New York Times bestselling author of The Inner Circle on The Devil Colony<br><br> <b> PRAISE FOR JAMES ROLLINS AND THE SIGMA FORCE NOVELS</b><br><br> "Rollins does his job: thrills promised, then delivered" -- Tampa Tribune<br><br> "James Rollins is a master of international action intrigue" -- Richmond Times-Dispatch<br><br> "Rollins combines real-world science with high-octane action to create rousing stories of adventure that are as exciting as any movie" -- Chicago Sun-times<br><br> "This guy doesn't write novels-he builds roller coasters...Rollins excels at combining action and history with larger-than-life characters...A must for pure action fans." -- Booklist<br><br> "Rollins effortlessly blends science and superstition in the grand tradition of Clive Cussler and David Morrell." -- Providence Journal</p><h2>The 5: 2 Fast Diet for Beginners: The Complete Book for Intermittent Fasting with Easy Recipes and Weight Loss</h2><p>The 5 2 Diet is a proven way to lose weight easily.

Her daughter saved by a lie.</i><br>Salem, 1752. Sarah Carrier Chapman, weak with infirmity, writes a letter to her granddaughter that reveals the secret she has closely guarded for six decades: how she survived the Salem Witch Trials when her mother did not.</b><br><br>Sarah's story begins more than a year before the trials, when she and her family arrive in a New England community already gripped by superstition and fear. As they witness neighbor pitted against neighbor, friend against friend, the hysteria escalates--until more than two hundred men, women, and children have been swept into prison. Among them is Sarah's mother, Martha Carrier. In an attempt to protect her children, Martha asks Sarah to commit an act of heresy--a lie that will most surely condemn Martha even as it will save her daughter.<br><br>This is the story of Martha's courageous defiance and ultimate death, as told by the daughter who survived.<br></p><p>Kathleen Kent lives in Dallas with her husband and son. THE HERETIC&#39;S DAUGHTER is her first novel.Mare Winningham starts by expressing young Sarah Carrier&#39;s dislike for her harsh mother and stern father. Then a pox comes to their late-seventeenth-century farm near Salem, Massachusetts, and Sarah is removed to the lively home of her aunt. Winningham lets us hear the tenderness in Sarah&#39;s voice as she warms to cheerier surroundings. Winningham&#39;s portrayal of Sarah&#39;s hostility on homecoming is sharpened with preadolescent indignation and judgment. Gradually, Winningham&#39;s tones change as Sarah becomes bitter and protective when her mother is accused of witchcraft. Powerful descriptions of 9-year-old Sarah&#39;s time in prison are depicted well by the fear, anger, and repulsion Winningham projects into her reading. Author Kent, a tenth-generation descendent of Martha Carrier, who was hanged as a witch in 1692, has an accurate vision for time and place, equaled by Winningham&#39;s narration. S.W.

The student of Scripture as well as of religion will learn much from the clear and beautiful presentation of details that cannot be easily visualized when reading Scripture passages. This book also clearly lays out the relation between the few remains of the Temple with reference to the original buildings. This is an absolute must for the modern student and visitor to Jerusalem.</em></p> --Dr. Emanuel Tov, J.L.

Seif</p><h2>Champagne for the Soul: Rediscovering God&#39;s Gift of Joy</h2><p>&#34;The injunction &#39;Get real&#39; usually means &#39;Leave your world of fantasy and return to what really is.&#39; True Realism always and everywhere is to find out where joy resides. In the past year this magical gift got lost or mislaid in my life. Mike Mason has located it, given it voice, and helped me to recover it. Even one sip of Champagne for the Soul is a heady, exhilarating experience.&#34; -Brennan Manning, author of A Glimpse of Jesus: The Stranger to Self-Hatred If you were given the chance to be happy for the rest of your life, wouldn&#39;t you jump at it? In Champagne for the Soul, bestselling author Mike Mason explains that the Bible does make this offer. Yet most of us hang back, reluctant and skeptical. Theologically most Christians will agree that the Bible teaches and offers a life of joy; yet deep down we&#39;re not convinced that such a life is practical-for us or any ordinary person. But, says Mason, such joy truly is ours to claim and embrace. What you now hold in your hands is a call to throw off all worries and complaints and to &#34;come and share your master&#39;s happiness&#34; (Matthew 25:21). Is it possible to live every day in joy? You will never know if you don&#39;t try. These pages, drawn from the author&#39;s own ninety-day experiment in actively pursuing joy, will lead you on a journey that will help you-no matter what your circumstances-to escape the trap of worry, fear, and dullness and grab hold of the joy of the Lord. Mike Mason is the best-selling author of several books, including The Mystery of Marriage, The Mystery of Children, The Gospel According to Job, and Practicing the Presence of People. He and his wife, Karen, an M.D. in general practice, live in Langely, British Columbia, Canada, with their teenage daughter, Heather.</p><p><b>Mike Mason</b> is the best-selling author of several books including <i>The Mystery of Marriage, The Mystery of Children, The Gospel According to Job</i>, and <i>Practicing the Presence of People</i>. He and his wife, Karen, an M.D. in general practice, live in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, with their teenage daughter, Heather. A full-time author for twenty years, Mike is currently working on a children&#x2019;s novel.By his own admission, Mason (The Mystery of Children) isn't a happy person by nature. A recovering alcoholic who had lived most of his life in a state of anxious, borderline depression, Mason realized that a lingering, low-grade melancholy was his last line of defense against the love of God. In this 90-day experiment, he sets out to see if he can "break my addiction to the cheap wine of melancholy... [and] seek champagne for the soul." His 90 short essays, each prefaced by a verse from Scripture about joy, chronicle his quest to find the happiness buried in the ordinary world of laundry to be done, errands to be run, meetings to attend and the general muck and mire of the human condition. Over the course of his experiment Mason discovers simple truths about joy: to find it you must discover a solid sense of identity, face crippling fears, offer thanks when you don't feel like it and try something new. Metaphors abound, and his passion is infectious as he helps demystify joy for the reader. At the end of his experiment, Mason finds that the deepest joys come out of the blue for no discernible reason, because "God Himself is all goodness and all rightness and because the depths of His joy surpass all understanding." Christians of all denominations will be inspired to sample this foamy elixir, sipping from its wisdom slowly and finding fresh ways to discover joy in everyday circumstances. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>No More Faking Fine: Ending the Pretending</h2><p><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever been given empty clich�s during challenging times, you know how painful it can feel to be misunderstood by well-meaning people. Far too often, it seems the response we get to our hurt and disappointment is to suck it up, or pray it away.&nbsp;</p><p>But Scripture reveals a God who meets us where we are, not where we pretend to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>No More Faking Fine</em> is your invitation to get gut-level honest with God through the life-giving language of lament. Lament, a practice woven throughout Scripture, is a prayer that God never ignores, never silences, and never wastes. As author Esther Fleece says, &#x201c;Lament is the unexpected pathway to true intimacy with God, and with those around us.&#x201d;</p><p>Esther learned this the hard way, by believing she could shut down painful emotions that haunted her from a broken past she tried to forget on her fast track to success. But in silencing her pain, she robbed herself of the opportunity to be healed. Maybe you&#x2019;ve done the same.&nbsp;</p><p><em>No More Faking Fine</em> is your permission to lament&#x2014;to give voice to the hurt, frustration, and disappointment you&#x2019;ve kept inside and silenced for too long. Drawing from careful biblical study and hard-won insight, Esther reveals how to use God&#x2019;s own language to draw closer to Him as He leads us through any darkness into His marvelous light.</p></p><p><p><strong>Esther Fleece Allen loves to connect people around the world to practical, faith-centered tools for living through every season, good and bad.

Esther Fleece introduces the language of lament and argues persuasively that this is a prayer God never ignores. No More Faking Fine is a book for anyone wrestling with the unavoidable tension created when the faithful suffer. (<i>Andy Stanley, communicator, author, and pastor</i>)<br><br>For many of us, when someone asks how we&#x2019;re doing, our automatic response is &#x201c;fine&#x201d;---even when we aren&#x2019;t. Esther Fleece transparently shares her story of &#x201c;faking fine&#x201d; until she couldn&#x2019;t anymore---and how God has brought emotional healing as she learned to stop pretending. This is an encouraging and helpful book. (<i>Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family</i>)<br><br>No More Faking Fine deepened and solidified my understanding of bringing God into every part of my life, especially when it comes to difficulties and grief. I know this will help heal, challenge, and encourage people wherever they are in life. This is such a needed book for our time! (<i>Rachel Cruze, #1 New York Times bestselling author and personal finance expert</i>)<br><br>In a culture full of facades, Esther Fleece unpacks the vital and overlooked role of honest lament in our complete healing from life&#x2019;s harshest storms. No More Faking Fine leads us on a biblical yet scarcely traveled road, where God meets us in the midst of our deepest pain, in ways unlike any we could possibly experience in our greatest victories. (<i>Benjamin Watson, National Football League tight end and author</i>)<br><br>Esther Fleece exposes her personal pain to us in this book. She exposes what that pain did to distort her reality and shift her from truly trusting that God is near. Her pain forced her to the Scriptures, and the Scriptures exposed a way through the pain. This book is a gift to be led through the Word in this way---to be encouraged to give voice to our destructive thoughts and memories, to receive permission to let it all out to God. There is no judgment of our hurt or our painful experiences. All are worthy to be heard by God. Thank you, Esther, for sharing your story and teaching us to be free to lament. (<i>Sarah and Matthew Hasselbeck, ESPN analyst and retired NFL quarterback</i>)<br><br>Many days, it just feels easier to fake being fine. Esther Fleece&#x2019;s powerful voice for lament, beautifully told through her splintered story, allures me into authenticity before God. She invites us to this ancient, yet out-of-fashion way and introduces another side of God to those of us who are hungry for more than those pat answers to what aches within our insides. (<i>Sara Hagerty, author of Every Bitter Thing Is Sweet</i>)<br><br>Esther Fleece&#x2019;s powerful story encourages us to be honest to God and to each other. Life isn&#x2019;t easy in a world under the curse, nor does God intend it to be. The poison of prosperity theology has set up countless Christians for disillusionment because they&#x2019;ve been told they&#x2019;re supposed to always be healthy, wealthy, successful, popular, and &#x201c;just fine.&#x201d; As Esther demonstrates, we need the authenticity of David and the prophets and Paul and, above all, Jesus, recognizing that God will be with us when our hearts are broken. He can infuse us with joy even when we are suffering. One day, God&#x2019;s children will &#x201c;live happily ever after.&#x201d; Until that day comes, let&#x2019;s give ourselves and each other permission to grieve and feel pain, loss, and discouragement. In other words, let&#x2019;s quit faking fine so we can gladly embrace together the comfort of Jesus. (<i>Randy Alcorn, founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries and author of Heaven and Happiness</i>)<br><br>Esther Fleece writes an authentic and vulnerable book that we all need to read. Esther helps us to recover the language and practice of lament. This is for anyone who has been disappointed in life but is determined to overcome and live honestly and sincerely. (<i>Brady Boyd, pastor of New Life Church, Colorado Springs, and author of Speak Life and Addicted to Busy</i>)<br><br>I have walked with Jesus my entire adult life and never read anything so powerful calling us to lament. Esther Fleece is the real deal. Her life is a genuine lament of brokenness and celebration of God&#x2019;s redemption. (<i>Dr. Juli Slattery, president of Authentic Intimacy</i>)<br><br>Esther Fleece is a gift to the church. No More Faking Fine is just the book many Christians need to understand the biblical call to lament. The only way out of the valley of sorrow is through the path of lament. Let Fleece be your guide on the journey to joy.

K. Chesterton, Francis Schaeffer, and C. S. Lewis. But with new challenges comes the need for a fresh apologetic that specifically addresses the arguments levied against faith in our time of scientific atheism and skepticism.<br><br>In the spirit of C. S. Lewis's <i>Mere Christianity</i>, Alister McGrath's <i>Mere Apologetics</i> seeks to equip readers to engage gracefully and intelligently with the challenges facing the faith today while drawing appropriately on the wisdom of the past. Rather than supplying the fine detail of every apologetic issue in order to win arguments, <i>Mere Apologetics</i> teaches a method that appeals not only to the mind but also to the heart and the imagination. This highly accessible, easy-to-read book is perfect for pastors, teachers, students, and lay people who want to speak clearly and lovingly to the issues that confront people of faith today.</p><p><b>How to engage unbelievers with intelligence and imagination<br></b><br>Throughout history there have been great and articulate defenders of the faith. But with the new challenges of scientific atheism we see in our day, there is a need for a fresh and flexible approach to apologetics. Rather than supplying the fine detail of every apologetic issue in order to win arguments, <i>Mere Apologetics</i> teaches a method that appeals not only to the mind but also to the heart and the imagination.<br><br>After discussing the biblical basis for and historical uses of apologetics, McGrath offers various approaches to sharing your faith with others. He outlines pointers to faith, such as our innate sense of longing for justice, our appreciation for beauty, the order we see in the physical world, and much more. He also shows how there are many right ways to share your faith--through explanations, arguments, stories, and images--and helps you decide which works best for your personality and your audience.<br><br>"Apologetics is not to be seen as a defensive and hostile reaction against the world," says McGrath, "but as a welcome opportunity to exhibit, celebrate, and display the treasure chest of the Christian faith." If you long to commend your faith to those outside the church, <i>Mere Apologetics</i> will show you how to do so gracefully and effectively.<br>"This is a fresh, clear, and practical introduction to apologetics from someone who doesn't just talk about the subject but actually does it brilliantly. It is especially helpful because it avoids the fruitless wrangling between apologetic schools that stops many people from getting on with the task. "--Os Guinness, author of <i>Long Journey Home<br></i><br>"<i>Mere Apologetics</i> helps readers work out their own way to effectively communicate and defend the gospel. An excellent text for courses in apologetics. A great read for both beginning and experienced apologists."--Jim Sire, author of <i>The Universe Next Door<br></i><br>"Over the years I have found Alister McGrath to be an insightful, wise guide on many topics. So I am pleased to recommend his book on apologetics. It is foundational, practical, and creative as well as faithful to Scripture.

It includes generous selections from the three poetic alter egos that the Portuguese writer dubbed &#34;heteronyms&#34; - Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis and Alvaro de Campos - and from the vast and varied work he wrote under his own name.</p><p>Fernando Pessoa was born in Lisbon in 1888 and was brought up in Durban, South Africa. In 1905 he returned to Lisbon where he matriculated at the University, and continued to read and write in English. He published in 1918 35 Sonnets and in 1922 the three parts of his English Poems, all composed many years before. The rest of his life passed uneventfully in Lisbon. The only book published in his lifetime was Mensagem, a collection of poems on patriotic themes which won a consolation prize in a national competition. Pessoa also wrote under three pseudonyms, Alberto Caeiro, Alvaro de Campos and Ricardo Reis, whose biographies he invented. Richard Zenith lives in Lisbon, where he works as a freelance writer, translator, and critic. His translations include Galician-Portuguese troubadour poetry, novels by Antonio Lobo Antunes, Pessoa&#39;s The Book of Disquiet, and Fernando Pessoa and Co - Selected Poems, which won the 1999 American PEN Award for Poetry in Translation.*Starred Review* Eight years ago, <i>Fernando Pessoa &amp; Co.</i>, a 300-page volume of Richard Zenith's translations of Portugal's great modernist poet, was one of the events of the year in poetry. Fortunately, Pessoa (1888-1935) was so prolific that only four short poems reappear in Zenith's new 100-pages-longer selection. To further prove himself no slouch, Zenith has written a new introductory essay for this book, explaining again Pessoa's partition of his poetry-writing consciousness into four distinct personae: Alberto Caeiro, a pastoral poet who died young; Caeiro's disparate disciples, stoic, classical Ricardo Reis and ebullient bisexual engineer and Whitman apostle, Alvaro de Campos; and the nostalgic "Fernando Pessoa--himself," as Zenith denominates the persona that bears Pessoa's name. There were additional "heteronyms," as Pessoa called his noms de plume, including some that wrote poems in English (which Pessoa learned as a boy in South Africa) and the bookkeeper who penned the prose work, <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>; Pessoa created biographies for them all. All four of Pessoa's principal Portuguese poet-personalities are obsessed with time, which apparently flows but is physically apprehensible only as an elusive point. Each wrote quite differently from the others, and as Zenith renders them, all wrote brilliantly. Particularly entertaining in this book are de Campos' lengthy odes, which are both moving tributes to and hilarious parodies of Whitman. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

That&#x2019;s the critical question facing Odd Thomas, the young man with a unique ability to commune with restless spirits and help them find justice and peace. But this time, it&#x2019;s the <i>living</i> who desperately need Odd on their side. Three helpless innocents will be brutally executed unless Odd can intervene in time.

I was lying on my back in bed, utterly motionless, yet the bell rang three times again. The vibrations that shivered through my bare chest seemed much too strong to have been produced by such a tiny clapper. A third set of three rings followed, and then only silence. I waited and wondered until dawn crept down the sky and across the bedroom windows.<br><br>Later that morning in early March, when I walked downtown to buy blue jeans and a few pairs of socks, I met a guy who had a .45 pistol and a desire to commit a few murders. From that encounter, the day grew uglier as surely as the sun moved from east to west.<br><br>My name is Odd Thomas. I have accepted my oddness. And I am no longer surprised that I am drawn to trouble as reliably as iron to a magnet.<br><br>Nineteen months ago, when I was twenty, I should have been riddled with bullets in that big-�news shopping-�mall shoot-�out in Pico Mundo, a desert town in California. They say that I saved a lot of people in my hometown. Yet many died. I didn&#x2019;t. I have to live with that.<br><br>Stormy Llewellyn, the girl I loved more than life itself, was one of those who died that day. I saved others, but I couldn&#x2019;t save her. I have to live with that, too. Living is the price I pay for failing her, a high price that must be paid every morning that I wake.<br><br>In the nineteen months since that day of death, I have traveled in search of the meaning of my life. I learn by going where I have to go.<br><br>Currently I rented a quaint, furnished three-�bedroom cottage in a quiet coastal town a couple of hundred miles from Pico Mundo. The front porch faced the sea, and yellow bougainvillea cascaded across half the roof.<br><br>Annamaria, whom I had known only since late January, occupied one of the bedrooms. She appeared to be ready to give birth in about a month, but she claimed that she had been pregnant for a long time and insisted that she would be pregnant longer still.<br><br>Although she said many things that I failed to understand, I believed that she always spoke the truth. She was mysterious but not deceptive.<br><br>We were friends, never paramours. A lover who is enigmatic will most likely prove to be a cataclysm waiting to happen. But a charming friend whose usual warmth is raveled through with moments of cool inscrutability can be an intriguing companion.<br><br>The morning when I set out on a shopping expedition, Annamaria followed me as far as the porch. She said, &#x201c;Daylight savings time doesn&#x2019;t start for another five days.&#x201d;<br><br>At the bottom of the steps, I turned to look at her. She wasn&#x2019;t a beauty, but she wasn&#x2019;t plain, either. Her clear pale skin appeared to be as smooth as soap, and her large dark eyes, which reflected the sparkling sea, seemed as deep as galaxies. In sneakers, gray-�khaki pants, and a baggy sweater, she was so petite that she might have been a child dressed in her father&#x2019;s clothes.<br><br>Not sure why she had mentioned daylight savings time, I said, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be long. I&#x2019;ll be back hours before sunset.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Darkness doesn&#x2019;t fall to a predictable schedule. Darkness can overwhelm you any time of the day, as you know too well.&#x201d;<br><br>She once told me that there are people who want to kill her. Although she had said no more and had not identified her would-�be murderers, I believed that she was as truthful about this as about all other things.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay here if you&#x2019;re in danger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one in danger, young man. Here or there, anywhere, you&#x2019;re the one perpetually on the cliff&#x2019;s edge.&#x201d;<br><br>She was eighteen, and I was nearly twenty-�two, but when she called me young man, it always felt right. She possessed an air of timelessness, as if she might have lived in any century of recorded history, or in all of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Do what you must,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but come back to us.&#x201d;<br><br>Do what you must sounded ominously significant, not the language one might use to send a friend off to buy socks.<br><br>From behind Annamaria and beyond a window, Tim watched solemnly. Crowding close to him on the left and right, paws on the windowsill, gazing out at me, were our two dogs, a golden retriever named Raphael and a white German shepherd named Boo. Only nine years old, Tim had been with us for over one month, after we rescued him from an estate called Roseland, in the sleepy town of Montecito. I&#x2019;ve written about that ordeal in a previous volume of these memoirs. We were his only family now. Because of his unique history, we would soon need to fabricate an identity into which he could grow in the years to come.<br><br>My life is as odd as my name.<br><br>Tim waved at me. I waved at Tim.<br><br>Just before stepping out of the house, I had asked the boy if he wanted to accompany me. But with a benign smile, Annamaria had said that neither Xerxes nor Leonidas had invited small children to accompany them to Thermopylae.<br><br>In 480 b.c., three hundred Spartans under the command of Leonidas had for a while held at bay two hundred thousand Persians under Xerxes in the battle of Thermopylae, before being slaughtered. I failed to see the similarity between my modest shopping expedition and one of the fiercest military engagements in history.<br><br>Even though it is always fruitless to seek an explanation from Annamaria when she makes such baffling statements, I considered asking for amplification. But she had opened the door for me, had waved me out of the kitchen, followed me onto the porch, and stood smiling at me as I looked back at her from the bottom of the steps. The moment to press her for elucidation seemed to have passed.<br><br>Annamaria&#x2019;s smile is so comforting that, in its radiance, you can almost believe that this world offers nothing more threatening than what you&#x2019;d find in Pooh Corner&#x2014;�in spite of her references to the slaughter of the Spartans.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;The bell rang last night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t think she could have heard it from her room, through two closed doors.<br><br>Previously she had told me that if the bell rang in the night, we would soon thereafter move on to a new place.<br><br>She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you again when the wind blows the water white and black,&#x201d; and she turned away, retreating into the cottage.<br><br>Beyond the beach, the sea spread blue to the horizon. The day remained still and mild, and the sky was so clear that it seemed I should be able to discern the stars in spite of the sunshine that concealed them.<br><br>Not mystified but certainly bewildered, I walked north half a mile to the heart of the village, with a wariness that I hadn&#x2019;t felt minutes earlier. Shaded by ancient California live oaks, the downtown shopping area was a three-�lane street flanked by just six blocks of stores, restaurants, and quaint inns. If you wanted a real town, you had to go up the coast to Santa Barbara.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know that a guy would soon offer to neuter me or that he would be carrying a pistol fitted with a sound suppressor. I have a psychic gift that occasionally includes a prophetic dream, but when awake, I do not see moments of the future.<br><br>When I first noticed the truck that pricked my curiosity, I did not realize that a formidable enemy was behind the steering wheel. I didn&#x2019;t even get a glimpse of the driver.<br><br>My unrelenting curiosity has gotten me in big trouble. It has also saved my butt a lot of times. On balance, it&#x2019;s a plus. And it isn&#x2019;t true that curiosity killed the cat. Usually, cats are done in by coyotes or Peterbilts.<br><br>Anyway, my curiosity is part of my gift, my sixth sense. I am compelled to indulge it.<br><br>The truck was an eighteen-�wheel ProStar+. The cool-�looking, aerodynamic tractor with the massive grille and lizard-�eye headlights was painted red and black with sparkly silver striping. The black trailer bore no corporate logo or advertising.<br><br>As I reached the shopping district, the eighteen-�wheeler cruised past me, into the heart of the village, heading north. Without realizing what I was doing, I picked up my pace to a racewalk. When the ProStar+ braked at a stop sign, I almost caught up with it.<br><br>As the behemoth accelerated across the intersection, I began to run, which was when I realized that I knew intuitively something about the truck must be evil.<br><br>Well, not the ProStar+ itself. I&#x2019;m not one who believes that a vehicle can be possessed by a demonic spirit and, driverless, speed around town to run down people for the thrill of tasting blood with its tires, any more than I believe that Herbie, the Volkswagen in that series of Disney movies, had a mind of its own with a desire to bring lovers together and to thwart villains. If you believe the former, you have to believe the latter, and the next thing you know, you&#x2019;ll be taking your Ford, with its sexy GPS voice, to the car wash just to see her naked and soapy.<br><br>I fell rapidly behind the truck, but then, near the northern end of the village, it turned left off the street, toward a supermarket. If the driver had been making a delivery, he would have gone behind the building to the loading dock. Instead, he pulled to a stop across several parking spaces at the end of the lot nearest to the street.<br><br>By the time I reached the eighteen-�wheeler, where it stood in the trembling shade of a row of breeze-�stirred eucalyptuses, it was unattended. Catching my breath, I walked slowly around the vehicle, looking it over.<br><br>My intuition bristled like the hackles on a dog. Heightened intuition is part of my sixth sense.<br><br>The day was mild, the breeze mellow, but the area immediately around the truck was colder than could be explained by eucalyptus shade alone. When I put the palm of one hand against the sidewall of the trailer, it felt as though the driver had pulled off the road to wait out a blinding snow squall at high elevation.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t what truckers called a reefer, which hauled frozen food. No refrigeration unit was mounted on the front wall of the trailer, behind the tractor.</p><h2>The Story of the Snow Children: Mini edition</h2><p><p>Poppy is gazing out of the window at the snow when suddenly she sees that the snowflakes are really Snow Children, dancing and whirling in the garden.

From her childhood in rural England and initial forays into British theater, to her first massive successes on Broadway and in the West End--notably as Eliza Doolittle in <i>My Fair Lady</i>--<i>Home</i> puts her celebrated career in context. While arguably offering more detail about the Andrews family than necessary, it nevertheless dishes wonderful anecdotes about legends and Andrews contemporaries like No�l Coward, Rex Harrison, Robert Goulet, Richard Burton, and Rodgers and Hammerstein, in prose as crisp and immaculate as the author herself. It also offers a revealing look into the intricate, exhaustive craft of performing--skills often taken for granted in tabloid times.

Jung Foundation Books Series)</h2><p>Fairy tales seem to be innocent stories, yet they contain profound lessons for those who would dive deep into their waters of meaning. In this book, Marie-Louise von Franz uncovers some of the important lessons concealed in tales from around the world, drawing on the wealth of her knowledge of folklore, her experience as a psychoanalyst and a collaborator with Jung, and her great personal wisdom. Among the many topics discussed in relation to the dark side of life and human psychology, both individual and collective, are: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; How different aspects of the "shadow"&#x2014;all the affects and attitudes that are unconscious to the ego personality&#x2014;are personified in the giants and monsters, ghosts, and demons, evil kings and wicked witches of fairy tales <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; How problems of the shadow manifest differently in men and women <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; What fairy tales say about the kinds of behavior and attitudes that invite evil <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; How Jung's technique of Active imagination can be used to overcome overwhelming negative emotions <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; How ghost stories and superstitions reflect the psychology of grieving <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; What fairy tales advise us about whether to struggle against evil or turn the other cheek<br>Dr. von Franz concludes that ever rule of behavior that we can learn from the unconscious through fairy tales and dreams is usually a paradox: sometimes there must be a physical struggle against evil and sometimes a contest of wits, sometimes a display of strength or magic and sometimes a retreat. Above all, she shows the importance of relying on the central, authentic core of our being&#x2014;the innermost Self, which is beyond the struggle between the opposites of good and evil.</p><p>Marie-Louise von Franz (1915&#x2013;1998) was the foremost student of C. G. Jung, with whom she worked closely from 1934 until his death in 1961. A founder of the C. G. Jung Institute of Zurich, she published widely on subjects including alchemy, dreams, fairy tales, personality types, and psychotherapy.</p><h2>The Betrayal (Fear Street Saga Trilogy, No. 1)</h2><p>Nora knows the secrets behind the horrifying things happening on Fear Street and reveals the dark legacy that marked the start of the terror three hundred years earlier, when a young girl was burned at the stake.

Now Lynch brings back his outrageous hero for a caper so death-defying, nothing short of a miracle will pull it off.<br><b><br></b>After a brutal battle with the underworld that nearly destroyed him, Locke and his trusted sidekick, Jean, fled the island city of their birth and landed on the exotic shores of Tal Verrar to nurse their wounds. But even at this westernmost edge of civilization, they can&#x2019;t rest for long&#x2014;and are soon back to what they do best: stealing from the undeserving rich and pocketing the proceeds for themselves. <br><br>This time, however, they have targeted the grandest prize of all: the Sinspire, the most exclusive and heavily guarded gambling house in the world. Its nine floors attract the wealthiest clientele&#x2014;and to rise to the top, one must impress with good credit, amusing behavior...and excruciatingly impeccable play. For there is one cardinal rule, enforced by Requin, the house&#x2019;s cold-blooded master: it is death to cheat at any game at the Sinspire. <br><br>Brazenly undeterred, Locke and Jean have orchestrated an elaborate plan to lie, trick, and swindle their way up the nine floors...straight to Requin&#x2019;s teeming vault. Under the cloak of false identities, they meticulously make their climb&#x2014;until they are closer to the spoils than ever. <br><br>But someone in Tal Verrar has uncovered the duo&#x2019;s secret. Someone from their past who has every intention of making the impudent criminals pay for their sins. Now it will take every ounce of cunning to save their mercenary souls. And even that may not be enough....</p><p>Locke Lamora, the erstwhile Thorn of Camorr, and Jean Tannen have fled their home city and the wreckage of their lives. But they can&#39;t run forever, and after escaping Camorr they decide to head for the richest and most difficult target on the horizon-- the city-state of Tal Verrar. And the Sinspire.The Sinspire is the ultimate gambling house . . . exclusive, luxurious, and fiendishly guarded. No thief has ever survived an attempt to rob it. Naturally, Locke plans to take it for a fortune, in his biggest gamble yet. But this perfect crime may have to wait.Someone else in Tal Verrar wants the Gentlemen Bastards&#39; expertise, and they&#39;re not gentle in compelling Locke and Jean to devote their talents to an even more unlikely and suicidal proposition-- masquerading as pirates on the high seas. Fine work for a pair of landlubbing thieves barely able to tell one end of a ship from the other! Locke and Jean find their abiding friendship tested to its very limits in this strange new world of lurching wooden decks, brutal ship-to-ship action, and feuding pirate captains. But not even their sojourn as buccaneers can keep the Gentlemen Bastards from their much-desired reckoning with all the powers that have conspired to interrupt their lives, including the last people in the world any sane person would want to offend... the Bondsmagi of Karthain.Red Seas Under Red Skies will be illustrated with a full color cover, and four full page illustrations (one exclusive to the lettered) by Edward MillerScott Lynch was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1978 and currently lives in Wisconsin with his wife and a small menagerie of household critters.

Stephen King lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.</p><h2>Daughter of the Forest (The Sevenwaters Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p><br>Juliet Marillier is a rare talent, a writer who can imbue her characters and her story with such warmth, such heart, that no reader can come away from her work untouched. <i>Daughter of the Forest</i> is a testimony to that talent, a first novel and the beginning of a trilogy like no other: a mixture of history and fantasy, myth and magic, legend and love.<br><br>Lord Colum of Sevenwaters is blessed with six sons: Liam, a natural leader; Diarmid, with his passion for adventure; twins Cormack and Conor, each with a different calling; rebellious Finbar, grown old before his time by his gift of the Sight; and the young, compassionate Padriac.<br><br>But it is Sorcha, the seventh child and only daughter, who alone is destined to defend her family and protect her land from the Britons and the clan known as Northwoods. For her father has been bewitched, and her brothers bound by a spell that only Sorcha can lift.<br><br>To reclaim the lives of her brothers, Sorcha leaves the only safe place she has ever known, and embarks on a journey filled with pain, loss, and terror.<br><br>When she is kidnapped by enemy forces and taken to a foreign land, it seems that there will be no way for her to break the spell that condemns all that she loves. But magic knows no boundaries, and Sorcha will have to choose between the life she has always known and a love that comes only once.<br><br>.<br><br></p><p>At the heart of this surprisingly accomplished first novel, first book of the Sevenwaters trilogy, is a retelling of an ancient Celtic legend. Marillier's story, however, is much more than a slightly disguised fairy tale. Young Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Irish Lord Colum of Sevenwaters, a domain well protected from invading Saxons and Britons by dense forest where, legend says, fey Deirdre, the Lady of the Forest, walks the woodland paths at night. Colum is first and foremost a warrior, bent on maintaining his lands against all outsiders. Not all of his sons are so bound to the old ways, and that family friction leads to outright disobedience when Sorcha and her brother Finbar help a Briton captive escape from Colum's dungeon. Soon after, Colum brings home a new wife who ensorcels everyone she can't otherwise manipulate. By her spell Sorcha's brothers are cursed to become swans. Only Sorcha, hiding deep in the forest, can break the spell by painfully weaving shirts of starwort nettle--but then Sorcha is captured by Britons and taken away across the sea. Determined to break the curse despite her captivity, Sorcha continues to work, little expecting that ultimately she will have to chose between saving her brothers and protecting the Briton lord who has defended her throughout her trials. Marillier's writing is deft and heartfelt, bypassing the usual bombast of fantasy fireworks for a rich, magical story of loyalty and love. <i>--Charlene Brusso</i><br>Juliet Marillier was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, a town with strong Scottish roots.

In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this <i>Joy</i> is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes. <p> Take the new <i>Joy</i> for a test-run in the kitchen with these featured recipes for Roast Brined Turkey and Apple Pie, and watch a video demonstration for their recipe for 10-in-One Cookies. And read on for celebrity chef "Odes to <i>Joy</i>," <i>Joy</i> timeline, and <i>Joy</i> trivia. </p> <br><b>Odes to <i>Joy</i></b><br> <p></p><br> "Great cookbooks are not just collections of interesting recipes. They are, first and foremost, books that tell a story, the story of how people lived and cooked at a particular point in time. They reveal, to borrow an expression from James Beard, their delights and prejudices, their view of the social order, their appetite for serving others food that meets the expectations of their social class. Food can be anything and everything from fuel to an object of intellectual curiosity to full-bore hedonism that transports the mind and body far from the dinner table with just one overwhelming bite. <p> I started cooking out of an early edition of Joy when I was only 7 years old. I remember making a basic chocolate cake with 7-minute frosting. The cake turned out fine, but the frosting resembled gruel and was my introduction to the importance of following a recipe to the letter. Evidently my lack of patience and precision had led me astray. But after that first brush with culinary failure, <i>Joy</i> led me to many, many successes over the years; more to the point, I became enamored of Ms. Rombauer's voice, the matter-of-fact charm that led her to suggest "stand facing the stove" as a sensible first step in any recipe. </p><p> The amateur but highly evolved enthusiasm that Irma Rombauer brought to the world of home cooking was a breath of fresh air after the slightly earlier era of culinary dowagers Fannie Farmer, Mrs. Beaton, and Marion Harland. To those pillars of culinary wisdom, recipes were shorthand for cooks who had spent a lifetime in the kitchen. A pie pastry recipe might be written as "make a paste." But Ms. Rombauer was there to hold our hands, to put food in a social context and give it attitude, energy, and meaning in a world where food was leaping past the narrow formality of the Victorian age. </p><p> For all of our worldly knowledge about ingredients and culinary custom, few cookbook authors have managed to perfectly capture, without artifice or self-conscious chatter, the vernacular of an age. Irma Rombauer introduced us to a room in our home--the kitchen--that was to become a place of enjoyment, not just one of backbreaking labor. She represented the essence of the new American experience, which suggested that everything in life could be transformed into pleasure with nothing more than the proper attitude. And what better way to celebrate this new age than to have a smashing cocktail party with the perfect hors d&#x2019;oeuvres? </p><p> The original <i>Joy of Cooking</i> was mind over matter, the perfect mix of attitude and function. Even as times have changed, the <i>Joy</i> stands out as a watershed volume, a book that speaks to the very heart of who we want to be in the kitchen: producers of our own story, directors of the good American life. </p><p> And, according to Ms. Rombauer, all we have to do is take that first easy step and "stand facing the stove." <b>--Christopher Kimball, founder and editor of <i>Cook's Illustrated</i></b> <br> <br> "I'm often asked to pick my favorite cookbook. Considering that there are over 3,000 cookbooks published each year, it's a daunting task to try to narrow them down. Speaking as a chef who never went to cooking school, I've been enthralled by certain cookbooks, immersing myself from cover to cover and learning about exotic cuisines from all over the world. But for just plain basic information, both the original and revised <i>Joy of Cooking</i> are still my bibles. I can't tell you how many times my wife Jackie and I have thumbed through the stained and broken-backed copy of <i>Joy</i> in our home kitchen, looking for our favorite angel food cake recipe, our favorite skillet corn bread, our favorite fluffy biscuits, and crisp waffles, and on and on. It's tough to picture my family table--or, in fact, the American table--without a well-worn copy of <i>Joy of Cooking</i> in the background." " <b>--Tom Douglas, author of <i>I Love Crab Cakes!</i></b> <br> <br> "I highly recommend this book as a must-have in your kitchen. Chock full of great information, this book takes all of the guess work out and leaves no stone unturned." <b>--Paula Deen, author of <i>Paula Deen Celebrates!</i></b><br> "In our kitchen, <i>Joy of Cooking</i> is a tool as indispensable as the chef's knife, the scale, the whisk. We actually own two copies--a shelf-copy for reading, and one whose sauce-splattered, dog-eared pages bear witness to just how much joy we get from <i>Joy</i>." " <b>--Matt Lee and Ted Lee, authors of <i>The Lee Bros. Southern Cookbook</i></b><br> "<i>Joy of Cooking</i> is the ultimate reference guide that I have been using for years. It's timeless and packed with perfect recipes for the home cook that stands up to the test of time." <b> --Tyler Florence, author of <i>Tyler's Ultimate</i></b><br> "<i>Joy of Cooking</i> is a book I turn to whenever I have a question about food or cooking. The new edition is the combined effort of some of the best cooks writing today; I know I can trust its information. And trust is, to my mind, the essential quality of all great cookbooks." <b>--Sally Schneider, author of <i>The Improvisational Cook</i></b><br> "When Andrew first contemplated becoming a chef in the 1980s, he asked two Boston chefs of his acquaintance what books he should read. Each independently recommended <i>Joy of Cooking</i> as <i>THE</i> classic with reliable recipes for just about everything. (The second chef urged him to look for an early copy for the sheer entertainment value of reading how to cook a possum.) A decade later, when we interviewed 60 of America&#x2019;s leading chefs for our first book <i>Becoming a Chef</i>, we asked them the same question--and again <i>Joy</i> was one of their five most recommended books. In fact, we recommend buying two copies, like we did: we keep our chocolate-smudged copy of <i>Joy</i> in our kitchen, and a reading copy on our bookshelves." <b>--Andrew Dorenburg and Karen Page, authors of <i>What to Drink with What You Eat</i></b><br> "Our <i>Joy of Cooking</i> is dog-eared, flour dusted, chocolate smudged, oil spattered, and easily the most used cookbook on the shelf. The staggering amount of information in the book taught us the basics when we were in our teens and has informed our cooking for the decades since. We wish we had written it!" <b>--Johanne Killeen and George Germon, authors of <i>On Top of Spaghetti</i></b><br> "I received a copy of <i>Joy of Cooking</i> in my late teens. I have treasured the cookbook ever since and still use it frequently as a reference. In the late 80's I was asked to represent American Cooking in Italy. I cooked all over the country for 2 months. The only book I took was <i>Joy of Cooking</i>. When ingredients that I had ordered did not show up and I had to totally wing it, I used this book to get me out of a few jams--like what the proportions are to make your own baking powder! If I could have only one cookbook--other than my own of course!--it would be <i>Joy of Cooking</i>&#x2013;-as it is the bible of American cooking" <b>--Kathy Casey, author of <i>Kathy Casey's Northwest Table</i></b><br> "I have purchased <i>Joy of Cooking</i> for all my restaurant libraries as well as my own. The recipes always work--always--and the informational chapters are accurate, to the point, and incredibly helpful--couldn&#x2019;t live with out it!!" <b>--Cindy Pawlcyn, author of <i>Big Small Plates</i></b><br> </p> <p></p><b>A Brief History of<i>Joy</i></b> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p> � <b>1930</b>: The United States stock market crashes creating the great depression.<br> � <b>1931</b>: Irma Rombauer takes $3,000, the modest legacy her husband leaves at his death, and she self-publishes the first <i>Joy of Cooking</i>.

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health. All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported. The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals. The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described -- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep -- with illustrations of each pepper. An all-new "RULES" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle. New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles: Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes. New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake -- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch. Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons. AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy. </p><p>Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections. </p><p>From cover to cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers. An invaluable combination of old and new, this edition of Joy of Cooking promises to keep you cooking for years to come.</p></p><h2>School&#39;s Out - Forever: A Maximum Ride Novel (Book 2)</h2><p>&#34;Adventure, fighting, backstabbing and love abound&#34; (VOYA) in this action-packed follow-up to the #1 New York Times blockbuster MAXIMUM RIDE: THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT, now available in paperback. The heart-stopping quest of six winged kids--led by fourteen-year-old Max--to find their parents and investigate the mind-blowing mystery of their ultimate destiny continues when they&#39;re taken under the wing of an FBI agent and attempt, for the first time, to live &#34;normal&#34; lives.

He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>In the second installment in the Maximum Ride series, Max and her flock of genetically altered children are moving closer to understanding the reason for their existence--or at least for the modifications that have been made to them. Valentina de Angelis sets off at a strong pace in a narration that betrays a fondness for her characters in a tone pitched for kids. The periodic musical background is a bit of a distraction, however. It varies in length and at times appears to be a signal that a chapter is ending, at other times an indication of abridgment, and at still other times simply background. The longer passages add a sense of sentimentality that seems unwarranted. J.E.M.

At its center is a romance: the story of the author's relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson's account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, offers a firsthand account of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making. <br> Writing in the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.</p></p><p><b>Maggie Nelson</b> is a poet, critic, and nonfiction author of books such as <i>The Art of Cruelty: A Reckoning</i>, <i>Bluets</i>, and <i>Jane: A Murder</i>. She teaches in the School of Critical Studies at CalArts and lives in Los Angeles, California.<p>&#x201c;[Nelson's] book-part memoir, part critical inquiry touching on desire, love, and family-is a superb exploration of the risk and the excitement of change.

There's the violence I commit in making a claim for that futurity, and the violence I endure when that claim is granted. There's the exhaustive sharing that takes form as writing. There's the 'orgy of specificity' when the inexpressible is held and released in each expression 'cause I just want to sing your name even when I don't want to sing your name. There's the love story buried in every 'I love you,' and in every 'I love you' there's a contract for destruction and rebuilding.

The military hasn&#x2019;t decided yet whether to make him a hero for surviving the attack, or have him court-martialed for losing the boat, and the last thing the Kennedy clan wants is a murder charge hanging over his head.

Again. I glanced at the clerk pecking away at his typewriter, avoiding my eyes. I&#x2019;d asked him the same question so often he&#x2019;d begun to ignore me, in the polite fashion of a busy corporal who didn&#x2019;t want to be pestered by a dimea-dozen second lieutenant who&#x2019;d drifted in from another outfit.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is the flight expected in?<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Dunno, sir.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Who am I supposed to meet?<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Dunno, sir.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Where is your commanding officer?<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Dunno, sir.</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He was very good at not knowing anything. I paced the room, back and forth along the tall windows that fronted the airfield, watching the sky for a glimpse of B-24 bombers. It was cool inside, the whitewashed stonework keeping out the midday Moroccan heat.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Relax, Billy,&#x201d; Kaz said. He tilted back in his chair, crossing his legs, but not before shaking out the crease in his trousers. Kaz dressed only in tailored uniforms, even when it was desert khaki. Lieutenant Piotr Augustus Kazimierz&#x2014;Kaz to his friends&#x2014;was with the Polish Army in Exile, attached to General Eisenhower&#x2019;s headquarters. Kaz was a real baron as well, which he usually only brought up when trying to get a decent table at a restaurant. In French Morocco or Algeria, a baron easily outranked a colonel, at least as far as any decent ma�tre d&#x2019; was concerned.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Relax? I <i>was</i> relaxed, back at the Hotel Saint George in Algiers,&#x201d; I said, knowing I sounded half-crazed. Yesterday I&#x2019;d been ready for some well-needed leave with my girl in the swankiest joint in Algiers, and now here I was waiting for who-knows-what at an army airfield six hundred miles away. &#x201c;How can I relax when even General Eisenhower didn&#x2019;t know about these orders?&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;If worrying and pacing would help, I would join you,&#x201d; Kaz said, tossing aside the week-old newspaper he&#x2019;d been reading. It was the <i>Miami Herald</i>, dog-eared and yellowed after its long journey. Anfa Airfield was on the Air Transport Command run from the States. Miami to Puerto Rico, then down to Brazil, over the Atlantic to Dakar and up to Casablanca. The flight office was a good place to pick up discarded newspapers from home and see what the civilian world was up to. I glanced at the front page and saw that coal miners were out on strike, even though the United Mine Workers had made a no-strike pledge when the war began. FDR was threatening to end deferments for any miners who stayed out on strike, but only a few had returned to work. Steel mills had been shut down for two weeks without coal to fuel their furnaces. No coal meant no steel. No steel meant no tanks, bayonets, or destroyers. I should have gone straight to the funnies.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;They came direct from the War Department,&#x201d; I said, dropping into the chair next to Kaz, struggling to keep my voice low. &#x201c;Signed by General Marshall himself, Army Chief of Staff. He&#x2019;s <i>Ike</i>&#x2019;s boss.&#x201d; <br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;I am well aware of who General Marshall is,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;If I had not been, the twenty or so times you have told me since we left Algiers would&#x2019;ve sufficed to inform me.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you find it strange that our boss&#x2019;s boss is sending us orders direct from Washington D.C.? And that General Eisenhower doesn&#x2019;t have a clue what it&#x2019;s all about? Never mind the fact that we&#x2019;re stuck here waiting for a courier and no one seems to know anything?&#x201d; I failed utterly at keeping my voice low. The corporal ceased his typing and looked up at me, shaking his head wearily.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;It is strange,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;But then, life is strange, is it not? I never thought I would serve in the British Army, much less work for our general, and with you to keep me company. So what is one more small<br>surprise? Patience, Billy.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time for patience,&#x201d; I said, and rose to get back to my pacing. I thought I heard Kaz stifle a laugh, or maybe it was the corporal. I didn&#x2019;t care. I&#x2019;d left Diana Seaton back in Algiers, which was where I wanted to be right now. Diana is an agent with the Special Operations Executive. She&#x2019;s a lady, an authentic British aristocrat. I&#x2019;m Boston Irish, and hardly a fancy-pants kind of guy. We make one damned odd couple. Diana&#x2019;s last assignment had been a rough one, and we had both been looking forward to a week of time to ourselves. Maybe this summons would amount to nothing and I&#x2019;d be back at the Hotel Saint George in time for dinner. Hell, if worrying doesn&#x2019;t help, as Kaz said, why not be an optimist? I tried, but he was much more practiced at nonchalance than I&#x2019;d ever be.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Kaz hasn&#x2019;t had an easy time in this war either, but that&#x2019;s a long story. The scar he got last year has healed as well as expected, but it&#x2019;s still the first thing you notice when you see him. A jagged line from eye to cheekbone, it&#x2019;s a constant reminder of all he&#x2019;s lost. Both of the people I&#x2019;m closest to over here have lost what&#x2019;s most dear in their lives, so I tend to be protective of them. Quite a job in wartime.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Two P-38 Lightning fighters swept in over the airstrip, distracting me from thoughts of personal losses. They banked low and disappeared beyond the rolling green hills facing the sea. I strained my eyes and thought I saw tiny dots in the distance. The B-24s? Perhaps the fighters had been their escorts.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Lieutenant Boyle?&#x201d; A door slammed and a major in rumpled khakis strode into the flight office, a cigarette dangling from his lips. He glanced at the corporal who indicated me.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Yes sir,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Can you tell me anything? We&#x2019;ve been waiting for hours.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;All I know is I&#x2019;m supposed to give the two of you use of my office, to meet with a US Navy officer on this incoming flight from Dakar. He&#x2019;ll be brought straight here.&#x201d; He drew on his cigarette and spit out a bit of tobacco. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t ask me any goddamn questions because I don&#x2019;t have any goddamn answers. Make it snappy and clear out of my goddamn office pronto, I&#x2019;ve got an airbase to run. Understood?&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Yes sir,&#x201d; I said. We followed him down the hall to an office facing the runway, floor-to-ceiling windows giving a clear view of incoming aircraft. The sign on the door said Major Kilpatrick, Executive Officer. Whoever was behind all this had enough clout to make a major nervous. For all his bluster, I could tell Kilpatrick was putting the best face on a bad situation. Hell, it made me nervous too.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Do not sit at my desk, Lieutenant,&#x201d; Kilpatrick said. I nodded my agreement as he crushed out his cigarette in the overflowing ashtray, leaving it smoldering as he departed, curses issuing from between clenched teeth. Kaz flopped into one of the chairs facing the tall windows overlooking the runway.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;As usual, we have not made a friend,&#x201d; Kaz said, his smile tight, almost a grimace, where it touched the scar. &#x201c;Mere lieutenants with orders from powerful men are viewed with such suspicion. It shows how insecure most officers really are.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;For some guys, the rank is all they have. Junior officers with clout upset their view of the world,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I knew a few cops like that back in Boston. But you can&#x2019;t blame Major Kilpatrick. No one likes being tossed out of their digs, even for an hour.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;Although he could have been more courteous. I am tempted to sit at his precious desk in retribution.&#x201d; Kaz&#x2019;s eyes sparkled behind his steel-rimmed spectacles, and I was glad to see his impish humor hadn&#x2019;t entirely disappeared. Kaz was thin-framed, his motions languid, as if he could barely be troubled to endure the follies<br>of the world. In the right light he reminded me of Leslie Howard, the English actor who&#x2019;d been killed while flying over the Bay of Biscay a couple of months ago. More so now that Howard was dead, I think. Death became Kaz. It haunted him and he haunted it right back. I was worried that one day he&#x2019;d follow the grim reaper wherever he led him, but until then I kept my eye on my friend, trying to keep him amused. And alive.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; I said, as an array of dots coalesced into a formation of B-24s approaching the airfield. PB4Ys, as the navy called them. I could make out the camouflage colors, white on the bottom and a dull gray on top. These guys were probably headed for antisubmarine duty, hunting U-boats in the Mediterranean or off the Atlantic coast of France. What that had to do with me, I had not a clue.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The big four-engine bombers lumbered in for a landing, jeeps and trucks racing out to direct them as they taxied off the runway. We watched as engines switched off and crews exited the aircraft, stretching after hours in cramped, cold quarters. No one seemed in a hurry. Crewmen began climbing aboard trucks which rolled off toward buildings on the other side of the runway. Mess hall, perhaps. If they&#x2019;d flown in from Dakar, they&#x2019;d probably been making the South Atlantic run from the States. I&#x2019;d be hungry myself, but if I carried orders from General Marshall I might put that aside.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&#x201c;Perhaps this is not the flight we are waiting for,&#x201d; Kaz said.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>I was almost ready to agree when a jeep with an officer at the wheel raced across the runway, straight for us. It was a navy officer, still wearing his fleece-lined leather jacket in the North African heat. That had to be our man.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The jeep braked hard a few yards short of the window, spraying a cloud of dust that swirled around the driver. He got out and removed his flying cap and leather jacket, tossing them nonchalantly on the seat as he looked around, waiting for someone.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Then I recognized him. Square jaw, thick black hair, gleaming eyes.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>It was Joe Goddamn Kennedy.</p><h2>Marco Polo: From Venice to Xanadu</h2><p>As the most celebrated European to explore Asia, Marco Polo was the original global traveler and the earliest bridge between East and West. A universal icon of adventure and discovery, he has inspired six centuries of popular fascination and spurious mythology. Now, from the acclaimed author of <i>Over the Edge of the World: Magellan&#x2019;s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe</i> (&#x201c;Superb . . . A first-rate historical page turner&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i>)&#x2014;comes the first fully authoritative biography of one of the most enchanting figures in world history. In this masterly work, Marco Polo&#x2019;s incredible odyssey&#x2014;along the Silk Road and through all the fantastic circumstances of his life&#x2014;is chronicled in sumptuous and illuminating detail.<br><br>We meet him as a callow young man, the scion of a wealthy Venetian merchant family, only seventeen when he sets out in 1271 with his father and uncle on their journey to Asia. We see him gain the confidence of Kublai Khan, the world&#x2019;s most feared and powerful leader, and watch him become a trusted diplomat and intelligence agent in the ruler&#x2019;s inner circle. We are privy to his far-flung adventures on behalf of the Khan, living among the Mongols and other tribes, and traveling to magical cities, some far advanced over the West. We learn the customs of the Khan&#x2019;s court, both erotic and mercantile, and Polo&#x2019;s uncanny ability to adapt to them. We follow him on his journey back to Venice, laden with riches, the latest inventions, and twenty-four years&#x2019; worth of extraordinary tales.<br><br>And we see his collaboration with the famed writer Rustichello of Pisa, who immediately saw in Polo the story of a lifetime; enlivened by his genius for observation, Polo&#x2019;s tales needed little embellishment. Recorded by Rustichello as the two languished as prisoners of war in a Genoese jail, the<i> Travels</i> would explode the notion of non-Europeans as untutored savages and stand as the definitive description of China until the nineteenth century.<br><br>Drawing on original sources in more than half a dozen languages, and on his own travels along Polo&#x2019;s route in China and Mongolia, Bergreen explores the lingering controversies surrounding Polo&#x2019;s legend, settling age-old questions and testing others for significance.

Now Dane Rudhyar has taken these symbols and reinterpreted them to emphasize their character as a cyclic and structured series which formalizes and reveals the archetypal meaning of 360 basic phases of human experience. Rudhyar also demonstrates how the Sabian symbols can be used for divination. Like Tarot cards and the I Ching, they provide clues to the best way to face anxieties, or suggest what alternative courses of action might mean in one&#39;s life. In the form of pictures that are easily recognizable to people today, these symbols can be said to constitute a contemporary, American I Ching, a series of symbols that goes to the very root of planetary significance for our present era.</p><p><p>"Dane Rudhyar's Astrological Mandala is invaluable not only for the student of astrology but for every person seriously interested in symbols as a medium for achieving the kind of transformation necessary to bring about the 'new age.' That this book is primarily practical as well as informative only underlines the real significance of this most unusual gift from a man rare in any age."</p><p>-- Jose A.

It wasn&#x2019;t until he wrote a highly uncomplimentary poem about a senior executive at the agency he worked, however, that his talent was revealed. It turned out one of the company directors agreed with John&#x2019;s assessment of the executive, and happily agreed to train John in copywriting. <p> After writing advertising copy for the next two decades, John teamed with an old friend to develop a television sitcom, <i>Hey Dad!</i>, which went on to air for eight years. </p><p> John began writing <i>Ranger&#x2019;s Apprentice</i> for his son, Michael, ten years ago, and is still hard at work on the series. He currently lives in the suburb of Manly, Australia, with his wife. In addition to their son, they have two grown daughters and four grandsons. </p><p></p>&nbsp;<p>5 </p><p>IT WAS LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE FLICKERING TORCHES around the castle yard, already replaced once, had begun to burn low again.Will had watched patiently for hours, waiting for this moment&#x2014;when the light was uncertain and the guards were yawning, in the last hour of their shift.</p><p>The day had been one of the worst he could remember.While his yearmates celebrated, enjoying their feast and then spending their time in lighthearted horseplay through the castle and the village, Will had slipped away to the silence of the forest, a kilometer or so from the castle walls. There, in the dim green coolness beneath the trees, he had spent the afternoon reflecting bitterly on the events of the Choosing, nursing the deep pain of disappointment and wondering what the Ranger&#x2019;s paper said. </p><p>As the long day wore on, and the shadows began to lengthen in the open fields beside the forest, he came to a decision. He had to know what was on the paper. And he had to know tonight. </p><p>Once night fell, he made his way back to the castle, avoiding villagers and castle folk alike, and secreted himself in the branches of the fig tree again. On the way, he slipped unnoticed into the kitchens and helped himself to bread, cheese and apples.He munched moodily on these, barely tasting them, as the evening passed and the castle began to settle down for the night. </p><p>He observed the movements of the guards, getting a feeling for their timing as they went on their regular rounds. In addition to the guard troop, there was a sergeant on duty at the doorway of the tower that led to Baron Arald&#x2019;s quarters. But he was overweight and sleepy and there was little chance that he would pose a risk to Will. After all, he had no intention of using the door or the stairway. Over the years, his insatiable curiosity, and a penchant for going places where he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to, had developed within him the skill of moving across seemingly open space without being seen. As the wind stirred the upper branches of the trees, they created moving patterns in the moonlight&#x2014;patterns that Will now used to great effect.He instinctively matched his movement to the rhythm of the trees, blending easily into the pattern of the yard, becoming part of it and so being concealed by it. In a way, the lack of obvious cover made his task a little easier.The fat sergeant didn&#x2019;t expect anyone to be moving across the open space of the yard. So, not expecting to see anyone, he failed to do so. </p><p>Breathless,Will flattened himself against the rough stone of the tower wall.The sergeant was barely five meters away and Will could hear his heavy breathing, but a small buttress in the wall hid him from the man&#x2019;s sight. He studied the wall in front of him, craning back to look up.The Baron&#x2019;s office window was a long way up, and farther around the tower.To reach it, he would have to climb up, then work his way across the face of the wall, to a spot beyond the point where the sergeant stood guard, then up again to the window. He licked his lips nervously.Unlike the smooth inner walls of the tower, the huge blocks of stone that comprised the tower&#x2019;s outer wall had large gaps between them.Climbing would be no problem.He&#x2019;d have plenty of foot- and handholds all the way up. In some places, the stone would have been worn smooth by the weather over the years, he knew, and he&#x2019;d have to go carefully. But he&#x2019;d climbed all the other three towers at some time in the past and he expected no real difficulty with this one. </p><p>But this time, if he were seen, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to pass it off as a prank.He would be climbing in the middle of the night to a part of the castle where he had no right to be.After all, the Baron didn&#x2019;t post guards on this tower for the fun of it. People were supposed to stay away unless they had business here. </p><p>He rubbed his hands together nervously.What could they do to him? He had already been passed over in the Choosing. Nobody wanted him.He was condemned to a life in the fields already.What could be worse than that? </p><p>But there was a nagging doubt at the back of his mind:He wasn&#x2019;t absolutely sure that he was condemned to that life.A faint spark of hope still remained.Perhaps the Baron would relent.Perhaps, ifWill pleaded with him in the morning, and explained about his father and how important it was for him to be accepted for Battleschool, there was a very faint chance that his wish would be granted. And then, once he was accepted, he could show how his eagerness and dedication would make him a worthy student, until his growing spurt happened. On the other hand, if he were caught in the next few minutes, not even that small chance would remain.He had no idea what they would do to him if he were caught, but he could be reasonably sure that it wouldn&#x2019;t involve being accepted into Battleschool. </p><p>He hesitated, needing some slight extra push to get him going. It was the fat sergeant who provided it.Will heard the heavy intake of breath, the shuffling of the man&#x2019;s studded boots against the flagstones as he gathered his equipment together, and he realized that the sergeant was about to make one of his irregular circuits of his beat.Usually, this entailed going a few meters around the tower to either side of the doorway, then returning to his original position. It was more for the purpose of staying awake than anything else, but Will realized that it would bring them face-to-face within the next few seconds if he didn&#x2019;t do something. </p><p>Quickly, easily, he began to swarm up the wall.He made the first five meters in a matter of seconds, spread out against the rough stone like a giant, four-legged spider.Then, hearing the heavy footsteps directly below him, he froze, clinging to the wall in case some slight noise might alert the sentry. </p><p>In fact, it seemed that the sergeant had heard something. He paused directly below the point where Will clung, peering into the night, trying to see past the dappled, moving shadows cast by the moon and the swaying trees. But, as Will had thought the night before, people seldom look up. The sergeant, eventually satisfied that he had heard nothing significant, continued to march slowly around the tower. </p><p>That was the chance Will needed. It also gave him the opportunity to move across the tower face so that he was directly below the window he wanted. Hands and feet finding purchase easily, he moved almost as fast as a man could walk, all the time going higher and higher up the tower wall. </p><p>At one point, he looked down and that was a mistake. Despite his good head for heights, his vision swam slightly as he saw how far he had come, and how far below him the hard flagstones of the castle yard were.The sergeant was coming back into view&#x2014;a tiny figure when seen from this height.Will blinked the moment of vertigo away and continued to climb, perhaps a little more slowly and with a little more care than before. </p><p>There was a heart-stopping moment when, stretching his right foot to a new foothold, his left boot slipped on the weather-rounded edge of the massive building blocks, and he was left clinging by his hands alone as he desperately scrabbled for a foothold.Then he recovered and kept moving. </p><p>He felt a surge of relief as his hands finally closed over the stone window ledge and he heaved himself up and into the room, swinging his legs over the sill and dropping lightly inside. The Baron&#x2019;s office was deserted, of course. The three-quarter moon streamed light in through the big window. </p><p>And there, on the desk where the Baron had left it, was the single sheet of paper that held the answer to Will&#x2019;s future. Nervously, he glanced around the room. The Baron&#x2019;s huge, high-backed chair stood like a sentry behind the desk.The few other pieces of furniture loomed dark and motionless. On one wall, a portrait of one of the Baron&#x2019;s ancestors glared down at him, accusingly. He shook off these fanciful thoughts and crossed quickly to the desk, his soft boots making no noise on the bare boards of the floor. The sheet of paper, bright white with the reflected moonlight, was within reach. Just look at it, read it and go, he told himself.That was all he had to do.He stretched out a hand for it. </p><p>His fingers touched it. </p><p>And a hand shot out of nowhere and seized him by the wrist! Will shouted aloud in fright. His heart leaped into his mouth and he found himself looking up into the cold eyes of Halt the Ranger. </p><p>Where had he come from? Will had been sure there had been nobody else in the room. And there had been no sound of a door opening.Then he remembered how the Ranger could wrap himself in that strange, mottled, gray-green cloak of his and seem to melt into the background, blending with the shadows until he was invisible. Not that it mattered how Halt had done it. The real problem was that he had caught Will, here in the Baron&#x2019;s office. And that meant the end to all Will&#x2019;s hopes. </p><p>&#x201c;Thought you might try something like this,&#x201d; said the Ranger in a low voice. </p><p>Will, his heart pounding from the shock of the last few moments, said nothing.He hung his head in shame and despair. </p><p>&#x201c;Do you have anything to say?&#x201d;Halt asked him, and Will shook his head, unwilling to look up and meet that dark, penetrating gaze. Halt&#x2019;s next words confirmed Will&#x2019;s worst fears. </p><p>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s see what the Baron thinks about this,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;Please,Halt! Not . . .&#x201d;Then Will stopped.There was no excuse for what he had done and the least he could do was face his punishment like a man. Like a warrior. Like his father, he thought. The Ranger studied him for a moment.Will thought he saw a brief flicker of . . . recognition? Then the eyes darkened oncemore. </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;Halt said curtly.Will shook his head. </p><p>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; </p><p>The Ranger&#x2019;s grip was like iron around his wrist as he led Will out the door and onto the wide, curving staircase that led up to the Baron&#x2019;s living quarters.The sentries at the head of the stairs looked up in surprise at the sight of the grim-faced Ranger and the boy beside him. At a brief signal from Halt, they stood aside and opened the doors into the Baron&#x2019;s apartment. </p><p>The room was brightly lit and, for a moment,Will looked around in confusion.He was sure he had seen the lights go out on this floor while he waited and watched in the tree.Then he saw the heavy drapes across the window and understood. In contrast to the Baron&#x2019;s sparsely furnished working quarters below, this roomwas a comfortable clutter of settees, footstools, carpets, tapestries and armchairs. In one of these, Baron Arald sat, reading through a pile of reports. </p><p>He looked up from the page he was holding as Halt entered with his captive. </p><p>&#x201c;So you were right,&#x201d; said the Baron, and Halt nodded. </p><p>&#x201c;Just as I said,my lord.Came across the castle yard like a shadow. Dodged the sentry as if he wasn&#x2019;t there and came up the tower wall like a spider.&#x201d; </p><p>The Baron set the report down on a side table and leaned forward. </p><p>&#x201c;He climbed the tower, you say?&#x201d; he asked, a trifle incredulously. </p><p>&#x201c;No rope.No ladder,my lord.Climbed it as easily as you get on your horse in the morning. Easier, in fact,&#x201d;Halt said, with just the ghost of a smile. </p><p>The Baron frowned.He was a little overweight and sometimes he needed help getting on his horse after a late night.He obviously wasn&#x2019;t amused by Halt&#x2019;s reminding him of the fact. </p><p>&#x201c;Well now,&#x201d; he said, looking sternly at Will, &#x201c;this is a serious matter.&#x201d; </p><p>Will said nothing.He wasn&#x2019;t sure if he should agree or disagree. Either course had its dangers. But he wished Halt hadn&#x2019;t put the Baron in a bad mood by referring to his weight. It certainly wouldn&#x2019;t make things any better for him. </p><p>&#x201c;So, what shall we do with you, young Will?&#x201d; the Baron continued. He rose from his chair and began to pace.Will looked up at him, trying to gauge his mood. The strong, bearded face told him nothing. The Baron stopped his pacing and fingered his beard thoughtfully. </p><p>&#x201c;Tell me, young Will,&#x201d; he said, facing away from the miserable boy,&#x201c;what would you do in my place? What would you do with a boy who broke into your office in the middle of the night and tried to steal an important document?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t stealing,my lord!&#x201d;The denial burst from Will before he could contain it.The Baron turned to him, one eyebrow raised in apparent disbelief.Will continued weakly,&#x201c;I just . . . wanted to see it, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps so,&#x201d; said the Baron, that eyebrow still raised.&#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t answered my question.What would you do in my place?&#x201d; Will hung his head again.He could plead.He could apologize. He could ask for mercy.He could try to explain.But then he squared his shoulders and came to a decision. He had known the consequences of being caught.And he had chosen to take the risk.He had no right now to plead for forgiveness. </p><p>&#x201c;My lord . . . ,&#x201d; he said, hesitantly, knowing that this was a decisive moment in his life. The Baron regarded him, still half turned from the window. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; he said, and Will somehow found the resolve to go on. &#x201c;My lord, I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;d do in your place. I do know there is no excuse for my actions and I will accept whatever punishment you decide.&#x201d; </p><p>As he spoke, he raised his face to look the Baron in the eye.And in doing so, he caught the Baron&#x2019;s quick glance to Halt. There was something in that glance, he saw. Strangely, it was almost a look of approval, or agreement.Then it was gone. </p><p>&#x201c;Any suggestions, Halt?&#x201d; the Baron asked, in a carefully neutral tone. </p><p>Will looked at the Ranger now.His face was stern, as it always was. The grizzled gray beard and short hair made him seem even more disapproving,more ominous. </p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps we should show him the paper he was so keen to see, my lord,&#x201d; he said, producing the single sheet from inside his sleeve. The Baron allowed a smile to break through.&#x201c;Not a bad idea,&#x201d; he said.&#x201c;I suppose, in a way, it does spell out his punishment, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Will glanced from one man to the other. There was something going on here that he didn&#x2019;t understand.The Baron seemed to think that what he had just said was rather amusing. Halt, on the other hand, wasn&#x2019;t sharing in the fun. </p><p>&#x201c;If you say so, my lord,&#x201d; he replied evenly. The Baron waved a hand at him impatiently. </p><p>&#x201c;Take a joke, Halt! Take a joke! Well, go on and show him the paper.&#x201d; </p><p>The Ranger crossed the room and handed Will the sheet he had risked so much to see. His hand trembled as he took it. His punishment? But how had the Baron known he would deserve punishment before the actual event? </p><p>He realized that the Baron was watching him expectantly.Halt, as ever,was an impassive statue.Will unfolded the sheet and read the words Halt had written there. </p><p>The boy Will has the potential to be trained as a Ranger. </p><p>I will accept him as my apprentice. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Beaded Garden: Creating Flowers with Beads and Thread</h2><p><p>Using needle and thread, crafters of all skill levels can create a veritable greenhouse of beaded flowers from the patterns in this book.

Now, as he lies dying in one of his own buildings, his grandson Jamie comes home to watch over him. It is Jamie who tells the story of his family, of three generations of pride and delusion, of nationality and strong drink, of Catholic faith and the end of political idealism. It is a tale of darkness amidst the search for Utopia. A poignant and very powerful reclamation of the past, Our Fathers is also a clearsighted and beautifully crafted look at public and personal history.<br></p><p>In literature, at least, most family sagas conform to a fairly simple pattern: rise and fall. Seldom, however, does this narrative arc take so concrete a shape as it does in <i>Our Fathers</i>. The hero of Andrew O'Hagan's first novel has spent the postwar era preaching the virtues of modern housing: "Most of the high-rises on the west coast of Scotland were made, or inspired, out of Hugh Bawn's zeal, and his tireless days as a housing boss. A priest of steel decking and concrete was Hugh." Yet the novel is narrated by this master builder's grandson, Jamie, who happens to make his living as an urban demolition expert. More than once he's helped to tear down the very edifices his grandfather erected--setting off both literal and Oedipal explosions in the process.<p> Now, however, Hugh is on his deathbed, and Jamie has returned to Ayrshire to make peace with the old man. Not surprisingly, he also finds himself reckoning with the shadow of his father--a brutal drunk who managed to alienate three generations of the family in one go. As its title suggests, O'Hagan's novel is primarily a meditation on paternity, which in Scotland, anyway, seems to amount to the kiss of death: </p><blockquote> In my father's anger there was something of the nation. Everything torn from the ground; his mind like a rotten field.... Our fathers were made for grief. They were broken-backed. They were sick at heart, weak in the bones. All they wanted was the peace of defeat. They couldn't live in this world. They couldn't stand who they were. </blockquote> To his credit, Jamie can hardly stand who he is, either: he senses that grief and weakness aren't merely national conditions but human ones. And as Andrew O'Hagan's mouthpiece, he attains some splendid rhetorical heights. Yet his voice gets muffled, and sometimes silenced entirely, by the author's multigenerational ambitions. There are too many Bawns in this novel, too many tales, and too many miserable transactions between father and son. O'Hagan's prose is perhaps worth the price of admission. Yet <i>Our Fathers</i>, like the Scots communities that Jamie so explosively reshapes, is itself a victim of excessive sprawl. <i>--James Marcus</i><p>ANDREW O'HAGAN was born in Glasgow, Scotland.&nbsp;His previous novels&nbsp;have been awarded the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize,&nbsp;the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the E.

When Duke Atreides and his family take up court there they fall into a trap set by his rival.</p><p>This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the "spice of spices." Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. <p> The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah. His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. </p><p> <i>Dune</i> is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so.

When he becomes embroiled in a civil war between Egypt's King Ptolemy and Queen Cleopatra, he finds himself torn between the fascinations of a remarkable woman and his duty as a Roman. Though he must leave Cleopatra, she remains a force in his life as a lover and as the mother of his only son, who can never inherit Caesar's Roman mantle, and therefore cannot solve his father's greatest dilemma -- who will be Caesar's Roman heir? </p><p> A hero to all of Rome except to those among his colleagues who see his dictatorial powers as threats to the democratic system they prize so highly, Caesar is determined not to be worshiped as a god or crowned king, but his unique situation conspires to make it seem otherwise. Swearing to bring him down, Caesar's enemies masquerade as friends and loyal supporters while they plot to destroy him. Among them are his cousin and Master of the Horse, Mark Antony, feral and avaricious, priapic and impulsive; Gaius Trebonius, the nobody, who owes him everything; Gaius Cassius, eaten by jealousy; and the two Brutuses, his cousin Decimus, and Marcus, the son of his mistress Servilia, sad victim of his mother and of his uncle Cato, whose daughter he marries. All are in Caesar's debt, all have been raised to high positions, all are outraged by Caesar's autocracy. </p><p> Caesar must die, they decide, for only when he is dead will Rome return to her old ways, her old republican self. </p><p> With her extraordinary knowledge of Roman history, Colleen McCullough brings Caesar to life as no one has ever done before and surrounds him with an enormous and vivid cast of historical characters, characters like Cleopatra who call to us from beyond the centuries, for McCullough's genius is to make them live again without losing any of the grandeur that was Rome. </p><p> Packed with battles on land and sea, with intrigue, love affairs, and murders, the novel moves with amazing speed toward the assassination itself, and then into the ever more complex and dangerous consequences of that act, in which the very fate of Rome is at stake. </p><p> <i>The October Horse</i> is about one of the world's pivotal eras, relating as it does events that have continued to echo even into our own times.</p></p><p><b>Colleen Mccullough</b> was born in Australia.

She lives on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific with her husband, Ric Robinson.<p><b>Introduction</b> </p><p> The Ides of October marked the end of the campaigning season, and on that day a race was held on the grassy sward of the Campus Martius, just outside the Servian Walls of Republican Rome. </p><p> The year's best war horses were harnessed in pairs to chariots and driven at breakneck pace; the right-hand one of the winning pair became the October Horse, and was ritually killed with a spear by the <i>flamen Martialis,</i> the special priest of Mars, who was god of war. Then the October Horse's head and genitalia were amputated. The genitals were rushed to bleed on the sacred hearth in the Regia, Rome's oldest temple, after which they were given to the Vestal Virgins to burn to ashes in the sacred flame of Vesta; later these ashes were mixed into cakes offered on the anniversary of the founding of Rome by her first king, Romulus. The decorated head was tossed into the midst of two teams of humble citizens, one from the Subura district, one from the Sacra Via district, who fought strenuously for possession of it. If the Subura won, the head was nailed to the Turris Mamilia. If the Sacra Via won, the head was nailed to an outer wall of the Regia. </p><p> In this ritual so old that no one remembered how it had begun, the very best that Rome owned was sacrificed to the twin powers that ruled her: war and land. Out of them came her might, her prosperity, her everlasting glory. The death of the October Horse was at once a mourning of the past and a vision of the future. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Colleen McCullough</p></p><h2>Brothers Karamazov</h2><p>This is a translation of Dostoevsky&#39;s most widely read novel - at once a murder mystery, a mordant comedy of family intrigue, a pioneering work of psychological realism and an unblinking look into the abyss of human suffering.</p><p>Introduction by Malcolm Jones; Translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa VolokhonskyFyodor Dostoevsky&#39;s life was as dark and dramatic as the great novels he wrote.

If he wishes to remain alive, he must flee his tiny village.</p><p>Genre-jumping author Avi clocks in here with his 50th book, <i>Crispin: The Cross of Lead</i>, an action-packed historical narrative that follows the frantic flight of a 13-year-old peasant boy across 14th-century England.<p> After being declared a "wolf's head" by his manor's corrupt steward for a crime he didn't commit (meaning that anyone can kill him like a common animal--<i>and</i> collect a reward), this timid boy has to flee a tiny village that's the only world he's ever known. But before our protagonist escapes, Avi makes sure that we're thoroughly briefed on the injustices of feudalism--the countless taxes cottars must pay, the constant violence, the inability of a flawed church to protect its parishioners, etc. Avi then folds in the book's central mystery just as the boy is leaving: "Asta's son," as he's always been known, learns from the village priest that his Christian name is Crispin, and that his parents' origins--and fates--might be more perplexing than he ever imagined.</p><p> Providing plenty of period detail (appropriately gratuitous for the age group) and plenty of chase-scene suspense, Avi tells a good story, develops a couple of fairly compelling characters, and even manages to teach a little history lesson.

A low, dense mass of clouds completely covered the sky as though a great gray tarp had been drawn from one corner to another. Not a single leaf fluttered. The sirocco was late to rise from its leaden sleep, yet people already struggled to exchange a few words. The foreman, before assign- ing the areas to be cleaned, announced that this day, and for some days to come, Peppe Schmmari and Caluzzo Brucculeri would be absent, excused from work. More than excused, they'd been arrested: the previous evening they'd attempted to rob a supermarket, weapons in hand. To Pino Catalano and Saro Montaperto-young land surveyors naturally without employment as land surveyors, but hired by Splendor as temporary "ecological agents" thanks to the generous string-pulling of Chamber Deputy Cusumano, in whose electoral campaign the two had fought body and soul (and in that order, with the body doing far more than the soul felt like doing)-the foreman assigned the jobs vacated by Peppe and Caluzzo, that is, the sector that went by the name of "the Pasture," because in a time now beyond memory a goatherd had apparently let his goats roam there. It was a broad tract of Mediterranean brush on the outskirts of town that stretched almost as far as the shore. Behind it lay the ruins of a large chemical works inaugurated by the ubiquitous Deputy Cusumano when it seemed the magnificent winds of progress were blowing strong. Soon, however, that breeze changed into the flimsiest of puffs before dropping altogether, but in that brief time it had managed to do more damage than a tornado, leaving a shambles of compensation benefits and unemployment in its wake. To prevent the crowds of black and not-so-black Senegalese, Algerians, Tunisians, and Libyans wandering about the city from nesting in that factory, a high wall had been built all around it, above which the old structures still soared, corroded by weather, neglect, and sea salt, looking more and more like architectures designed by Gaud� under the influence of hallucinogens.<p>Until recently the Pasture had represented, for those who at the time still went under the undignified name of garbage collectors, a cakewalk of a job: amid the scraps of paper, plastic bags, cans of beer and Coca-Cola, and shit piles barely covered up or left out in the open air, now and then a used condom would appear, and it would set one thinking, provided one had the desire and imagination to do so, about the details of that encounter. For a good year now, however, the occasional condom had turned into an ocean, a carpet of condoms, ever since a certain minister with a dark, taciturn face worthy of a Lombroso diagram had fished deep into his mind, which was even darker and more mysterious than his face, and come up with an idea he thought would solve all the South's law-and-order problems. He had managed to sell this idea to a colleague of his who dealt with the army and who, for his part, looked as if he had walked right out of a Pinocchio illustration, and together the two had decided to send a number of detachments to Sicily for the purpose of "controlling the territory," to lighten the load of the carabinieri, local police, intelligence services, special operations teams, coast guard, the highway police, railway police and port police, the anti-Mafia, anti-terrorism, anti-drug, anti-theft and anti-kidnapping commissions, and others-here omitted for the sake of brevity-quite busy with other business. Thanks to the brilliant idea of these two eminent statesmen, all the Piedmontese mama's boys and beardless Friulian conscripts who just the night before had enjoyed the crisp, fresh air of their mountains suddenly found themselves painfully short of breath, huffing in their temporary lodgings, in towns that stood barely a yard above sea level, among people who spoke an incomprehensible dialect consisting not so much of words as of silences, indecipherable movements of the eyebrows, imperceptible puckerings of the facial wrinkles. They adapted as best they could, thanks to their young age, and were given a helping hand by the residents of Vig&amp;aagrave;ta themselves, who were moved to pity by the foreign boys' lost, bewildered looks. The one who saw to lessening the hardship of their exile was a certain Geg Gullotta, a fast thinker who until that moment had been forced to suppress his natural gifts as a pimp by dealing in light drugs. Having learned through channels both underhanded and ministerial of the soldiers' imminent arrival, Geg had had a flash of genius, and to put said flash to work for him he had promptly appealed to the beneficence of those in charge of such matters in order to obtain all the countless convoluted authorizations indispensable to his plan-those in charge being, that is, those who truly controlled the area and would never have dreamt of issuing officially stamped permits. Geg, in short, succeeded in opening a specialized market of fresh meat and many and sundry drugs, all light, at the Pasture. Most of the meat came from the former Eastern Bloc countries, now free at last of the Communist yoke which, as everyone knows, had denied all personal, human dignity; now, between the Pasture's bushes and sandy shore, come nightfall, that reconquered dignity shone again in all its magnificence. But there was also no lack of Third World women, transvestites, transsexuals, Neapolitan faggots, Brazilian viados-something for every taste, a feast, an embarrassment of riches. And business flourished, to the great satisfaction of the soldiers, Geg, and those who, for a proper cut of the proceeds, had granted Geg permission to operate. Pino and Saro headed toward their assigned work sector, each pushing his own cart. To get to the Pasture it took half an hour, if one was slow of foot as they were. The first fifteen minutes they spent without speaking, already sweaty and sticky. It was Saro who broke the silence.</p><p>"That Pecorilla is a bastard," he announced.</p><p>"A fucking bastard," clarified Pino.</p><p>Pecorilla was the foreman in charge of assigning the areas to be cleaned, and he nurtured an undisguised hatred for anyone with an education, having himself managed to finish middle school, at age forty, only thanks to Cusumano, who had a man-to-man talk with the teacher. Thus he manipulated things so that the hardest, most demeaning work always fell to the three university graduates in his charge. That same morning, in fact, he had assigned to Ciccu Loreto the stretch of wharf from which the mail boat sailed for the island of Lampedusa. Which meant that Ciccu, with his accounting degree, would be forced to account for the piles of trash that noisy mobs of tourists, many-tongued yet all sharing the same utter disregard for personal and public cleanliness, had left behind on Saturday and Sunday while waiting to embark. And no doubt Pino and Saro, after the soldiers' two days off duty, would find the Pasture one big glory hole.</p><p>When they reached the corner of Via Lincoln and Viale Kennedy (in Vig&amp;aagrave;ta there was even a Cortile Eisenhower and a Vicolo Roosevelt), Saro stopped.</p><p>"I'm going to run upstairs and see how the little guy's doing," he said to his friend. "Wait here. I'll only be a minute."</p><p>Without waiting for Pino's answer, he slipped into one of those midget high-rises that were not more than twelve stories high, having been built around the same time as the chemical works and having just as quickly fallen into ruin, when not abandoned altogether. For someone approaching from the sea, Vig&amp;aagrave;ta rose up like a parody of Manhattan, on a reduced scale. And this explained, perhaps, the names of some of its streets.</p><p>Nen, the little guy, was awake; he slept on and off some two hours a night, spending the rest of the time with eyes wide open, without ever crying. Who had ever seen a baby that didn't cry? Day after day he was consumed by an illness of unknown cause and cure. The doctors of Vig&amp;aagrave;ta couldn't figure it out; his parents would have to take him somewhere else, to some big-shot specialist, but they didn't have the money. Nen grew sullen as soon as his eyes met his father's, a wrinkle forming across his forehead. He couldn't talk, but had expressed himself quite clearly with that silent reproach of the person who had put him in these straits.</p><p>"He's doing a little better, the fever's going down," said Tana, Saro's wife, just to make him happy.</p><p>The clouds had scattered, and now the sun was blazing hot enough to shatter rocks. Saro had already emptied his cart a dozen times in the garbage bin that had appeared, thanks to private initiative, where the rear exit of the factory used to be, and his back felt broken. When he was a few steps from the path that ran along the enclosure wall and led to the provincial road, he saw something sparkle violently on the ground. He bent down to have a better look. It was a heart-shaped pendant, enormous, studded with little diamonds all around and with one great big diamond in the middle. The solid-gold chain was still attached, though broken in one spot. Saro's right hand shot out, grabbed the necklace, and stuffed it in his pocket. The hand seemed to have acted on its own, before his brain, still flabbergasted by the discovery, could tell it anything. Standing up again, drenched in sweat, he looked around but didn't see a living soul.</p><p>Pino, who had chosen to work the stretch of the Pasture nearest the beach, at one point spotted the nose of a car about twenty yards away, sticking out of some bushes a bit denser than the rest. Unsure, he stopped; it wasn't possible someone could still be around here at this hour, seven in the morning, screwing a whore. He began to approach cautiously, one step at a time, almost bent over, and when he'd reached the taillights he quickly stood straight up. Nothing happened, nobody shouted to fuck off, the car seemed vacant. Coming nearer, he finally made out the indistinct shape of a man, motionless, in the passenger seat, head thrown back. He seemed to be in a deep sleep. But by the look and the smell of it, Pino realized something was fishy. He turned around and called to Saro, who came running, out of breath, eyes bulging.</p><p>"What is it? What the hell do you want?"</p><p>Pino thought his friend's questions a bit aggressive but blamed it on the fact that he had run all that way.</p><p>"Get a load of this," he said.</p><p>Plucking up his courage, Pino went up to the driver's side and tried to open the door but couldn't: it was locked. With the help of Saro, who seemed to have calmed down, he tried to reach the other door, against which the man's body was partially leaning, but the car, a large green BMW, was too close to the shrub to allow anyone to approach from that side. Leaning forward, however, and getting scratched by the brambles, they managed to get a better look at the man's face. He was not sleeping; his eyes were wide open and motionless. The moment they realized that the man was dead, Pino and Saro froze in terror-not at the sight of death but because they recognized him.</p><p>"I feel like I'm taking a sauna," said Saro as he ran along the provincial road toward a telephone booth. "A blast of cold one minute, a blast of heat the next."</p><p>They had agreed on one thing since overcoming their paralysis upon recognizing the deceased: before alerting the police, they had to make another phone call. They knew Deputy Cusumano's number by heart, and Saro dialed it. But Pino didn't let the phone ring even once.</p><p>"Hang up, quick!" he said.</p><p>Saro obeyed automatically.</p><p>"You don't want to tell him?"</p><p>"Let's just think for a minute, let's think hard. This is very important. You know as well as I do that Cusumano is a puppet."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>"He's a puppet of Luparello, who is everything-or was everything. With Luparello dead, Cusumano's a nobody, a doormat."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"So nothing."</p><p>They turned back toward Vig&amp;aagrave;ta, but after a few steps Pino stopped Saro.</p><p>"Rizzo, the lawyer," he said.</p><p>"I'm not going to call that guy. He gives me the creeps. I don't even know him."</p><p>"I don't either, but I'm going to call him anyway."</p><p>Pino got the number from the operator. Though it was still only seven forty-five, Rizzo answered after the first ring.</p><p>"Mr. Rizzo?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Excuse me for bothering you at this hour, Mr. Rizzo, but . . . we found Mr. Luparello, you see, and . . . well, he looks dead."</p><p>There was a pause. Then Rizzo spoke.</p><p>"So why are you telling me this?"</p><p>Pino was stunned. He was ready for anything, except that bizarre response.</p><p>"But . . . aren't you his best friend? We thought it was only right-"</p><p>"I appreciate it. But you must do your duty first. Good day."</p><p>Saro had been listening to the conversation, his cheek pressed against Pino's. They looked at each other, nonplussed. Rizzo acted as if they'd told him they'd just found some nameless cadaver.</p><p>"Shit! He was his friend, wasn't he?" Saro burst out.</p><p>"What do we know? Maybe they had a fight," said Pino to reassure him.</p><p>"So what do we do now?"</p><p>"We go and do our duty, like the lawyer said," concluded Pino.</p><p>They headed toward town, to police headquarters. The thought of going to the carabinieri didn't even cross their minds, since they were under the command of a Milanese lieutenant. The Vig&#x2c6;ta police inspector, on the other hand, was from Catania, a certain Salvo Montalbano, who, when he wanted to get to the bottom of something, he did.</p></p><h2>Deceived (Star Wars: The Old Republic, Vol. 2)</h2><p>The second novel set in the Old Republic era and based on the massively multiplayer online game <i>Star Wars</i>�: The Old Republic&#x2122; ramps up the action and brings readers face-to-face for the first time with a Sith warrior to rival the most sinister of the Order&#x2019;s Dark Lords&#x2014;Darth Malgus, the mysterious, masked Sith of the wildly popular &#x201c;Deceived&#x201d; and &#x201c;Hope&#x201d; game trailers.<br> <br>Malgus brought down the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in a brutal assault that shocked the galaxy.

Friction turned the air to fire, and Zeerid watched the orange glow of the flames through the transparisteel of the freighter's cockpit.<br><br>He was gripping the stick too tightly, he realized, and relaxed.<br><br>He hated atmosphere entries, always had, the long forty-count when heat, speed, and ionized particles caused a temporary sensor blackout. He never knew what kind of sky he'd encounter when he came out of the dark. Back when he'd carted Havoc Squadron commandos in a Republic gully jumper, he and his fellow pilots had likened the blackout to diving blind off a seaside cliff.<br><br>You always hope to hit deep water, they'd say. But sooner or later the tide goes out and you go hard into rock.<br><br>Or hard into a blistering crossfire. Didn't matter, really. The effect would be the same.<br><br>"Coming out of the dark," he said as the flame diminished and the sky opened below.<br><br>No one acknowledged the words. He flew Fatman alone, worked alone. The only things he carted anymore were weapons for The Exchange. He had his reasons, but he tried hard not to think too hard about what he was doing.<br><br>He leveled the ship off, straightened, and ran a quick sweep of the surrounding sky. The sensors picked up nothing.<br><br>"Deep water and it feels fine," he said, smiling.<br><br>On most planets, the moment he cleared the atmosphere he'd have been busy dodging interdiction by the planetary government. But not on Ord Mantell. The planet was a hive of crime syndicates, mercenaries, bounty hunters, smugglers, weapons dealers, and spicerunners.<br><br>And those were just the people who ran the place.<br><br>Factional wars and assassinations occupied their attention, not governance, and certainly not law enforcement. The upper and lower latitudes of the planet in particular were sparsely settled and almost never patrolled, a literal no-being's-land. Zeerid would have been surprised if the government had survsats running orbits over the area.<br><br>And all that suited him fine.<br><br>Fatman broke through a thick pink blanket of clouds, and the brown, blue, and white of Ord Mantell's northern hemisphere filled out Zeerid's field of vision. Snow and ice peppered the canopy, frozen shrapnel, beating a steady rhythm on Fatman's hull. The setting sun suffused a large swath of the world with orange and red. The northern sea roiled below him, choppy and dark, the irregular white circles of breaking surf denoting the thousands of uncharted islands that poked through the water's surface. To the west, far in the distance, he could make out the hazy edge of a continent and the thin spine of snowcapped, cloud-topped mountains that ran along its north-south axis.<br><br>Motion drew his eye. A flock of leatherwings, too small to cause a sensor blip, flew two hundred meters to starboard and well below him, the tents of their huge, membranous wings flapping slowly in the freezing wind, the arc of the flock like a parenthesis. They were heading south for warmer air and paid him no heed as he flew over and past them, their dull, black eyes blinking against the snow and ice.<br><br>He pulled back on the ion engines and slowed still further. A yawn forced itself past his teeth. He sat up straight and tried to blink away the fatigue, but it was as stubborn as an angry bantha. He'd given the ship to the autopilot and dozed during the hyperspace run from Vulta, but that was all the rack he'd had in the last two standard days. It was catching up to him.<br><br>He scratched at the stubble of his beard, rubbed the back of his neck, and plugged the drop coordinates into the navicomp. The comp linked with one of Ord Mantell's unsecured geosyncsats and fed back the location and course to Fatman. Zeerid's HUD displayed it on the cockpit canopy. He eyed the location and put his finger on the destination.<br><br>"Some island no one has ever heard of, up here where no one ever goes. Sounds about right."<br><br>Zeerid turned the ship over to the autopilot, and it banked him toward the island.<br><br>His mind wandered as Fatman cut through the sky. The steady patter of ice and snow on the canopy sang him a lullaby. His thoughts drifted back through the clouds to the past, to the days before the accident, before he'd left the marines. Back then, he'd worn the uniform proudly and had still been able to look himself in the mirror--<br><br>He caught himself, caught the burgeoning self-pity, and stopped the thoughts cold. He knew where it would lead.<br><br>"Stow that, soldier," he said to himself.<br><br>He was what he was, and things were what they were.<br><br>"Focus on the work, Z-man."<br><br>He checked his location against the coordinates in the navicomp. Almost there.<br><br>"Gear up and get frosty," he said, echoing the words he used to say to his commandos. "Ninety seconds to the LZ."<br><br>He continued his ritual, checking the charge on his blasters, tightening the straps on his composite armor vest, getting his mind right.<br><br>Ahead, he saw the island where he would make the drop: ten square klicks of volcanic rock fringed with a bad haircut of waist-high scrub whipping in the wind. The place would probably be underwater and gone next year.<br><br>He angled lower, flew a wide circle, unable to see much detail due to the snow. He ran a scanner sweep, as always, and the chirp of his instrumentation surprised him. A ship was already on the island. He checked his wrist chrono and saw that he was a full twenty standard minutes early. He'd made this run three times and Arigo--he was sure the man's real name was not Arigo--had never before arrived early.<br><br>He descended to a few hundred meters to get a better look.<br><br>Arigo's freighter, the Doghouse, shaped not unlike the body of a legless beetle, sat in a clearing on the east side of the island. Its landing ramp was down and stuck out of its belly like a tongue. Halogens glared into the fading twilight and reflected off the falling snow, turning the flakes into glittering jewels. He saw three men lingering around the ramp, though he was too far away to notice any details other than their white winter parkas.<br><br>They spotted Fatman, and one waved a gloved hand.<br><br>Zeerid licked his lips and frowned.<br><br>Something felt off.<br><br>Flares went up from the freighter and burst in the air--green, red, red, green.<br><br>That was the correct sequence.<br><br>He circled one more time, staring down through the swirl of snow, but saw nothing to cause alarm, no other ships on the island or in the surrounding sea. He pushed aside his concern and chalked his feelings up to the usual tension caused by dealing with miscreants and criminals.<br><br>In any event, he could not afford to frak up a drop of several hundred million credits of hardware because he felt skittish. The ultimate buyer--whoever that was--would be unhappy, and The Exchange would take the lost profits from Zeerid in blood and broken bones, then tack it on to the debt he already owed them. He'd lost track of exactly how much that was, but knew it was at least two million credits on the note for Fatman plus almost half that again on advances for Arra's medical treatment, though he'd kept Arra's existence a secret and his handler thought the latter were for gambling losses.<br><br>"LZ is secure." He hoped saying it would make it so. "Going in."<br><br>The hum of the reverse thrusters and a swirl of blown snow presaged the thump of Fatman's touching down on the rock. He landed less than fifty meters from Arigo's ship.<br><br>For a moment he sat in the cockpit, perfectly still, staring at the falling snow, knowing there'd be another drop after this one, then another, then another, and he'd still owe The Exchange more than he'd ever be able to pay. He was on a treadmill with no idea how to get off.<br><br>Didn't matter, though. The point was to earn for Arra, maybe get her a hoverchair instead of that wheeled antique. Better yet, prostheses.<br><br>He blew out a breath, stood, and tried to find his calm as he threw on a winter parka and fingerless gloves. In the cargo hold, he had to pick his way though the maze of shipping containers. He avoided looking directly at the thick black lettering on their sides, though he knew it by heart, had seen such crates many times in his military career.<br><br>DANGER--MUNITIONS. FOR MILITARY USE ONLY. KEEP AWAY FROM INTENSE HEAT OR OTHER ENERGY SOURCES.<br><br>In the crates were upward of three hundred million credits' worth of crew-served laser cannons, MPAPPs, grenades, and enough ammunition to keep even the craziest fire team grinning and sinning for months.<br><br>Near the bay's landing ramp, he saw that three of the four securing straps had come loose from one of the crates of grenades. He was lucky the crate hadn't bounced around in transit. Maybe the straps had snapped when he set down on the island. He chose to believe that rather than admit to his own sloppiness.<br><br>He did not bother reattaching the straps. Arigo's men would have to undo them to unload anyway.<br><br>He loosened his blasters in their holsters and pushed the button to open the bay and lower the ramp. The door descended and snow and cold blew in, the tang of ocean salt. He stepped out into the wind. The light of the setting sun made him squint. He'd been in only artificial light for upward of twelve hours. His boots crunched on the snow-dusted black rock. His exhalations steamed away in the wind.<br><br>Two of the men from Arrigo's freighter detached themselves from their ship and met him halfway. Both were human and bearded. One had a patched eye and a scar like a lightning stroke down one cheek. Both wore blasters on their hips. Like Zeerid, both had the butt straps undone.<br><br>Recognizing neither of them rekindled Zeerid's earlier concerns. He had a mind for faces, and both of the men were strangers.<br><br>The drop was starting to taste sour.<br><br>"Where's Arigo?" Zeerid asked.<br><br>"Doin' what Arigo does," Scar said, and gestured vaguely. "Sent us instead. No worries, though, right?"<br><br>No Scar shifted on his feet, an...</p><h2>Adam Raccoon and the King&#39;s Big Dinner (Parables for Kids)</h2><p>Adam Raccoon invites those he thinks are the &#34;important&#34; animals to the king&#39;s dinner and ignores the &#34;unimportant&#34; ones, and then learns there is enough for everyone.</p><p>Glen Keane is the legendary Disney animator who created Ariel, The Beast, Pocahontas, Tarzan, Rapunzel and Aladdin. Adam Raccoon is his first Children's book series. <br>The Good News always makes for a great story, especially when it's told in a fresh, creative, and totally unique way - it's how I feel about every book in the series, The Adventures of Adam Raccoon. Boys and girls can't help but see themselves in the antics of little Adam, as well as in the many times he is miraculously redeemed from his errors. Best of all, they will relish in the clever and colorful drawings that convey action, wonder, sorrow and delight. Each of Adam's stories will be read again and again... the series is that good. I highly recommend The Adventures of Adam Raccoon to pre schoolers, young readers, teachers, parents, and, yes, even art students! --<br><b><i>Joni Eareckson Tada, Joni and Friends International Disability Center</i></b><br><br>I've been a great admirer of Glen Keane s work because of his amazing draftsmanship in all the characters he animated for Disney movies. His ability to bring imagination to life is breathtaking. Even more enjoyable than beholding and appreciating the believability in his drawings is when you add eternal value and principles that can be applied to our lives. That's exactly what Glen has accomplished in his Adventures of Adam Raccoon series! Every story entertains in a very dramatic storytelling style and also teaches every reader how simple rules based on the Book of Books can help shape character. I felt like a kid again reading these books, encouraged by the familiar Christian principles and eager to read each new adventure of the lovable Adam Raccoon. --<br><b><i>Sergio Cariello, Creator of the Action Bible</i></b><br><br>These stories tell the many adventures of a curious raccoon named Adam and a lion (Christ-figure) named King Aren. I got an email from the publisher who wanted to inform me that Keane's books are back in print! I was so excited. But my daughter was even more excited. When she walked in the room and saw them, she screamed, hugged the books, and exclaimed, 'I can read these to my kids now! I don't want my kids growing up without Adam Raccoon!' The books were a huge favorite for all my children. No kid should grow up without Adam Raccoon. --<br><b><i>Julie Roys, Author of Redeeming the Feminine Soul</i></b></p><h2>No Greater Love</h2><p>A collection of inspirational writings includes reflections on love, prayer, giving, service, poverty, forgiveness, and Jesus</p><p>If <i>No Greater Love</i> doesn't soften your heart, nothing will.

Reprint.</p><p>Readers familiar with immigration history as told in books like Roger Daniels's <i>Coming to America</i> will experience a sense of d�j� vu with <i>Harvest of Empire</i> by Juan Gonzalez. The immigrant experience is a constant in American life; although the tides ebb and flow, it seems that there always has been an immigrant presence in the United States. What's different today, of course, is where the immigrants are coming from: half are Latin American. <p> Gonzalez, a columnist for the New York <i>Daily News</i>, studies these latest arrivals in a book that combines history and journalism. He has a keen understanding of Hispanic diversity, focusing not just on "Hispanics" as a monolithic category but as a variety of people from many nations. The politics in <i>Harvest of Empire</i> are often tendentious: Gonzalez unfavorably compares U.S. border control efforts to building the Great Wall in China, demands an end to Puerto Rico's "colonial status," insists that Spanish become an official language actively encouraged in the public schools, and so on. His agenda will no doubt appeal to a certain kind of reader, but at the cost of alienating many others, including, probably, a majority of Hispanics living in the United States. For those looking for a left-leaning account of Hispanic immigration, however, this book succeeds as an ambitious survey. <i>--John J.

But it wasn&#x2019;t until she helped perform an actual abortion procedure that Abby fully realized what she&#x2019;d been a part of all those years. <br>In the pages of <i>Unplanned</i>, you&#x2019;ll also discover: <ul><li> What Abby found so attractive about the mission and goals of Planned Parenthood </li><li> The personal secret that Abby had kept buried for years</li><li> The things she&#x2019;d believed and told patients that she discovered not to be true </li><li> An insider&#x2019;s perspective on Planned Parenthood&#x2019;s practices as well as the heartfelt but misguided efforts of some radical antiabortion activists </li><li> The courage and resilience she&#x2019;s seen on both sides of the fence&#x2015;from staff members to clients in crisis to prayerful volunteers </li> </ul> A compelling story of crisis and change, <i>Unplanned</i> is also a reminder of how grace finds us in unlikely places, and how we can all reach out with love to those who stand on opposing sides. <br>Abby Johnson holds a B.S. in psychology from Texas A&amp;M University and an M.A. in counseling from Sam Houston State University. She was hired by Planned Parenthood in 2005 and progressed to the position of community services director and health educator, where she served as liaison between the community and Planned Parenthood as media correspondent.

Unknown to me, Ada was raised in the shadow of a famous father, as the only legitimate daughter of poet Lord Byron. We soon learn the eccentric Byron abandons his new family a month after Ada&#x2019;s birth, never to see either his child or wife again. Ada&#x2019;s mother becomes obsessed with purging all things creative and imaginative from Ada&#x2019;s upbringing, in the hopes of saving her child from the same perceived mania that plagued her poet husband. With an ever-changing cast of tutors and governesses, and forbidden from most artistic outlets, Ada throws herself headfirst into academia and mathematics. Chiaverini expertly illuminates the adversities Ada faced in melding her analytical prowess with the creative thought she was told for so long to suppress. While Ada was largely unrecognized for her accomplishments while alive, this novel is a generous ode to one of history&#x2019;s most extraordinary female trailblazers. <em>--Sydney Dale</em><b>Jennifer Chiaverini</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Lincoln's&nbsp;Dressmaker</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fates and Traitors</i>, and other acclaimed works of historical fiction, as&nbsp;well as the beloved Elm Creek Quilts series.

Leo would spend the next five years in a coke processing plant, shoveling coal, lugging bricks, mixing mortar, and battling the relentless calculus of hunger that governed the labor colony: one shovel load of coal is worth one gram of bread.</p><p>In her new novel, Nobel laureate Herta M�ller calls upon her unique combination of poetic intensity and dispassionate precision to conjure the distorted world of the labor camp in all its physical and moral absurdity. She has given Leo the language to express the inexpressible, as hunger sharpens his senses into an acuity that is both hallucinatory and profound. In scene after disorienting scene, the most ordinary objects accrue tender poignancy as they acquire new purpose&#x2015;a gramophone box serves as a suitcase, a handkerchief becomes a talisman, an enormous piece of casing pipe functions as a lovers' trysting place. The heart is reduced to a pump, the breath mechanized to the rhythm of a swinging shovel, and coal, sand, and snow have a will of their own. Hunger becomes an insatiable angel who haunts the camp, but also a bare-knuckled sparring partner, delivering blows that keep Leo feeling the rawest connection to life.</p><p>M�ller has distilled Leo's struggle into words of breathtaking intensity that take us on a journey far beyond the Gulag and into the depths of one man's soul.</p></p><p><b>Herta M�ller</b> is the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature, as well as the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and the European Literature Prize. She is the author of, among other books, <i>The Land of Green Plums</i> and <i>The Appointment</i>. Born in Romania in 1953, M�ller lost her job as a teacher and suffered repeated threats after refusing to cooperate with Ceausescu's secret police. She succeeded in emigrating in 1987 and now lives in Berlin.<b>On packing suitcases</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>All that I have I carry on me.<br>Or: All that is mine I carry with me.<br>I carried all I had, but it wasn&#x2019;t mine. Everything either came from someone else or wasn&#x2019;t what it was supposed to be. A gramophone box served as a pigskin suitcase. The light overcoat came from my father. The fancy coat with the velvet collar from my grandfather. The knickers from Uncle Edwin. The leather gaiters came from our neighbor Herr Carp, the green woolen gloves from Aunt Fini. Only the burgundy silk scarf and the toilet kit belonged to me, presents from the previous Christmas.<br>The war was still on in January 1945. In their dismay at my being shipped off in the dead of winter to who knows where in Russia, everyone wanted to give me something that might be of use, even if it couldn&#x2019;t help. Because nothing in the world could possibly help: I was on the Russians&#x2019; list, and that was that. So everyone gave me something, and kept their thoughts to themselves. And I took what they gave. I was seventeen years old, and in my mind this going away couldn&#x2019;t have come at a better time. Not that I needed the Russians&#x2019; list, but if things didn&#x2019;t turn out too badly, I thought, this leaving might even be a good thing. I wanted to get out of our thimble of a town, where every stone had eyes. Instead of fear I felt a secret impatience. And I had a bad conscience about it, because the same list that caused my relatives such despair was fine with me. They were afraid something might happen to me in a foreign country. I simply wanted to go to a place that didn&#x2019;t know who I was.<br>Something had just happened to me. Something forbidden. Something strange, filthy, shameless, and beautiful. It happened in the Alder Park, far in the back, on the other side of the short-grass mounds. Afterward, on my way home, I went to the pavilion in the middle of the park where the bands played on holidays. I sat there a while. Sunlight came stabbing through the finely carved wood. I stared at the empty circles, squares, and trapezoids, held together by white tendrils with claws, and I saw their fear. This was the pattern of my aberration, of the horror on my mother&#x2019;s face. In the pavilion I vowed: I&#x2019;m never coming back to this park.<br>But the more I tried to stop myself, the faster I went back&#x2014;after two days. For a rendezvous, as it was known in the park.<br>That next rendezvous was with the same first man. He was called THE SWALLOW. The second man was new, his name was THE FIR. The third was THE EAR. Then came THE THREAD. Then ORIOLE and CAP. Later HARE, CAT, GULL. Then THE PEARL. Only we knew which name belonged to whom. The park was a wild animal crossing, I let myself be passed from one man to the next. And it was summer with white skin on birch trees and shrubs of elderberry and mock orange leafing out to form an impenetrable wall of green.<br>Love has its seasons. Autumn brought an end to the park. The trees grew naked, and we moved our rendezvous to the Neptune Baths. An oval sign with a swan hung next to the iron gate. Every week I met up with a married man twice my age. He was Romanian. I won&#x2019;t say what name he used or what name I used. We staggered our arrivals, so that no one and nothing could have any idea that we&#x2019;d arranged to meet: not the cashier ensconced in the leaded-glass windows of her booth, nor the shiny stone floor, nor the rounded middle column, nor the water-lily tiles on the wall, nor the carved wooden stairs. We swam in the pool with all the others and didn&#x2019;t come together until we were both in the sauna.<br>Back then, before my time in the camp as well as after I returned, and all the way up to 1968 when I left the country, every rendezvous could have landed me in prison. Minimum five years, if I&#x2019;d been caught. Some were. They went straight from the park or the baths to a brutal interrogation and then to jail. And from there to the penal colony on the canal. Today I know that almost nobody came back from there. The ones who did were walking corpses&#x2014;old before their time and broken, of no use for any love in the world.<br>And in the camp&#x2014;if I&#x2019;d been caught in the camp I&#x2019;d be dead.<br>After those five camp years I roamed the busy streets, day in and day out, silently rehearsing what to say in case I was arrested, preparing a thousand excuses and alibis to counter the verdict: CAUGHT IN THE ACT. I carry silent baggage. I have packed myself into silence so deeply and for so long that I can never unpack myself using words. When I speak, I only pack myself a little differently.<br>Once during the last rendezvous-summer I took a long way home from the park and found myself near the Holy Trinity Church on the main square. This chance detour turned out to be significant: I saw the time that was coming. On a column next to the side-altar stood a saint in a gray cloak, with a sheep draped around his neck as a collar. This sheep draped around the neck is silence. There are things we do not speak of. But I know what I&#x2019;m talking about when I say that silence around the neck is different from silence inside the mouth. Before, during, and after my time in the camp, for twenty-five years, I lived in fear&#x2014;of my family and of the state. Fear of a double disgrace: that the state would lock me away as a criminal and that my family would disown me out of shame. On crowded streets I would stare at the glass panes of the shops, at the windows of streetcars, of houses, I would gaze into fountains and puddles&#x2014;checking to make sure I wasn&#x2019;t transparent after all.<br>My father was an art teacher. With the Neptune Baths inside my head, whenever he used the word WATERCOLOR I&#x2019;d flinch as though he&#x2019;d kicked me. The words knew how far I&#x2019;d already gone. At the dinner table my mother said: Don&#x2019;t stab the potato with your fork because it will fall apart, use your spoon, the fork is for meat. My temples were throbbing. Why is she saying meat when she&#x2019;s talking about forks and potatoes. What kind of meat does she mean. I was my own thief, the words came out of nowhere and caught me.<br>Like all the Germans in our little town, my mother, and especially my father, believed in the beauty of blond braids and white knee-stockings. They believed in the black square of Hitler&#x2019;s mustache and in the Aryan heritage of us Transylvanian Saxons. The physical part of my secret alone was a gross abomination. And with a Romanian there was the additional matter of <i>Rassenschande</i>.<br>I wanted to escape from my family, to a camp if need be. But I felt sorry for my mother, who had no idea how little she knew me. And who would think of me more frequently when I was away than I of her.<br>Inside the church, next to the saint with the sheep of silence, I had seen the white alcove with the inscription: HEAVEN SETS TIME IN MOTION. Packing my suitcase, I thought: The white alcove has done its work. This is the time that&#x2019;s been set in motion. I was also happy I wasn&#x2019;t being sent off to war, into the snow at the front. Foolishly brave and obedient, I went on packing. And I took whatever was offered&#x2014;leather gaiters with laces, knickers, the coat with the velvet collar&#x2014;even though none of it was really right for me. Because this wasn&#x2019;t about clothes, but about the time that had been set in motion, about growing up, with one set of things or another. The world is not a costume ball, I thought, and no one who&#x2019;s forced to go to Russia in the dead of winter need worry about looking ridiculous.<br>A patrol consisting of two policemen&#x2014;a Romanian and a Russian&#x2014;went from house to house carrying a list. I no longer remember whether the word CAMP was uttered inside our home. Or what other word might have been spoken, except RUSSIA. If the word CAMP was mentioned, it didn&#x2019;t frighten me. Despite the war and the silence about my rendezvous draped around my neck, I was only seventeen years old and still living in my bright, silly childhood. The words WATERCOLOR and MEAT affected me. My brain didn&#x2019;t register the word CAMP.<br>Back then, at the table with the fork and potatoes, when my mother caught me with the word meat, I remembered how she used to shout down to the courtyard where I was playing: If you don&#x2019;t come to dinner right away, if I have to call you one more time, you can just stay where you are. But I didn&#x2019;t always come right away, and once, when I finally went upstairs, she said:<br>Why don&#x2019;t you just pack your satchel and go out into the world and do whatever you want. She pulled me into my room, grabbed my woolen cap and my jacket, and stuffed them inside my little backpack. I said, But I&#x2019;m your child, where am I supposed to go.<br>A lot of people think packing a suitcase is something you learn through practice, like singing or praying. We had no practice and no suitcase. When my father was sent to join the Romanian soldiers on the front, there was nothing to pack. Soldiers are given everything they need, it&#x2019;s all part of the uniform. But we had no idea what we were packing for, except a long journey and a cold place. If you don&#x2019;t have the right things, you improvise. The wrong things become necessary. Then the necessary things turn out to be the only right things, simply because they&#x2019;re what you have.<br>My mother brought the gramophone from the living room and set it on the kitchen table. Using a screwdriver, I made it into a suitcase. First I took out the spindle and turntable. Then I corked up the hole for the crank. The fox-red velvet lining stayed. I also kept the triangular emblem with HIS MASTER&#x2019;S VOICE and the dog facing the horn. I put four books on the bottom: a cloth-bound edition of <i>Faust</i>, the slim volume of Weinheber, <i>Zarathustra</i>, and my anthology of poems from eight centuries. No novels, since you just read them once and never again. After the books came my toilet kit, containing: 1 bottle eau de toilette, 1 bottle Tarr aftershave, 1 shaving soap, 1 razor, 1 shaving ...</p><h2>White Women</h2><p>White Women, Helmut Newton&#39;s legendary first work, appeared more than twenty years ago. With its superior mixture of aesthetics, technical perfection and bourgeois decadence it has lost nothing of its potency and attractiveness. Newton&#39;s work encompasses a wealth of themes, also embodying facets of the mass-media world of glamour, masquerade and show. Using subtle, yet striking images--like those of Paloma Picasso, Veruschka, Elsa Peretti, Karl Lagerfeld, David Hockney, and Charlotte Rampling--Newton embraces the delicate, natural beauty of the naked female body. White Women is a masterpiece of erotic visual literature.</p><p>White Women was and still is the legendary first book by Helmut Newton, published in 1976. His inimitable blend of aestheticism, technical perfection and luxurious upper-middle-class decadence is today just as appealing and controversial as it was thirty-three years ago.

Working with acclaimed writer Anthony Walton, Abdul-Jabbar interviewed the surviving members of the battalion and their descendants to weave together a page-turning narrative based on their memories and stories, from basic training through the horrors on the battlefield to their postwar experiences in a racially divided America.<br><br>Trained essentially as a public relations gesture to maintain the support of the black community for the war, the battalion was never intended to see battle. In fact, General Patton originally opposed their deployment, claiming African Americans couldn&#x2019;t think quickly enough to operate tanks in combat conditions. But the Allies were so desperate for trained tank personnel in the summer of 1944, following heavy casualties in the fields of France, that the battalion was called up.<br><br>While most combat troops fought on the front for a week or two before being rotated back, the men of the 761st served for more than six months, fighting heroically under Patton&#x2019;s Third Army at the Battle of the Bulge and in the Allies&#x2019; final drive across France and Germany. Despite a casualty rate that approached 50 percent and an extreme shortage of personnel and equipment, the 761st would ultimately help liberate some thirty towns and villages, as well as the Gunskirchen Lager concentration camp. <br><br>The racism that shadowed them during the war and the prejudice they faced upon their return home is an indelible part of their story.

I wanted to do my part.</i><br>--William McBurney<br>When seventeen-year-old Leonard Smith stepped off the United States Army troop train in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, in the fall of 1942, it was the first time he had been outside of New York State. For the last three days, he had been traveling with fourteen other recruits, headed to Camp Claiborne, seventeen miles southwest of Alexandria. There, they were to join a recently established armored unit. To Smith's surprise, the train stopped in an open field. The sergeants on the train threw the young soldiers' bags out and told them to get off. Smith and his companions, in full dress uniform and carrying their regulation duffel bags, waited for four hours in the empty field on the outskirts of the Kisatchie National Forest, watching the sun move across the sky. Finally, two of them set off on foot to find help.<br><br>Leonard Smith was one of the more than six hundred men who would come together at Camp Claiborne during the Second World War to form the 761st Tank Battalion. They would hail from over thirty states, from small towns and cities scattered throughout the country, from places as varied as Los Angeles, California, and Holtulka, Oklahoma; Springfield, Illinois, and Picayune, Mississippi; Billings, Montana, and Baltimore, Maryland. Most had volunteered. Some were the middle-class sons of doctors, undertakers, schoolteachers, and career military men; among the officers were a Yale student and a football star from UCLA who would later make his mark in American sports and American history. Many more were the sons of janitors, domestics, factory workers, and sharecroppers. <br><br>Their combat record in Europe during the war was noteworthy. They were to earn a Presidential Unit Citation for distinguished service, more than 250 Purple Hearts, 70 Bronze Stars, 11 Silver Stars, and a Congressional Medal of Honor in 183 straight days on the front lines of France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, and Austria. These accomplishments carried a significance, however, beyond the battlefield. The unit's official designation was "The 761st Tank Battalion (Colored)." As they waited in that hot Louisiana field, Leonard Smith and his fellow recruits were on their way to becoming part of the first African American unit in the history of the United States Army to fight in tanks.<br>In the fall of 1942, the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific seemed far from the backwater post of Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. They were as far from Leonard Smith's experience as Camp Claiborne had been before he boarded the train in New York City. Smith was born in Harlem Hospital on November 2, 1924; he was a sickly child at birth, weighing less than five pounds, with both colic and a heart murmur. His mother abandoned him shortly after he was born. Lulu Hasbruck, who worked for New York City taking in children with medical complications, cared for Smith during those early, precarious years. Other foster children regularly moved in and out of Hasbruck's home, but Smith and two girls, Thelma and Flora, remained. Smith would come to regard Lulu as his mother, though she never formally adopted him. <br><br>Despite his short, skinny frame and the heart murmur that kept him from playing school sports, Smith became an active, adventuresome child, regularly challenging other kids in his Brooklyn, and later Queens, neighborhood to footraces around the block. The neighborhood kids didn't seem to mind losing to him. There was something about him that adults and classmates immediately responded to, a combination of good-naturedness, irrepressibility, and naivete that made him impossible to dislike. <br><br>He loved singing, and was good enough even at age eight to solo with the senior choir at local churches. But his obsession was airplanes. A favorite teacher rewarded students for exceptional performance by buying them a toy of their choice from the neighborhood five-and-dime. Smith hated arithmetic, but he worked hard to get high marks so that she would have to buy him a toy. He invariably picked out model planes, pictures of planes, and books about planes. Though he had never seen an airplane up close, there was something about the idea of planes and flying, the freedom of movement flying symbolized, that endlessly fired his high-spirited imagination.<br><br>Money was scarce. Clothes for foster children were provided by the city, a source of some discomfort for the children: People knew they were "home" children, wards of the city, because of the way they dressed. But the only thing Smith really missed was not having a father. When other kids in the neighborhood would talk about things they'd done with their fathers, he would make up stories about fishing trips and family outings. When asked why his father wasn't around, he would tell his friends his father was traveling on business. He made an imaginary father out of Mrs. Hasbruck's deceased husband, George, collecting countless details about him: Mrs. Hasbruck told him that George had smoked a pipe with Prince Albert tobacco, and Smith vowed that when he grew up he'd do the same. Mrs. Hasbruck's two brothers gave Smith spending money from time to time, but they rarely provided him with fatherly guidance. He had to learn everything for himself, and he often made mistakes.<br><br>One such mistake contributed to his decision to enlist in the Army. As a teenager, he had enrolled at Chelsea Vocational High School to study aviation mechanics. There he fell in with a group of older boys, budding delinquents who played hooky every Friday, shoplifting tools from local stores. It was typical of the guileless Smith that he continued going to class long after the boys he hung out with had stopped. It was also typical that while Smith's adventuresome ness led him to skirt the edges of disaster, his good-naturedness and good luck just as often kept him out. A neighborhood cop who knew and liked Smith pulled him aside, telling him that the boys he was running around with were going to wind up in prison one way or another. "Have you ever considered joining the Army?" he asked.<br><br>Smith had considered it--it was May 1942, and the United States had been at war for six months--but at seventeen, he had thought he was too young to enlist. American troops were already engaging in bloody combat in the Pacific, surrendering after a hopelessly one-sided struggle in the Philippines on May 6, but stalling the advance of the Japanese two days later in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Like millions of families across the country, the Hasbrucks listened to the radio every night for war updates. When he went to the local cinema, Smith avidly watched the early newsreels of combat. He knew exactly what he wanted to enlist as: a fighter pilot. He imagined himself streaking through the skies, on the lookout for Japanese Zeros, engaging in dogfights, dropping bombs on enemy aircraft carriers. In Smith's young mind, war was a kind of game. He had no concept of war's brutality, and he was eager to join the fight. At the policeman's suggestion, he went to the induction office on Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan carrying a permission form signed by his foster mother.<br><br>The doctor administering the Army physical failed to notice his slight heart murmur, and passed him. Smith told the recruiter who processed his application that he wanted to be a pilot. The sergeant told him that was not possible--the Army Air Corps did not accept blacks. Smith barely managed to swallow his disappointment. Citing his training in high school, he then said he wanted to be an aviation mechanic. Again, he was told that was not possible. The Army's rigid color line took Smith by surprise. Growing up in the New York City of the 1920s and '30s, he had encountered his share of discrimination: There were certain neighborhood pools where he was not permitted to go swimming, and certain stores where the entrance of anybody black was announced by ringing bells to rouse white clerks to extra vigilance. But despite such small daily indignities, it had somehow never occurred to him that the color of his skin would impact his future, his lifelong dream of working with planes.<br><br>He had scored high marks on the Army's IQ screening test. "Infantry you definitely don't want," the sergeant advised him. The next-best thing to the air force was armored, the sergeant said. "Armored?" Smith asked. The sergeant replied, "Tanks. They're starting a couple of colored tank battalions. How would you like that?" Smith had never seen a tank--in fact, he had no idea what a tank was. But he was game for anything. The sergeant told him that as a volunteer, "if that's what you want, that's where you're going to go."<br>William McBurney was as reserved and cautious as Leonard Smith was naive and adventuresome. Although the two men didn't know each other, McBurney took the subway to the induction office just days after Smith. His motives in doing so were mixed. Like Smith, he had watched the news updates of the war: A wave of patriotism had swept the country in the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and thousands of young men across the country enlisted every day. McBurney was eager to do his part for the war effort. But he also saw the Army as an escape.<br><br>McBurney was born in Harlem on May 21, 1924. His parents divorced when he was very young; his mother moved away to Florida, and he saw her only rarely after that. He was raised by his father and stepmother. When he was twelve years old, his younger brother died of scarlet fever. Though devastated by the loss, McBurney did what he had watched his father do all his life: bury the pain deep inside, and keep moving. <br><br>William had always been in awe of his father. A smart, determined, and ambitious man, his father had been born dirt poor around the turn of the century in Titusville, Florida. Seeing no prospects for advancement there, he had worked his way north to New Yo...</p><h2>Captain Underpants and the Big, Bad Battle of the Bionic Booger Boy, Part 1: The Night of the Nasty Nostril Nuggets (Captain Underpants #6) (6)</h2><p>George and Harold are up to their old tricks again, and when their latest prank makes a direct hit on school brainiac Melvin Sneedly, he decides to get even! But in the blink of an eye -- and the sneeze of a nose -- Melvin goes from snooty to snotty, and the Bionic Booger Boy is born! Can Captain Underpants clean up this catastrophe, or will the mucous monster make a mess of things?</p><p>The sixth "epic novel" in Dav Pilkey's hugely popular series explains the awful truth about Captain Underpants (he is really the school principal), details "the night of the nasty nostril nuggets," offers up "the unnecessarily disgusting chapter," and even explains how "you can't have your cape and Edith, too." <p> George and Harold are "C" students (and bad spellers), but they are very good at "saving the entire planet from the nasty forces of unrelenting evil" and also at ketchup-toilet pranks. Unfortunately, they can't save Melvin Sneedly from getting paddled by his bionic hamster. But, frankly, they wouldn't want to, because besides being the school brainiac, Melvin is also a tattletale. When his robot-making hobby backfires horribly, Melvin transforms himself into the Bionic Booger Boy instead of a bionic superboy. Can Captain Underpants save everyone from this "greenish, glistening behemoth?"</p><p> Pilkey is the superhero of boy humor, stuffing his heavily illustrated books with comic-book inserts, "flip-o-rama" animation, and all the gross-out jokes an elementary-school kid could stomach.

In some ways, the media frenzy over the rating overshadowed the harrowing portrait of teenagers destroying their lives and the then twenty-one-year-old screenwriter who created them. "Whether you see the movie as a masterpiece or as sensationalism," wrote Lynn Hirshberg, "the movie is relentless and brilliant and extremely disturbing. It's powerful-both steel-eyed and sexy; horrifying and captivating."<br>Now, in this first book of fictional set pieces, Korine captures the fragmented moments of a life observed through the demented lens of media, TV, and teen obsession. Korine reinvents the novel in this highly experimental montage of scenes that seem both real and surreal at the same time. With a filmmaker's eye and a prankster's glee, this bizarre collection of jokes, half-remembered scenes, dialogue fragments, movie ideas, and suicide notes is an episodic, epigrammatic lovesong to the world of images. Korine is the voice of his media-savvy generation and <i>A Crack-Up at the Race Riots</i> is the satiric lovechild of his dark imagination.</p><p><b>Harmony Korine</b> is the director of the films <i>Gummo, Julien Donkey-Boy, Mister Lonely, Spring Breakers, </i>and <i>Trash Humpers,</i> as well as music videos for artists such as Cat Power, Sonic Youth, and Will Oldham. He was&nbsp;the writer of the film <i>Kids</i>. He lives in Nashville, Tennessee.Riding a gush of critical acclaim for his work on the films Kids (screenwriter) and Gummo (director), Korine, at the ripe age of 23, attempts to make a novel by using a little bit of everything, but botches the job. What we get, in fact, is more an MTV-style collage of lists, story fragments, indecipherable handwritten notes, crude drawings, photos, dialogue, bad jokes, wordplay and pop culture references to music, movies, drugs and deathall resolutely defying cohesion. Still, there a few identifiable thematic concerns. Suicide tops the list, as frequent references culminate in a group of 11 suicide notes, the last of which begins, ``Mother, I am in love with you.'' Not far behind is a focus on the celebrity life, and in this vein Korine demonstrates a certain breadth of knowledge and interest. A scandal involving silent movie star Fatty Arbuckle is given almost as much attention as the final thoughts of Tupac Shakur, and in between are snippets about Kris Kristofferson, Billie Jean King, Howard Hughes, Matt Dillon, and a cavalcade of others. Jessica Tandy earns especially randy attention (although the motivation behind this is never revealed), and sexual detail pops up in other ways as well, ranging from the incest angle to homophobes planning action. The racial component noted in the title features in a suicide note, and separate photos of the KKK and an unsmiling black boy round out the picture. A final observation notes that ``To feel nothing was peace''perfectly describing the impact of everything in the preceding pages. Neither the voice of a generation nor the ravings of a lunatic, but creative overreaching, clearlythe writing of a talent thrust too soon into the limelight.

This collection of poetry by the creator of Winnie the Pooh was first published in 1924. With its companion volume <i>Now We Are Six,</i> the little books became two of the biggest bestsellers in publishing history. Children all over the world have heard about changing the guard at Buckingham Palace; James James Morrison Morrison Weather by George Dupree; the three little foxes who kept their handkerchiefs in cardboard boxes; and, of course, Christopher Robin, named for A.A. Milne's son. Adults and older children will enjoy Milne's poems too, as some of his humor is subtly directed at a more sophisticated audience. But younger children are the ones who love the naughty Mary Jane (lovely rice pudding again?) and the bears on the corners of London's streets. Read these poems aloud and pass along (or start) a family tradition. <i>(Ages 5 to 9)</i><i>When We Were Very Young</i>, the first of A.A.

What should he say? He had been dreading this moment all day. The trial was going badly and Daniel was hardly a year qualified to practice law, let alone to defend a man on trial for his life.<br><br>But how could he have refused? Daniel&#x2019;s father, Sir Thomas Pitt, had asked the head of the law firm if he would allow Daniel to take the case. Blackwell was a private inquiry agent and something of an adventurer. Perhaps some of his cases were dubious, his clients not the most obviously innocent.<br><br>Blackwell had been a policeman at the time when Pitt was at Bow Street, long before Pitt had joined Special Branch. He had liked Blackwell, understood not only his sense of humor, but his individual morality. Pitt had saved Blackwell more than once from the consequences of his more quixotic and irregular actions. Blackwell had, on occasion, saved Pitt, too. But the time finally came when Pitt begged Blackwell to leave the police, before he made a mistake from which he could not escape. Reluctantly, Blackwell had taken his advice.<br><br>Pitt had never forgotten their friendship, and now that Blackwell had fallen seriously afoul of the law, the best Pitt could do for him was to ask Daniel to represent him in court.<br><br>Daniel could not refuse. He, too, liked Blackwell, probably for all the same reasons that his father did: his wry humor, his optimism and his imagination.<br><br>Daniel frankly found the law far more tedious than he had expected to. The study of it had been interesting at university, but the actuality involved mountains of detailed paperwork. There was nothing glamorous in it, none of the crusading activity he had hoped for.<br><br>He was a novice, feeling his inexperience with some pain. He was up against Douglas Sefton, who was skilled, articulate and determined at this, his fifth attempt to finally convict Roman Blackwell for something&#x2014;�this time for murder.<br><br>Blackwell was watching Daniel, waiting for him to answer. He would recognize a lie if he heard one. And what was the use of Daniel lying anyway? Blackwell would only resent it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, they will hang you,&#x201d; Daniel replied very quietly. &#x201c;Which is why we have to prove you did not kill John Hinton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reasonable doubt?&#x201d; Blackwell tried to put hope in his voice, but for once the charm and the music in it did not work.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re beyond reasonable,&#x201d; Daniel answered as gently as he could. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll need very strong doubt indeed, and someone the jury can believe is guilty, if you aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not!&#x201d; Blackwell&#x2019;s voice cracked. The desperation was there for only an instant, but it was unmistakable. &#x201c;I never even touched the gun!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Neither did anyone else, according to the fingerprints&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What fingerprints?&#x201d; Blackwell heatedly demanded. &#x201c;There were none!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somebody fired it,&#x201d; Daniel pointed out.<br><br>&#x201c;Gloves on?&#x201d; Blackwell asked with sudden light in his face. &#x201c;That means somebody who knew about fingerprints, knew that everyone&#x2019;s are different!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Chinese have known about them for centuries,&#x201d; Daniel told him. It was a piece of information he found particularly interesting. It was just five years ago, actually&#x2014;�in 1905&#x2014;�that fingerprints had first been used to identify two murderers and convict them in a British court.<br><br>&#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t kill him, someone else did. There&#x2019;s no question Hinton was shot&#x2014;�deliberately. And unfortunately, there is no doubt that you knew him well, and quarreled over a debt&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only a few pounds!&#x201d; Blackwell said indignantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to kill a man over a few quid!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Park says it was four hundred,&#x201d; Daniel pointed out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So it is,&#x201d; Blackwell agreed. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m going to lend that much to a chancer like Hinton? I&#x2019;m not a complete fool!&#x201d;<br><br>Daniel smiled bleakly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re generous occasionally, Roman. And&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not that generous!&#x201d; Blackwell said incredulously.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;�known to drink a little too freely, and then forget what you&#x2019;ve done?&#x201d; Daniel finished.<br><br>&#x201c;I never forget money,&#x201d; Blackwell said fiercely. &#x201c;Not that much!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not even when you are&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; he hesitated, then went on, &#x201c;. . . thoroughly drunk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t even if I wished to.&#x201d; Blackwell shook his head. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got that much&nbsp;. . . at least I hadn&#x2019;t then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you prove that?&#x201d; Daniel knew there was no way he could.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t kill him,&#x201d; Blackwell repeated desperately. His face puckered at the unreasonableness of it. &#x201c;Why would I lend that kind of money to a lowdown article like Hinton? It makes no sense.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll say you were drunk at the time,&#x201d; Daniel replied reasonably. &#x201c;Look, Roman, there&#x2019;s no point in arguing something we can&#x2019;t prove.&#x201d; He leaned forward a little over the table between them. &#x201c;The only way to change the jury&#x2019;s minds is to make them seriously consider somebody else. If Hinton was not as useless as the prosecution says, he will have had other enemies. Think carefully. Who were they, and why? Think of people he cheated, lied to or lied about. People he got into trouble. People he could have been a witness against.&#x201d;<br><br>Blackwell thought hard. He was a big man, not tall, but broad and strong, with a shock of jet-�black hair. Only lately, he seemed to have shrunk into himself, as if he were retreating without actually moving from the hard wooden chair.<br><br>Daniel searched for something to encourage Blackwell with, not only for kindness&#x2019; sake, but also because Blackwell was the only source of information that could implicate anyone else, or at least provide Daniel with another course to follow.<br><br>Blackwell looked up hopelessly.<br><br>Oscar Park was the main witness against Blackwell, and Daniel had not made a dent in his testimony yet. He felt he was clutching at straws. &#x201c;Well then, what can we find out about Park to make the jury doubt him? Hinton owed you money; he&#x2019;s no use to you dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no use alive either,&#x201d; Blackwell said with a wry smile. &#x201c;Do you think that counts?&#x201d;<br><br>Daniel was too desperate to return the smile. &#x201c;If Park is lying on the witness stand, why? It&#x2019;s a big risk he&#x2019;s taking. There must be a reason, and we&#x2019;ve got to find it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Blackwell said wearily. &#x201c;I never did him any harm.&#x201d;<br><br>Daniel leaned forward a little farther. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have to be as direct as that. Come on! You&#x2019;ve got enough imagination to see the oblique. What do we know as fact? You didn&#x2019;t lend Hinton four hundred pounds, whether he paid it back or not. And how would Park know anyway? That&#x2019;s the price of a small house. Did he owe that money to Park?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe. Park was tight,&#x201d; Blackwell responded. &#x201c;I once lent him fifty pounds, and he never paid me back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That could be something. I wonder if he owed anyone else? Who else can I call? I&#x2019;ve got to have something to build on!&#x201d; He heard the sharpness in his own voice. He must control it.<br><br>Blackwell said nothing.<br><br>Daniel racked his mind for anything that made sense. &#x201c;Then revenge? Does Park hate you? Have you done something to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but I&#x2019;d like to,&#x201d; Blackwell replied with feeling. &#x201c;The bastard. After the money I&#x2019;ve lent him.&#x201d; His expression was screwed up with the injustice of it.<br><br>But Daniel was concentrating on the evidence. He reached across the table and gripped Blackwell&#x2019;s wrist. &#x201c;He owes you money and he&#x2019;s repaying you like this? It&#x2019;s more than ingratitude, Roman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t only the money,&#x201d; Blackwell said quickly, shaking his head a little.<br><br>&#x201c;But it was something?&#x201d; Daniel insisted.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t mention it in court,&#x201d; Blackwell said with a flash of self-�mockery. &#x201c;It was just a little against the law. Fine line, but the wrong side of it&#x2014;�definitely. If it comes out they&#x2019;ll can me for that, too, while they&#x2019;ve got the chance.&#x201d;<br><br>Daniel wondered for a moment if he should press the issue further.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Blackwell said, reading his mind. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to know. Just a little document with a&nbsp;. . . questionable signature.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does Park know of this?&#x201d; Daniel said quickly. When Blackwell looked chagrined, Daniel realized it was Park for whom he&#x2019;d forged a document. &#x201c;So that might give him a reason to damage you,&#x201d; Daniel said eagerly. At last he might be on to something.<br><br>Blackwell&#x2019;s eyebrows rose high. &#x201c;I did him a favor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He incurred a debt. He either can&#x2019;t pay it, or doesn&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty-�five.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And so cynical!&#x201d; Blackwell sighed.<br><br>&#x201c;It comes from being a lawyer. What was the favor?&#x201d;<br><br>Blackwell was silent for several moments.<br><br>Daniel tightened his grip on Blackwell&#x2019;s wrist. &#x201c;Roman&#x2014;�we haven&#x2019;t got time to spare. They&#x2019;ll be coming for us any moment now. What did you do for Park that he can&#x2019;t afford to repay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I told you&#x2014;�I&#x2019;ve got no proof!&#x201d; Blackwell repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know that. Come on!&#x201d; Daniel said sharply &#x201c;Details&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>Blackwell remained silent.<br><br>&#x201c;You asked me if they would hang you,&#x201d; Daniel said between his teeth, hating the sound of his voice. &#x201c;Yes, they will! And once the verdict is in, it&#x2019;s hell&#x2019;s own job to change it!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right! I wrote up some documents for him&nbsp;. . . once. And a letter to recommend him. It was&#x2014;�inventive.&#x201d; Blackwell wrinkled his nose. &#x201c;Do I need to spell it out for you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why was that so bad? What did you say that wasn&#x2019;t true?&#x201d; Daniel asked.<br><br>&#x201c;That he was honest, and had a position of trust in a company doing business abroad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And he hadn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No such company. I signed a dead man&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;<br><br>Blackwell looked rueful. &#x201c;Does he still have the position?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. On the strength of that letter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And has he abused that position?&#x201d; Daniel already knew the answer. It was written on Blackwell&#x2019;s face, the pride and shame at the same time.<br><br>&#x201c;But the owners don&#x2019;t know yet, and if I speak now, somebody else will get the blame,&#x201d; he answered.<br><br>&#x201c;And if I don&#x2019;t call him into question, somebody else will get the blame for killing Hinton: you will!&#x201d;<br><br>Before Blackwell could reply, the door swung open. A remarkably handsome woman stood on the threshold. She was of less than average height, and time had added nicely to her magnificent bosom and hips. Her black hair was wound thickly at the back of her head, made the more striking by a streak of white at the front. Her olive skin was flushed with exertion, and probably temper, and her black eyes flashed fire.<br><br>She ignored Blackwell and looked straight at Daniel.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better do something, young man!

She was Blackwell&#x2019;s mother, and it was she who had engaged Daniel&#x2019;s services, to the very mixed feelings of Mr. fford Croft, head of the firm fford Croft and Gibson.<br><br>She closed the door behind her and walked over to stand next to the table.

But what if history-or what we come to know as history-has been written by the wrong people? What if everything we&#39;ve been told is only part of the story? In this groundbreaking and now famous work, Mark Booth embarks on an enthralling tour of our world&#39;s secret histories. Starting from a dangerous premise-that everything we&#39;ve known about our world&#39;s past is corrupted, and that the stories put forward by the various cults and mystery schools throughout history are true-Booth produces nothing short of an alternate history of the past 3,000 years. From Greek and Egyptian mythology to Jewish folklore, from Christian cults to Freemasons, from Charlemagne to Don Quixote, from George Washington to Hitler- Booth shows that history needs a revolutionary rethink, and he has 3,000 years of hidden wisdom to back it up.</p><p><p><b>Praise for THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE WORLD</b></p> <p>"The powerful narrative drive and cornucopia of startling revelations that form the core of Mark Booth's new book show us the world not as we have been taught to see it but as it really is - deeply strange and mysterious, filled with secrets and codes, with humanity rightly placed at the heart of a grand cosmic riddle.

According to &#34;The Washington Post&#34;, &#34;Gail Gibbons has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator.&#34; She lives in Vermont. Her website is www.gailgibbons.comGr. 2^-4, younger for reading aloud. This fully illustrated introductory book offers young children information about the moon: its orbit and phases, its place in solar and lunar eclipses, its effect on Earth's oceans, moon exploration, and the legends the moon has inspired in various cultures. Written clearly yet without too much detail, the text moves along quickly. The pictures and diagrams deserve study, as they help readers visualize such concepts as how the moon moves in relation to the earth and the sun and why it seems to change shape. Gibbons uses a spacious format to vary page layout, presenting each facet of the moon's story with a large illustration or a series of smaller ones. Her colorful pictures of people observing the moon seem all the more brilliant against backgrounds of midnight blue. A fine resource for school and public library collections. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Sculpture Now (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>An authoritative, highly readable new survey that reveals the great diversity and energy within sculptural practice today</strong></p> Here are the most exciting developments in sculpture across the globe since the mid-1990s.

Bork has served as Solicitor General and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and as a United States Court of Appeals judge. A former professor of law at Yale Law School, he is currently a professor at Ave Maria School of Law, a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and the Tad and Dianne Taube Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Also the author of the bestselling The Tempting of America, he lives with his wife in McLean, Virginia.Bork portrays the Senate's rejection of his nomination to the Supreme Court as one skirmish in a broader battle over the political role of American judges. For a journalist's account of the nomination uproar, see Ethan Bronner's Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America ( LJ 9/1/89).-- Ed. On one side, Bork claims, are those who--regardless of personal convictions--adhere to the intentions of the Founding Fathers in interpreting the U.S. Constitution. Arrayed against them are various liberal groups and their allies in the law schools, who disdain the political process and promote judicial lawmaking to achieve their goals. Bork convincingly demonstrates that some opponents of his confirmation distorted his record and his views. However, in refusing to admit the good faith of opposing scholars, he does little to encourage dialog on constitutional interpretation.<br><i>- G.

Sometimes pioneer life is hard, but Laura and her folks are always busy and happy in their new little house.</p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867&#x2013;1957) was born in a log cabin in the Wisconsin woods.

She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics.

Why have so many people been willing to die for such places throughout the twentieth century? What is the essence of the Promised Land?

Sand&#x2019;s account dissects the concept of &#x201c;historical right&#x201d; and tracks the creation of the modern concept of the &#x201c;Land of Israel&#x201d; by nineteenth-century Evangelical Protestants and Jewish Zionists.

Along with The Dark Night Of The Soul, The Living Flame of God, and the Spiritual Canticle, The Ascent Of Mount Carmel is regarded as one of the greatest works of mysticism in Christianity. In The Ascent Of Mount Carmel St John of the Cross illustrates the Soul&#39;s progress to the summit of the metaphorical Mt Carmel where God is encountered. The book is divided into three sections and is presented as a commentary on four poetic stanzas by John on the subject of the Dark Night. He shows how the Soul sets out to leave all worldly ties and appetites behind to achieve &#34;nothing less than transformation in God&#34;. Saint John of the Cross was a major figure of the Counter-Reformation, a Spanish mystic, Catholic saint, Carmelite friar and priest. He was also a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered, along with Saint Teresa of �vila, as a founder of the Discalced Carmelites.</p><p></p><h2>Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War</h2><p>A brilliant biography of Jesse James, and a stunning reinterpretation of an American icon. Stripped of the familiar myths surrounding him, James emerges a far more significant figure: ruthless, purposeful, intensely political; a man who, in the midst of his crimes and notoriety, made himself a spokesman for the renewal of the Confederate cause during the bitter decade that followed Appomattox.<br><br>Traditionally, Jesse James has been portrayed as a Wild West bandit, a Robin Hood of sorts. But in this meticulously researched, vividly written account of his life, he emerges as far more complicated. Raised in a fiercely pro-slavery atmosphere in bitterly divided Missouri, he began at sixteen to fight alongside some of the most savage Confederate guerrillas. When the Civil War ended, his violent path led him into the brutal conflicts of Reconstruction.<br><br>We follow James as he places himself squarely in the forefront of the former Confederates&#x2019; bid to capture political power with his reckless daring, his visibility, his partisan pronouncements, and his alliance with a rising ex-Confederate editor, John Newman Edwards, who helped shape James&#x2019;s image for their common purpose. In uniting violence and the news media on behalf of a political cause, James was hardly the quaint figure of legend. Rather, as his life played out across the racial divide, the rise of the Klan, and the expansion of the railroads, he was a forerunner of what we have come to call a terrorist. <br><br>T.J. Stiles has written a memorable book--a revelation of both the man and his time.</p><p>Probably no American outlaw has attracted more attention--much of it flattering--than Jesse James. This revisionist biography by T.J. Stiles delves into the exciting life James led--"a tale of ambushes, gun battles, and daring raids, of narrow escapes, betrayals, and revenge." Yet it also places James within a specific political context, showing why it was possible for this murderous bandit to emerge as a folk hero among Southern sympathizers following the Civil War (in which he fought as a teenager). James is often grouped with famous frontier criminals like Billy the Kidd and Butch Cassidy, but he's best understood as a Southerner who forged partisan alliances in postwar Missouri and promoted himself as a latter-day Robin Hood. Stiles describes James as "a foul-mouthed killer who hated as fiercely as anyone on the planet" and places his life in the context of "the struggle for--or rather, against--black freedom." Stiles's fundamental point about James is as startling as it is convincing: "In his political consciousness and close alliance with a propagandist and power broker, in his efforts to win media attention with his crimes ... Jesse James was a forerunner of the modern terrorist." Tough words, but also deserved. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"At last, a meaningful Jesse James, shorn of hero-worship and stale theories of social banditry. His violence is now placed correctly in the realm of politics, and we can now see the Jesse James who embodied the brutal legacy of the Civil War in its most contested space -- the Border West."<br>-- Christopher Phillips, author, <i>Missouri's Confederate</i></p><h2>The Gospels and Acts of the Apostles [The Navarre Bible: Reader&#39;s Edition], Packaging may vary</h2><p>This handy volume contains the world-renowned commentary that appeared in the multi-volume edition of the Navarre Bible, as well as the complete English text (in the reliable Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition) of each of the first five New Testament books.

WESTLAKE has written numerous novels over the past thirty-five years under his own name and pseudonyms, including Richard Stark. Many of his books have been made into movies, including The Hunter, which became the brilliant film noir Point Blank, and the 1999 smash hit Payback. He penned the Hollywood scripts for The Stepfather and The Grifters, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay. The winner of three Edgar awards and a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Donald E. Westlake was presented with The Eye, the Private Eye Writers of America&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award, at the Shamus Awards. He lives with his wife, Abby Adams, in rural New York State.John Dortmunder and his merry band of burglars are back for another go at their own version of wealth distribution--the planned burglary of a fabulous art collection from a semi-deserted penthouse apartment. Westlake offers several detours along the way and four--perhaps five--interrelated plots, as well as a boxcar load of quirky characters. William Dufris brings all his skills to this Westlake entertainment. The main characters are from New York and New Jersy, giving Dufris a chance to explore the heights of their accents. He makes each main character a recognizable individual and creates memorable versions of the cameo roles, which range from Club Med staffers to Florida bonefishermen. He also handles women's voices expertly. All this while delivering a well-paced narration.

And the stories of those soldiers are the stories of Glen Cook's hugely popular "Black Company" novels. If the Joseph Heller of Catch-22 were to tell the story of The Lord of the Rings, it might read like the Black Company books. There is nothing else in fantasy like them.<br><br>Now, at last, Cook brings the "Glittering Stone" cycle within the Black Company series to an end . . . but an end with many other tales left to tell. As Soldiers Live opens, Croaker is military dictator of all the Taglias, and no Black Company member has died in battle for four years. Croaker figures it can't last. He's right.<br><br>For, of course, many of the Company's old adversaries are still around. Narayan Singh and his adopted daughter--actually the offspring of Croaker and the Lady--hope to bring about the apocalyptic Year of the Skulls. Other old enemies like Shadowcatcher, Longshadow, and Howler are also ready to do the Company harm. And much of the Company is still recovering from the fifteen years many of them spent in a stasis field.<br><br>Then a report arrives of an evil spirit, a forvalaka, that has taken over one of their old enemies. It attacks them at a shadowgate--setting off a chain of events that will bring the Company to the edge of apocalypse and, as usual, several steps beyond.<br><br>Glen Cook is the leading modern writer of epic fantasy noir, and <i>Soldiers Live</i> is Cook at his best.

He got his start in advertising, first as an award-winning copy writer, and then as creative director for two of the nation's largest agencies. His initial foray into fiction was in 1973, when he wrote his first Dirk Pitt� novel.<p>Since then he has continued to write Dirk Pitt� adventures while living a life that nearly parallels that of his action hero. Like Pitt, Cussler enjoys discovering and collecting things of historical significance. With NUMA (National Underwater &amp; Marine Agency, a non profit group begun by Cussler) he has had an amazing record of finding over 60 shipwrecks, one of which was the long-lost Confederate submarine Hunley. Cussler also has a renowned and extensive classic car collection, which features over 80 examples of custom coachwork.</p><p>Along with being Chairman of NUMA, he is also a fellow of the Explorers Club (which honored him with the Lowell Thomas Award for outstanding underwater exploration), the Royal Geographical Society and the American Society of Oceanographers. Married to Barbara Knight for 40 years, with three children and two grandchildren, he divides his time between the mountains of Colorado and the deserts of Arizona.</p>Written in the bestselling style of Pacific Vortex! and Deep Six, and with the indestructible Dirk Pitt as its hero, this latest Cussler suspense caper features, and ingeniously connects, a maverick American colony on the Moon, a fabulous sunken treasure sought by an unscrupulous, blimp-owning financier, and two cunningly devised Soviet schemes, one to steal U.S. space secrets, the other to replace Fidel Castro with a Kremlin puppet, no matter what the cost in human lives. The nonstop action involves murder and torture as well as superpower politicking, and Pitt extricates himself from one desperate situation after another, even finding time for a little romance. The writing is brittle, but the reader is not likely to worry about that in a story whose plot resembles a box of exploding fireworks and poses some interesting questions regarding both Cuba and the militarization of space.

In this new book Hawking takes us to the cutting edge of theoretical physics, where truth is often stranger than fiction, to explain in laymen&#39;s terms the principles that control our universe. Like many in the community of theoretical physicists, Professor Hawking is seeking to uncover the grail of science - the elusive Theory of Everything that lies at the heart of the cosmos. In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his search to uncover the secrets of the universe - from supergravity to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography to duality. He takes us to the wild frontiers of science, where superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle. And he lets us behind the scenes of one of his most exciting intellectual adventures as he seeks &#34;to combine Einstein&#39;s General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman&#39;s idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.&#34; With characteristic exuberance, Professor Hawking invites us to be fellow travelers on this extraordinary voyage through space-time. Copious four-color illustrations help clarify this journey into a surreal wonderland where particles, sheets, and strings move in eleven dimensions; where black holes evaporate and disappear, taking their secret with them; and where the original cosmic seed from which our own universe sprang was a tiny nut. The Universe in a Nutshell is essential reading for all of us who want to understand the universe in which we live. Like its companion volume, A Brief History of Time, it conveys the excitement felt within the scientific community as the secrets of the cosmos reveal themselves.</p><p></p><h2>Thanksgiving Is . . .</h2><p><b>Thanksgiving is...

Who better than Robin Givhan to tell this captivating story?" - Diane von Furstenberg</p><p>On November 28, 1973, the world's social elite gathered at the Palace of Versailles for an international fashion show. By the time the curtain came down on the evening's spectacle, history had been made and the industry had been forever transformed. This is that story.</p><p>Conceived as a fund-raiser for the restoration of King Louis XIV's palace, in the late fall of 1973, five top American designers faced off against five top French designers in an over-the-top runway extravaganza. An audience filled with celebrities and international jet-setters, including Princess Grace of Monaco, the Duchess of Windsor, Paloma Picasso, and Andy Warhol, were treated to an opulent performance featuring Liza Minnelli, Josephine Baker, and Rudolph Nureyev. What they saw would forever alter the history of fashion.</p><p>The Americans at the Battle of Versailles- Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass, Anne Klein, Halston, and Stephen Burrows - showed their work against the five French designers considered the best in the world - Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Cardin, Emanuel Ungaro, and Marc Bohan of Christian Dior. Plagued by in-fighting, outsized egos, shoestring budgets, and innumerable technical difficulties, the American contingent had little chance of meeting the European's exquisite and refined standards. But against all odds, the American energy and the domination by the fearless models (ten of whom, in a groundbreaking move, were African American) sent the audience reeling. By the end of the evening, the Americans had officially taken their place on the world's stage, prompting a major shift in the way race, gender, sexuality, and economics would be treated in fashion for decades to come. As the curtain came down on The Battle of Versailles, American fashion was born; no longer would the world look to Europe to determine the stylistic trends of the day, from here forward, American sensibility and taste would command the world's attention. </p><p>Pulitzer-Prize winning fashion journalist Robin Givhan offers a lively and meticulously well-researched account of this unique event. The Battle of Versailles is a sharp, engaging cultural history; this intimate examination of a single moment shows us how the world of fashion as we know it came to be.</p></p><p>ROBIN GIVHAN is the fashion critic of The Washington Post, where she covers the news, trends, and business of the international fashion industry, and the former style correspondent for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. She has also contributed to New York and Vogue, among other magazines. In 2006, she won the Pulitzer Prize in criticism for her fashion coverage. The Battle of Versailles is her first book.<p>&#x201c;Givhan handles the story-and all its gossip, backbiting, and raging egos-with meticulous dexterity. She has an eye for the absurd and flamboyant detail...some [of which] seem astonishing in retrospect. The Americans...stunned the crowd that night... with their success in capturing the spirit of the modern woman through both their clothes and the pure energy they poured into the show.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thessaly La Force, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;In her debut book, Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post fashion critic Givhan delivers a delightful, encyclopedic exploration of the players and leaders in the field.... Readers need not be fashion mavens to enjoy this entertaining episode of history, enhanced by Givhan's effortless ability to illustrate the models and designers (particularly Lambert) who changed how we dress.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kirkus Reviews</p><p>&#x201c;Givhan paints a captivating portrait of the ethos of the era, from race riots and the Kerner Report to a "cultural... fascination with black identity" and glamorous nights at the disco, with juicy tales about arrogant designers acting out. While candid about the designers' faults, this is largely a glowing tribute to five iconic artists and their legacy in the fashion world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Publishers Weekly</p><p>&#x201c;It was a big deal when American Fashion went to Versailles...who better than Robin Givhan to tell this captivating story?&#x201d; &#x2015;Diane von Furstenberg</p><p>&#x201c;Reality TV has nothing on The Battle of Versailles. The year is 1973, and five legendary French couturiers face off against a team of their Seventh Avenue counterparts. There are hissy fits, liveried footmen, a party at Maxim's, and (prefiguring "Spinal Tap") a backdrop mistakenly measured in feet instead of meters. Halston refers to himself in the third person. A motley supporting cast that includes Josephine Baker, Liza Minnelli, Kay Thompson, Rudolf Nureyev, showgirls from the Crazy Horse, and a phalanx of dazzling black American models creates a spectacle, and the gratin of Paris society turns out. In this picturesque account, Robin Givhan weaves together the tectonic social and cultural shifts that set the stage for an epic fashion showdown.&#x201d; &#x2015;Holly Brubach, author of A DEDICATED FOLLOWER OF FASHION</p><p>&#x201c;In The Battle of Versailles, Pulitzer-prizing winning fashion critic Robin Givhan expertly captures the players and the scene of a turning point in both fashion and American culture, showing that chutzpah and savviness count as much as craftsmanship and refinement. With in-depth reporting and her warm, informative voice, Givhan proves that a fashion show is about far more than clothes. Indeed, as this fascinating book shows, it can spark a social revolution.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dana Thomas, author of the New York Times bestselling DELUXE: HOW LUXURY LOST ITS LUSTER</p><p>&#x201c;Robin Givhan's book recounts how the French fashion establishment in November 1973 fell in love with American couture. The Battle of Versailles tells the behind-the-scene story of the night that wildly cheering French critics gave a standing ovation to five American designers and their stunning black models. Givhan provides readers with both a front row and backstage view of the drama. It's a wonderfully fun read of how a few daring Yanks won recognition in world fashion.&#x201d; &#x2015;George Taber, author of THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS</p><p>&#x201c;[Givhan's] witty, closely observed essays...transformed fashion criticism into cultural criticism.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>2006 Pulitzer Prize Committee</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Battle of Versailles</i> is a fashion primer, a history lesson and a juicy tale with colorful and insightful character studies.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Newsday</i></p><p>&#x201c;As she sets up the saga of the legendary Versailles show, Givhan miraculously gives enough history and back story to paint a backdrop for the action in her swiftly-moving tale without burdening the plot with unnecessary details.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fashion critic Robin Givhan dismantles the story of how sexual, racial and gender tensions in the U.S. helped create the perfect environment for American designers to burst upon the exclusive French fashion scene one fateful night in 1973.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;Robin Givhan's enthusiastic history "The Battle of Versailles" is an effort to do for fashion what George Taber's "The Judgment of Paris" did for wine: focus on a broad cultural shift through the lens of a single occasion...

His grandparents were among the first settlers of Corenwald&#x2019;s Eastern Frontier. His father had been one of the kingdom&#x2019;s greatest warriors. Aidan, on the other hand, lives the quiet, comfortable life of a nobleman&#x2019;s son. He never has any real adventures, and that, he believes, is the one great injustice of his otherwise happy life.All that will change the day he first hears the bark of the bog owl and meets Dobro Turtlebane. Dobro is one of the feechiefolk&#x2014;a tribe of half-civilized swamp dwellers who fight too much, laugh too loud, cry too easily, and smell just terrible.But another meeting on that remarkable day may change Aidan&#x2019;s life even more profoundly. Bayard the Truthspeaker arrives with a startling pronouncement: Aidan Errolson will grow to be the Wilderking&#x2014;the long-prophesied wild man who will come out of Corenwald&#x2019;s forests and swamps to lead the kingdom back to its former glory.There&#x2019;s just one question: Is Bayard the Truthspeaker a prophet or a madman?This initial installment in The Wilderking Trilogy is sure to capture the hearts of young and old, boys and girls alike. Written in the same fashion as The Lord of the Rings or The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Bark of the Bog Owl, as the author says, will help &#x201c;direct a God-fearing boy&#x2019;s sense of adventure and warrior spirit &#x2013; his God-given wildness.&#x201d;</p><p>Courage and a heart for adventure drive twelve-year-old shepherd boy Aidan Errolson. When the bark of the bog owl echoes from the forest across his father's well-tended pastures, Aidan dreams of wild places still untamed and quests not yet pursued. <p> Aidan's life changes forever on the day Bayard the Truthspeaker arrives at Longleaf with an astonishing pronouncement: it is Aidan's destiny to be the Wilderking, who will ascend to the throne from Corenwald's wildest places. Only the Wilderking can balance his people's civilizing impulses with the wildness that gives Corenwald its vitality. But not just yet. Many trials and adventures will shape the shaggy-headed shepherd boy into the man who can bring the kingdom back to its former glory.</p><p><b>Jonathan Rogers</b> holds a Ph.D. in seventeenth-century British literature from Vanderbilt University where he also taught English for five years. He lives with his wife and their six children in Nashville, Tennessee.</p></p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cyrus Spitama, aged Persian ambassador to Athens, recounts his official and personal journeys throughout the world of the fifth century B.C. and his encounters with the Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, and other great men of an extraordinary century</p><p>In 445 B.C., Cyrus Spitama, the grandson of the prophet Zoroaster, is the Persian ambassador to the city of Athens. He has a rather caustic appreciation of his situation: "I am blind. But I am not deaf. Because of the incompleteness of my misfortune, I was obliged yesterday to listen for nearly six hours to a self-styled historian whose account of what the Athenians like to call 'the Persian Wars' was nonsense of a sort that were I less old and more privileged, I would have risen to my seat at the Odeon and scandalized all Athens by answering him." Having thus dismissed Herodotus, Cyrus then dictates his life story to his nephew, Democritus, with similar disdain for the Greeks--whom we in the modern world have come to view as the progenitors of civilization, but whom Cyrus considers to be bad-smelling rabble.<p> Of course, Cyrus Spitama speaks with a very modern, ironic voice supplied to him by Gore Vidal--and the political intrigues in which Cyrus finds himself immersed are likewise familiar territory for fans of Vidal's historical fiction. But the narrator's delightfully wicked observations are the icing on a narrative of truly epic scope--out of his desire to understand the origins of the world, Cyrus undertakes journeys to India, where he encounters disciples of the Buddha, and China, where he engages Confucius in philosophical conversation while the great sage fishes by the riverside. <i>Creation</i> offers insights into classical history laced with scintillating wit and narrative brio.</p>A sweeping novel of politics, war, philosophy, and adventure-in a restored edition, featuring never-before-published material from Gore Vidal's original manuscript-Creation" offers a captivating grand tour of the ancient world.<br>Cyrus Spitama, grandson of the prophet Zoroaster and lifelong friend of Xerxes, spent most of his life as Persian ambassador for the great king Darius. He traveled to India, where he discussed nirvana with Buddha, and to the warring states of Cathay, where he learned of Tao from Master Li and fished on the riverbank with Confucius. Now blind and aged in Athens-the Athens of Pericles, Sophocles, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Socrates-Cyrus recounts his days as he strives to resolve the fundamental questions that have guided his life's journeys: how the universe was created, and why evil was created with good. In revisiting the fifth century b.c.-one of the most spectacular periods in history-Gore Vidal illuminates the ideas that have shaped civilizations for millennia."<br></p><h2>The Pilgrims of Rayne (8) (Pendragon)</h2><p>Learning about the secret of Meyapolo, Bobby&#39;s only chance of saving the island and its people from ruin is to stop Saint Dane from making Ibara the staging ground for the final attack, but he will need the help of Courtney to get the job done, in the latest addition to the Pendragon series.</p><p>D.J. MacHale is the author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Pendragon series and the Morpheus Road series. He has written, directed and produced many television series and movies for young people that have been seen on Nickelodeon, The Disney Channel, HBO, Showtime, PBS, Discovery Kids, and the broadcast networks. D.J. lives with his family in Southern California.As circumstances become dire for Bobby Pendragon, the hero of this series, narrator William Dufris continues to balance Bobby&#39;s bemused pop-culture outlook with the grim realities of his fight to save Halla. The eighth book in the riveting series brings Bobby to the territory of Ibara, a seemingly peaceful agrarian land. Bobby joins forces with the Jakills, a group of children who resist the obliviousness of their elders to try to stop the villain Saint Dane from bringing down Ibara. In voicing both the lively, youthful dialogue of the Jakills and the otherworldly speech of the robotic armies of dados, Dufris demonstrates that he continues to be the perfect match for this imaginative series.

She would do anything for me, including asking her parents for the tuition money to send me to Chilton, this prestigious prep school that just accepted me.

Jump aboard! Grab hold of my hand. / We're crossing the border into Look-Alike Land." So invites the opening lines of Joan Steiner's <i>Look-Alikes</i>, a three-dimensional miniature metropolis that's meticulously, ingeniously crafted out of everyday objects from mousetraps to milk bones. At first glance, a fancy hotel lobby seems just that, but take a closer look and you'll see a sofa made of gloves. In a sunny street scene, a building fa�ade is laden with crackers, crayons form fence posts, and the tree is shaded by a stalk of broccoli. Children and adults alike will love poring over each picture, most of which contain more than 100 objects cleverly arranged to delight and deceive. Kids will easily identify many household objects, and the ones they may not recognize--a hosiery garter or flour sifter, for example--they'll learn from either the guide in the back or from a helpful parent. Good humor, a keen eye, and hours of hard work went into this visual marvel, which should be equally captivating for artists and I Spy fans.

How did you come to be a three-dimensional artist? </p><p>After I had been out of college for several years knocking around from one job to another that I didn't find satisfying, it occurred to me that I should try to make a career out of the thing I loved best (art) even if I had to do something fairly lowly in that field. That's how I began, and I turned out to be a little more talented than I expected. I discovered that the thing one loves best is likely to be the thing one does best. </p><p>Q. How did you decide to translate your art into a picture book format? </p><p>I loved doing these puzzles, and had been doing them for several years, but there were limited uses for them in terms of magazines and posters. A friend suggested that I try making a picture book incorporating my puzzles. But it took a long time to come up with a concept that would tie it all together. Then I came up with the idea of visiting a land where everything looked like something else. </p><p>Q. How long does it take for you to construct each scene? </p><p>It took me three and one half years total to complete the book, and each scene took several months to create. Some scenes took longer than others - like the train and the city scenes took forever because I was still working out the ideas while I put it together. I kept making them more intricate than I originally envisioned. </p><p>Q. How do you find the things you use in your creations? </p><p>Mostly by shopping! But it is not ordinary shopping. My projects take me to all different kinds of stores and other places too, like hardware stores, party stores, thrift shops, brickyards and art stores. I can spend four to six hours in one big store (very tiring!), slowly going up and down the aisles looking for ideas or for specific objects. I may spend ten minutes carefully looking at a mousetrap, turning it from side to side and upside down, thinking about whether it's something I can use. No wonder I attract the attention of store detectives! </p><p>I will go great lengths to get just the right item. For the circus scene, I decided I wanted to make the tent out of trench coat. I couldn't afford to buy a new trench coat just to make a tent out of it, so I visited a lot of thrift shops and Salvation Army stores. Of course you can't always tell what will work until you try it out, so I wound up buying several. Now I have a trenchcoat collection. </p><p>Q. What is the most unusual object you have incorporated into your art? </p><p>There is a hand grenade in the general store - that is probably the most unusual. Also cheese doodle are very challenging, and hard to glue!</p></p><h2>The Man in the Mirror: Solving the 24 Problems Men Face (25th Anniversary Edtion, Revised and Updated)</h2><p>Identity.

Is there, beyond all the casual and incalculable elements of the separate events, something that we may call a metaphysical structure of historic humanity, something that is essentially independent of the outward forms--social, spiritual and political--which we see so clearly? Are not these actualities indeed secondary or derived from that something? Does world-history present to the seeing eye certain grand traits, again and again, with sufficient constancy to justify certain conclusions? And if so, what are the limits to which reasoning from such premisses may be pushed? <br> <br>Is it possible to find in life itself--for human history is the sum of mighty life-courses which already have had to be endowed with ego and personality, in customary thought and expression, by predicating entities of a higher order like "the Classical" or "the Chinese Culture," "Modern Civilization"--a series of stages which must be traversed, and traversed moreover in an ordered and obligatory sequence? For everything organic the notions of birth, death, youth, age, lifetime are fundamentals--may not these notions, in this sphere also, possess a rigorous meaning which no one has as yet extracted? In short, is all history founded upon general biographic archetypes? <br> <br>The decline of the West, which at first sight may appear, like the corresponding decline of the Classical Culture, a phenomenon limited in time and space, we now perceive to be a philosophical problem that, when comprehended... <br> <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br> <br>Windham Press is committed to bringing the lost cultural heritage of ages past into the 21st century through high-quality reproductions of original, classic printed works at affordable prices. <br> <br>This book has been carefully crafted to utilize the original images of antique books rather than error-prone OCR text.

Frigid. Dark.</p> <p>Dark because Mags was outside at midnight, and dark because she was in the shadows.</p> <p>This was the last place anyone would look for her&#x2014;anyone, and especially Noel. She&#x2019;d miss all the excitement.</p> <p>Thank God. Mags should have thought of this years ago.</p> <p>She leaned back against Alicia&#x2019;s house and started eating the Chex mix she&#x2019;d brought out with her. (Alicia&#x2019;s mom made the best Chex mix.) Mags could hear the music playing inside, and then she couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and that was a good sign. It meant that the countdown was starting.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Ten!&#x201d;</i> she heard someone shout.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Nine!&#x201d;</i> more people joined in.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Eight!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>Mags was going to miss the whole thing.</p> <p>Perfect.</p> <p>Dec. 31, 2011, almost midnight</p> <p>&#x201c;Are there nuts in that?&#x201d; the boy asked.</p> <p>Mags paused, holding a cracker piled with pesto and cream cheese in front of her mouth. &#x201c;I think there are pine nuts&#x2026;&#x201d; she said, crossing her eyes to look at it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are pine nuts tree nuts?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Mags said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think pine nuts grow on pine trees, do they?&#x201d;</p> <p>The boy shrugged. He had shaggy brown hair and wide-open blue eyes. He was wearing a Pok�mon T-shirt.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not much of a tree-nut expert,&#x201d; Mags said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Me neither,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think I would be&#x2014;if I accidentally eat one, it could kill me. If there were something out there that could kill you, wouldn&#x2019;t you try to be an expert on it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x2026;&#x201d; Mags shoved the cracker in her mouth and started chewing. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know very much about cancer. Or car accidents.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah&#x2026;&#x201d; the boy said, looking sadly at the buffet table. He was skinny. And pale. &#x201c;But tree nuts specifically have it out for me, for me <i>personally.</i> They&#x2019;re more like assassins than, like, possible dangers.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Mags said, &#x201c;what&#x2019;d you ever do to tree nuts?&#x201d;</p> <p>The boy laughed. &#x201c;Ate them, I guess.&#x201d;</p> <p>The music, which had been really loud, stopped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost midnight!&#x201d; somebody shouted.</p> <p>They both looked around. Mags&#x2019;s friend Alicia, from homeroom, was standing on the couch. It was Alicia&#x2019;s party&#x2014;the first New Year&#x2019;s Eve party that Mags, at fifteen, had ever been invited to.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Nine!&#x201d;</i> Alicia yelled.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Eight!&#x201d;</i> There were a few dozen people in the basement, and they were all shouting now.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Seven!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Noel,&#x201d; the boy said, holding out his hand.</p> <p>Mags brushed all the pesto and traces of nuts off her hand and shook his. &#x201c;Mags.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Four!&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Three!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to meet you, Mags.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You, too, Noel. Congratulations on evading the tree nuts for another year.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They almost had me with that pesto dip.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She nodded. &#x201c;It was a close call.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dec. 31, 2012, almost midnight</p> <p>Noel fell against the wall and slid down next to Mags, then bumped his shoulder against hers. He blew a paper party horn in her direction. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; She smiled at him. He was wearing a plaid jacket, and his white shirt was open at the collar. Noel was pale and flushed easily. Right now he was pink from the top of his forehead to the second button of his shirt. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dancing machine,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>&#x201c;I like to dance, Mags.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you do.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And I only get so many opportunities.&#x201d;</p> <p>She raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>&#x201c;I like to dance <i>in public,</i>&#x201d; Noel said. &#x201c;With other people. It&#x2019;s a communal experience.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I kept your tie safe,&#x201d; she said, and held out a red silk necktie. He&#x2019;d been dancing on the coffee table when he threw it at her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said, taking it and slinging it around his neck. &#x201c;That was a good catch&#x2014;but I was actually trying to lure you out onto the dance floor.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That was a coffee table, Noel.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There was room for two, Margaret.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags wrinkled her nose, considering. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think there was.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s always room for you with me, on every coffee table,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Because you are my best friend.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Pony is your best friend.&#x201d;</p> <p>Noel ran his fingers through his hair. It was sweaty and curly and fell past his ears. &#x201c;Pony is also my best friend. And also Frankie. And Connor.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And your mom,&#x201d; Mags said.</p> <p>Noel turned his grin on her. &#x201c;But especially you. It&#x2019;s our anniversary. I can&#x2019;t believe you wouldn&#x2019;t dance with me on our anniversary.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; she said. (She knew exactly what he was talking about.)</p> <p>&#x201c;It happened right there.&#x201d; Noel pointed at the buffet table where Alicia&#x2019;s mom always laid out snacks. &#x201c;I was having an allergic reaction, and you saved my life. You stuck an epinephrine pen into my heart.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I ate some pesto,&#x201d; Mags said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Heroically,&#x201d; Noel agreed.</p> <p>She sat up suddenly. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t eat any of the chicken salad tonight, did you? There were almonds.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Still saving my life,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Did</i> you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. But I had some fruit cocktail. I think there were strawberries in it&#x2014;my mouth is all tingly.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags squinted at him. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>Noel looked okay. He looked flushed. And sweaty. He looked like his teeth were too wide for his mouth, and his mouth was too wide for his face.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you if my tongue gets puffy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Keep your lewd allergic reactions to yourself,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>Noel wiggled his eyebrows. &#x201c;You should see what happens when I eat shellfish.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags rolled her eyes and tried not to laugh. After a second, she looked over at him again. &#x201c;Wait, what happens when you eat shellfish?&#x201d;</p> <p>He waved his hand in front of his chest, halfheartedly. &#x201c;I get a rash.&#x201d;</p> <p>She frowned. &#x201c;<i>How</i> are you still alive?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Through the efforts of everyday heroes like yourself.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t eat the pink salad, either,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s shrimp.&#x201d;</p> <p>Noel flicked his red tie around her neck and smiled at her. Which was different than a grin. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank <i>you,</i>&#x201d; she said, pulling the ends of the tie even and looking down at them. &#x201c;It matches my sweater.&#x201d; Mags was wearing a giant sweater dress, some sort of Scandinavian design with a million colors.</p> <p>&#x201c;Everything matches your sweater,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You look like a Christmas-themed Easter egg.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I feel like a really colorful Muppet,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;One of the fuzzy ones.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I like it,&#x201d; Noel said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a feast for the senses.&#x201d;</p> <p>She couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was making fun of her, so she changed the subject. &#x201c;Where did Pony go?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Over there.&#x201d; Noel pointed across the room. &#x201c;He wanted to get in position to be standing casually near Simini when midnight strikes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So he can kiss her?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Noel said. &#x201c;On the mouth, if all goes to plan.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so gross,&#x201d; Mags said, fiddling with the ends of Noel&#x2019;s tie.</p> <p>&#x201c;Kissing?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No&nbsp;&#x2026; kissing is fine.&#x201d; She felt herself blushing. Fortunately she wasn&#x2019;t as pale as Noel; it wouldn&#x2019;t be painted all over her face and throat. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s gross is using New Year&#x2019;s Eve as an excuse to kiss someone who might want not want to kiss you. Using it as a trick.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe Simini <i>does</i> want to kiss Pony.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Or maybe it&#x2019;ll be really awkward,&#x201d; Mags said. &#x201c;And she&#x2019;ll do it anyway because she feels like she has to.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to maul her,&#x201d; Noel said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll do the eye contact thing.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What eye contact thing?&#x201d;</p> <p>Noel swung his head around and made eye contact with Mags. He raised his eyebrows hopefully; his eyes went all soft and possible. It was definitely a face that said, <i>Hey. Is it okay if I kiss you?</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Mags said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s really good.&#x201d;</p> <p>Noel snapped out of it&#x2014;and made a face that said, <i>Well, duh.</i> &#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s good. I&#x2019;ve kissed girls before.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Have</i> you?&#x201d; Mags asked. She knew that Noel talked to girls. But she&#x2019;d never heard of him having a girlfriend. And she <i>would</i> have heard of it&#x2014;she was one of Noel&#x2019;s four to five best friends.</p> <p>&#x201c;Pfft,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Three girls. Eight different occasions. I think I know how to make eye contact.&#x201d;</p> <p>That was significantly more kissing than Mags had managed in her sixteen years.</p> <p>She glanced over at Pony again. He was standing near the television, studying his phone. Simini was a few feet away, talking to her friends.</p> <p>&#x201c;Still,&#x201d; Mags said, &#x201c;it feels like cheating.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How is it cheating?&#x201d; Noel asked, following her eyes. &#x201c;Neither of them is in a relationship.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not that kind of cheating,&#x201d; Mags said. &#x201c;More like&nbsp;&#x2026; skipping ahead. If you like someone, you should have to make an effort. You should have to get to know the person&#x2014;you should have to <i>work</i> for that first kiss.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Pony and Simini already know each other.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; she agreed, &#x201c;and they&#x2019;ve never gone out. Has Simini ever even <i>indicated</i> that she&#x2019;s interested?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sometimes people need help,&#x201d; Noel said. &#x201c;I mean&#x2014;look at Pony.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags did. He was wearing black jeans and a black T-shirt. He had a half-grown-out mohawk now, but he&#x2019;d had a ponytail back in middle school, so everyone still called him that. Pony was usually loud and funny, and sometimes loud and obnoxious. He was always drawing on his arm with ink pens.</p> <p>&#x201c;That guy has no idea how to tell a girl he likes her,&#x201d; Noel said. &#x201c;None at all.&#x2026; Now, look at Simini.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags did. Simini was small and soft, and so shy that coming out of her shell wasn&#x2019;t even on the menu. If you wanted to talk to Simini, you had to climb inside her shell with her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not everyone has our social graces,&#x201d; Noel said, sighing, and leaning into Mags&#x2019;s space to gesture toward Pony and Simini. &#x201c;Not everyone knows how to reach out for the things they want. Maybe midnight is exactly what these two need to get rolling&#x2014;would you begrudge them that?&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags turned to Noel. His face was just over her shoulder. He smelled warm. And like some sort of Walgreens body spray. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being melodramatic,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Life-or-death situations bring it out in me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Like coffee table dancing?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, the strawberries,&#x201d; he said, sticking out his tongue and trying to talk around it. &#x201c;Duth it look puffy?&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags was trying to get a good look at Noel&#x2019;s tongue when the music dropped out.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost midnight!&#x201d; Alicia shouted, standing near the television. The countdown was starting in Times Square. Mags saw Pony look up from his phone and inch toward Simini.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Nine!&#x201d;</i> the room shouted.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Eight!&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;</i>Your tongue looks fine,&#x201d; Mags said, turning back to Noel.</p> <p>He pulled his tongue back in his mouth and smiled.</p> <p>Mags raised her eyebrows. She hardly realized she was doing it. &#x201c;Happy anniversary, Noel.&#x201d;</p> <p>Noel&#x2019;s eyes went soft. At least, she thought they did. &#x201c;Happy anniversary, Mags.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Four!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>And then Natalie ran over, slid down the wall next to Noel, and grabbed his shoulder.</p> <p>Natalie was friends with both of them, but she wasn&#x2019;t a <i>best</i> friend. She had caramel-brown hair, and she always wore flannel shirts that gapped over her breasts. &#x201c;Happy New Year!&#x201d; she shouted at them.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Mags said.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;One!&#x201d;</i> everyone else yelled.</p> <p>&#x201c;Happy New Year,&#x201d; Noel said to Natalie.</p> <p>Then Natalie leaned toward him, and he leaned toward her, and they kissed.</p> <p>Dec. 31, 2013, almost midnight</p> <p>Noel was standing on the arm of the couch with his hands out to Mags.</p> <p>Mags was walking past him, shaking her head.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; he shouted over the music.</p> <p>She shook her head <i>and</i> rolled her eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s our last chance to dance together!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s our senior year!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We have months left to dance,&#x201d; Mags said, stopping at the food table to get a mini quiche.</p> <p>Noel walked down the couch, stepped onto the coffee table, then stretched one long leg out as far as he could to make it onto the love seat next to Mags.</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re playing our song,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re playing &#x2018;Baby Got Back,&#x2019;&#x201d; Mags said.</p> <p>Noel grinned.</p> <p>&#x201c;Just for that,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m never dancing with you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You never dance with me anyway,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;I do everything else with you,&#x201d; Mags whined. It was true. She studied with Noel. She ate lunch with Noel. She picked Noel up on the way to school. &#x201c;I even go with you to get a haircut.&#x201d;</p> <p>He touched the back of his hair. It was brown and thick, and fell in loose curls down to his collar. &#x201c;Mags, when you don&#x2019;t go, they cut it too short.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not complaining,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just sitting this round out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you eating?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>Mags looked down at the tray. &#x201c;Some kind of quiche, I think.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can I eat it?&#x201d;</p> <p>She popped another one in her mouth and mushed it around. It didn&#x2019;t taste like tree nuts or strawberries or kiwi fruit or shellfish. &#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; she said. She held up a quiche, and Noel leaned over and ate it out of her fingers. Standing on the love seat, he was seven-and-a-half feet tall. He was wearing a ridiculous white suit. Three pieces. Where did somebody even find a three-piece white suit?</p> <p>&#x201c;S&#x2019;good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; He reached for Mags&#x2019;s Coke, and she let him have it&#x2014;then he jerked it away from his mouth and cocked his head. &#x201c;Margaret. They&#x2019;re playing our song.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags listened. &#x201c;Is this that Ke$ha song?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Dance with me. It&#x2019;s our anniversary.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like dancing with a bunch of people.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the best way to dance! Dancing is a communal experience!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;For you,&#x201d; Mags said, pushing his thigh. He wavered, but didn&#x2019;t fall. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not the same person.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Noel said with a sigh. &#x201c;<i>You</i> can eat tree nuts. Eat one of those brownies for me&#x2014;let me watch.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags looked at the buffet and pointed to a plate of pecan brownies. &#x201c;These?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Noel said.</p> <p>She picked up a brownie and took a bite. Crumbs fell on her flowered dress, and she brushed them off.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is it good?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Really good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Really dense. Moist.&#x201d; She took another bite.</p> <p>&#x201c;So unfair,&#x201d; Noel said, holding on to the back of the love seat and leaning farther over. &#x201c;Let me see.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mags opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue.</p> <p>&#x201c;Unfair,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That looks delicious.&#x201d;</p> <p>She closed her mouth and nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Finish your delicious brownie and dance with me,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;The whole world is dancing with you,&#x201d; Mags said. &#x201c;Leave me alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>She grabbed another quiche and another brownie, then put Noel behind her.</p> <p>There weren&#x2019;t that many places to sit in Alicia&#x2019;s basement; that&#x2019;s why Mags usually ended up on the floor. (And maybe why Noel usually ended up on the coffee table.) Pony had claimed the beanbag by the bar in the corner, and Simini was sitting on his lap. Simini smiled at Mags, and Mags smiled back and waved.</p> <p>There wasn&#x2019;t any booze in the bar. Alicia&#x2019;s parents put it away whenever she had a party. All the barstools were taken, so Mags got a hand from somebody and sat up on the bar itself.</p> <p>She watched Noel dance. (With Natalie. And then with Alicia and Connor. And then by himself, with his arms over his head.)</p> <p>She watched everybody dance.</p> <p>They had all their parties in this basement. After football games and after dances. Two years ago, Mags hadn&#x2019;t really known anybody in this room, except for Alicia. Now everybody here was either a best friend, or a friend, or someone she knew well enough to stay away from&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Or Noel.</p> <p>Mags finished her brownie and watched Noel jump around.</p> <p>Noel was her very best friend&#x2014;even if she wasn&#x2019;t his.

A small group of gawkers, two fishing guides and the couples who were their clients, gathered at his back. Moaning sounds emanating from the tree and willow tangle at the base of the cliffs were spaced farther apart now, just in the thirty minutes since he&#x2019;d driven up from Ennis. He&#x2019;d been sitting down to breakfast when he got the call. His day off, a date to meet Martha and cast a fly in the braids of the Madison, hence unarmed.</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, this being Montana and all, land of free men and open carry, I&#x2019;d think somebody would be packin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>If Martha was here she&#x2019;d have her Ruger, day off or not. Strapping up was part of her a.m. ritual, like turning Goldie out for a run while she steeped her tea, running a ChapStick across her lips and looking at her face critically in the mirror before squaring her hat. On nights when Harold slept over he&#x2019;d step up behind her, bring his big hands to her face, chestnut against white, lift the corners of her mouth so she saw herself smile.</p><p>&#x201c;I got a two-two.&#x201d;</p><p>Harold turned around. He&#x2019;d heard the crunch of gravel a few minutes before as another truck pulled up. It was Peachy Morris hauling his ClackaCraft, the one with the pink ribbon on the hull to show his support for breast cancer research, though anyone who knew Peachy knew the only breast research he was interested in was the hands-on kind. The lanky fishing guide crinkled up his eyes, a&nbsp;<i>What do we</i> <i>have here?&nbsp;</i>look on his face. Harold&#x2019;s glance took in Peachy&#x2019;s clients, a tall, sandy-haired man he recognized as a member of the Madison River Liars and Fly Tiers Club, though he had forgotten the name, and a small girl who looked maybe seven.</p><p>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; Harold asked the girl.</p><p>The girl hid her face behind a wing of straw-colored hair.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m Indian,&nbsp;</i>he thought. When she&#x2019;d boldly pronounced her armament, he&#x2019;d been facing away from her.</p><p>The sandy-haired man extended his hand. &#x201c;Robin Hurt Cowdry. We&#x2019;ve met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. You&#x2019;re from Zimbabwe, you import the African artifacts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Botswana,&#x201d; the man corrected. &#x201c;Mugabe redistributed my keister all the way to Botswana. This is Doris, my niece.&#x201d; And to the girl, &#x201c;Mind your manners.&#x201d;</p><p>She shyly faced Harold. &#x201c;You can have my two-two,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s back at the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I might need something bigger than that,&#x201d; Harold said. His eyes turned to the cliffs as the moaning picked up in volume.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like a bloody pride of lions,&#x201d; Cowdry said.</p><p>Harold&#x2019;s nod was half an inch. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bison. Guy on the Tenderfoot Creek game range saw them on the escarpment last night, maybe a part of the herd that came out of Yellowstone onto the Hebgen Plateau, reported it to Fish, Wildlife, and Parks this morning. A guide putting in heard the ruckus&#x201d;&#x2014;Harold jerked his head to indicate the group standing at the boat ramp&#x2014;&#x201c;so he called the county and here I am with my hands in my pockets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you figure they fell over the cliffs?&#x201d; Peachy Morris was tugging on his rowing gloves. &#x201c;Fourth of July. All that racket down in the valley, people setting off fireworks. They could have panicked.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m thinking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then let me see what I can come up with.&#x201d;</p><p>Harold crossed his arms against the bite of morning chill, caught the girl staring at his tattoos, the weasel tracks hunting around his left upper biceps, the hooves of elk following each other around his right.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you an Indian?&#x201d; she said, pushing the hair out of her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen an Indian.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Harold said.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw a Zulu warrior dance. They&#x2019;re fiercer than you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because I didn&#x2019;t put on my paint this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Peachy was back, handing over a revolver in a leather holster.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a .454 Casull. The loads are just snake shot, but there&#x2019;s some hard cast rounds floating around in my boat bag. Shoot through thirty inches of wet phone books.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Jah, you could right donner them with that. Couldn&#x2019;t he, Uncle Robin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speak American, Dorry,&#x201d; Cowdry said.</p><p>Morris produced five hard cast loads with the comment that they might not be enough. &#x201c;How many you think there are?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like a few.&#x201d; Harold tipped out the cylinder to eject the snake loads and fed in the full-power rounds. He turned to Cowdry. &#x201c;I left a message with the sheriff. She comes, she&#x2019;ll have donuts. Tell her to save me one of the glazed. Make sure your niece gets one.&#x201d;</p><p>He raised his chin to the guide. &#x201c;Peachy, you think you could row me across?&#x201d;</p><p>He spoke briefly to the group who&#x2019;d been standing on the bank, telling them to wait until he&#x2019;d crossed before launching and to stay in their boats until they were through the cliffs. He left them stringing fly rods and pushed off with Peachy at the oars of the driftboat, making for a backwater on the far bank.</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to come with you?&#x201d; Peachy dropped the anchor.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I got it.&#x201d;</p><p>Harold ran his eyes to the tops of the cliffs, which were known as the Palisades and stood sentinel for a solid mile over the river&#x2019;s west bank. The moaning sounds were louder here and sounded more like growling, though the reverberation on the rock walls made them hard to place. He drew the Casull from the holster to double-check the loads. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be needing this,&#x201d; he said, and tossed the holster to Peachy. He started hiking up the bank, holding the heavy handgun at his side.</p><p>The first buffalo was dead, a jagged edge of cannon bone sticking through the skin of its foreleg, its bowels evacuated, its enormous eye glazed over. A cow, fingers of shaggy winter coat hanging off it like brown moss. The cow had rolled after falling off the cliff, carving a wide swale through the brush. Twenty yards farther up, where willows choked the river bottom, was a second cow. Its cavernous rib cage expanded, then collapsed like an accordion. With each exhalation, a ragged gurgling sound blew bubbles in the blood covering its nose and mouth. Its eye followed Harold as he walked around it, but it lacked the strength to turn its head. Harold clenched his jaw. He extended his right arm and shot it in the back of its skull.</p><p>At the shot, Harold&#x2019;s arm jerked up and back, spinning him halfway around. He brought the barrel down out of recoil, feeling a sharp pain in his shoulder from the wrenching of his arm. Jesus, the thing was a cannon. His ears ringing, he sat down beside the dead bison. The roaring of other bison had become an undertone, dull and muted from the concussion. Eventually the underwater sensation subsided and the sounds of the dying animals came back.</p><p>Harold tucked his braid under the back of his shirt and fought through brush. He climbed until he reached the base of the cliffs, which was scree rock and sagebrush studded about with giant slabs of stone that had broken away from the cliff face. The rattling, guttural sighs seemed to surround him. He found another dead cow and then three bison still clinging to life, two of them lying down, one on its knees, feebly pushing its short horns against the withers of one of the fallen animals. Harold tore strips from his bandana and wadded them into his ears. He looked away for a few moments, putting off the inevitable. Then he grasped the rubberized grips of the revolver with both hands, extending his arms, and shot the bison that was on its knees. It rolled over and was still. He moved a few feet, sat down, and shot the next one, and then the third. The great heads rocked with the impacts and the moaning stopped.</p><p>Harold got to his feet. He pulled the cotton out of his ears. Except for the river running, he heard nothing, and the relative silence seemed oppressive. That must be the lot, he thought. He had gone a long way inside himself to find that still place where the hunter went when he killed, had gone so far as to regard the bison as &#x201c;it&#x201d; rather than he or she, something no Indian would do without conscious decision for they were his brothers, his sisters, and only now did he take in a bigger picture. Harold was Blackfeet, his people were buffalo people, nomads who had followed the herds until there were no more herds to follow. For thousands of years his ancestors had driven bison over cliffs similar to those above him. In fact, Harold thought, it was entirely likely that they had driven bison over these very cliffs, for this had been a Blackfeet hunting ground and the cliffs formed what was called a&nbsp;<i>pishkun&nbsp;</i>in the tribal language, a &#x201c;deep blood kettle.&#x201d; But that was before the white man came with his seeds and his cattle, before the Sharps rifles spoke and the Sun Dances held on the reservation became only ceremony.</p><p>Harold squatted on his heels, facing the river. He watched the occasional car pass by on the highway, a quarter mile to the east. If you lifted your eyes it was Eden as his grandfather&#x2019;s grandfathers had seen it, the mountains uncolored by time. The irony of what he had done, killing the first bison to have returned to these ancient hunting grounds in one hundred and fifty years, was not lost on him, and the tears that hung on the high bones of his cheeks were the tears of his people. He ignored them as a white, boxy-looking vehicle slowed and turned onto the access road. That would be Martha&#x2019;s Cherokee. Well, he&#x2019;d better get back across and give her the news.</p><p>The slope he&#x2019;d climbed earlier was choked with willow and alder, and he looked for an easier route down to the river. To his right the gradient eased, and he&#x2019;d descended a few yards when he saw the bushes above him bulging and heard a sound like rocks clashing. The head of a bison emerged from the brush, strings of bloody mucus hanging from its nostrils. It was striking its hooves against the stone scree, pawing it. The bison was thirty feet away and it came in a stumbling charge. A bull, its great hump standing taller than Harold&#x2019;s head, coming on three good legs, one rear leg flopping. Harold cocked the hammer on the last round in the Casull and held his fire. Twenty feet, ten, the bison&#x2019;s head dropping to toss him with its thick, incurved horns. Harold brought the muzzle level with its forehead and pulled the trigger, then jumped to the side as the bull fell heavily, its nose plowing into the scree. For a moment it lay still. Then, slowly, it began to slide down the hill. It picked up speed, rolled over once, and came to rest against the trunk of a limber pine tree.</p><p>Harold had felt the earth shake as the bison fell, and now he couldn&#x2019;t feel his feet underneath him. Where he&#x2019;d been standing, blood painted the stones. He worked his way down to where the beast lay dead, into the envelope of its heavy odor, into their collective past. The underwater sensation was back and he shook his head. Such a magnificent animal. Such a waste of life.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when he heard the bleating. It was not loud, but higher-pitched than the moaning he&#x2019;d heard earlier. He knew it must be a calf. He thought about going back to the landing, waiting for Martha, borrowing her .357 to finish it off.</p><p><i>No, do it now. Get it over with.&nbsp;</i>He reached for the bone-handled knife on his hip.</p></p><h2>RV Repair &amp; Maintenance Manual</h2><p><p>RV Repair and Maintenance Manual is the most popular resource for owners who prefer to work on their own RVs.

Ribbon pagemarker. Published for the Shakespeare Head Press by Barnes and Noble.</p><p>William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&#39;s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England&#39;s national poet and the &#34;Bard of Avon&#34;. His surviving works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.</p><h2>Force of Nature: The Life of Linus Pauling</h2><p>Tracing the career of Linus Pauling, one of the century&#39;s greatest American scientists and the only person to win two unshared Nobel prizes, a meticulouly researched chronicle shows how Pauling revolutionized chemistry and examines his controversial politics. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Thomas Hager, Director of the Office of Communications at the University of Oregon, is a former contributing editor of American Health and correspondent for the Journal of the American Medical Association.By any measure, Linus Pauling is an influential and interesting figure in twentieth-century science and medicine. This book documents, not only his life, but also the development of science in the United States and the rich cross-fertilization among various scientific disciplines and medical research. Because of his strong belief in peace and the fundamental freedoms of speech and association, Pauling's activities during the McCarthy era offer a unique view of the role and power of government and the courage of those who, like Pauling, were steadfast in their beliefs. Jonathan Reese's reading is somewhat stiff, giving the presentation the feel of a black-and-white documentary. Despite this, and the length of the book, it's well worth the undertaking for its portrait of this complex and intriguing man and for its historical value.

This memoir (written in 1939 but only published now for the first time) begins in 1914 when the family summer holiday is cut short by the outbreak of war, and ends with Hitler&#39;s assumption of power in 1933. It is a portrait of himself and his own generation in Germany, those born between 1900 and 1910, and brilliantly explains through his own experiences and those of his friends how that generation came to be seduced by Hitler and Nazism. The Germans lacked an outlet for self-expression: where the French had amour, food and wine, and the British their gardens and their pets, the Germans had nothing, leading to a tendency towards mass psychosis. The upheaval of post-WWI revolution, factionalism and inflation left the Germans addicted to excitement and action: Hitler provided this, and more.</p><p>What was it about Germany that made the rise of Adolf Hitler and his murderous regime possible? That troubling question has occupied many fine minds over the last six decades, few more lucid and thoughtful than the late historian and journalist Sebastian Haffner. In this book, drawn from a manuscript he did not live to complete, Haffner examines the social and cultural conditions that made Germany ill-equipped for democracy and ripe for totalitarianism. Among these, Haffner writes, were a generational war between an apathetic adult population and a youth "familiar with nothing but political clamor, sensation, anarchy, and the dangerous lure of irresponsible numbers games"; a fatal fondness for the winner-and-loser dichotomy of sports and a rage for spectacle and entertainment; a resignation through which ordinary people came to "adapt to living with clenched teeth, in a manner of speaking," rather than stand up in protest. In that climate, Haffner--who left Germany just before World War II broke out--suggests, Nazism was almost an inevitability, against which he, too, tried to withdraw into "a small, secure, private domain," like so many others of his time and place. An important eyewitness account, Haffner's book deepens our understanding of how small missteps can lead to tragic ends, and how nations can be led into chaos. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Sebastian Haffner (orig. Raimund Pretzel) was born in 1907 in Berlin. He emigrated to England in 1938, and changed his name to protect his relatives in Germany from persecution. He wrote for the OBSERVER for many years, and became a British citizen in 1948. He returned to Germany in 1954, where he was a prominent journalist and historian, writing for DIE WELT and STERN. He died in 1999.</p><h2>All Other Nights: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A gripping epic about the great moral struggles of the Civil War.</strong></p> How is tonight different from all other nights? For Jacob Rappaport, a Jewish soldier in the Union army, it is a question his commanders have answered for him: on Passover in 1862 he is ordered to murder his own uncle, who is plotting to assassinate President Lincoln.After that night, will Jacob ever speak for himself? The answer comes when his commanders send him on another mission&#x2015;this time not to murder a spy but to marry one.A page-turner rich with romance and the history of America (North and South), this is a book only Dara Horn could have written. Full of insight and surprise, layered with meaning, it is a brilliant parable of the moral divide that still haunts us: between those who value family first and those dedicated, at any cost, to social and racial justice for all.</p><p>Dara Horn is a two-time winner of the National Jewish Book Award for Fiction and one of Granta&#x2019;s Best American Novelists. She lives in New Jersey with her husband and four children.Without any need for sound effects or other audio enhancements, William Dufris&#39;s narration of this Civil War novel skillfully re-creates the era. He adeptly renders both Northern and Southern accents. With only the inflections of his voice, Dufris makes real the cacophony of battle, the sounds of a slave auction, and the refined tones of a Southern drawing room. Historic figures like Judah Benjamin are authentically, if unsympathetically, presented. Author Dara Horn artfully depicts the milieu--the story takes place mostly in New Orleans and Richmond, Virginia--and mayhem of war-torn America. Espionage, murder, even marriage under false pretenses highlight this fast-paced audiobook.

She tries to suppress it, bites her lip, brings herself under the flimsiest tether of control.<br><br>Isabel draws aside the bedspread, struggles to a sitting position. It&#x2019;s been hours since she has shifted her body in any appreciable way, and her legs and back are stiff and achy--old, if she had to choose a word for her joints. Her legs dangle over the side of the mattress, her toes searching for the fleece-lined slippers.<br><br>Along the wall, long slivers of aluminum shelves--hundreds of horizontal feet--are filled with neat stacks of manuscripts, their authors&#x2019; names written with thick black Sharpie into the sides of the stacks of pages. Tens of thousands of pages of proposed books of every sort, promising a wide assortment of entertainment and information, produced with a broad range of skill levels.<br><br>These days, everyone younger than Isabel seems to read manuscripts and proposals on e-readers; quite a few of those older, too. But she feels uncomfortable, unnatural, sitting there holding a little device in her hands. Isabel is of the generation that&#x2019;s just old enough to be congenitally uncomfortable with new technologies. When she started her first job, she didn&#x2019;t have a computer at her desk. A year later, she did.<br><br>Maybe next year she&#x2019;ll start using one of those things, but for now she&#x2019;s still reading on paper, turning pages, making notes with pens, surrounding herself with stacks of paper, like bricks, bunkered against the relentless onslaught of the future. And for The Accident, she didn&#x2019;t even have a choice. Because although nearly all of new projects are now delivered to her office electronically, this submission was not.<br><br>She shuffles down the hall, through the darkness. Turns on the kitchen lights, and the coffee machine--switched from AUTO-ON, which is set to start brewing an hour from now, to ON--and the small television. Filling the silent lonely apartment with humming electronic life.<br><br>Isabel had been reading frantically, hoping to discover the one assertion that rang untrue, the single mismatched thread that would unravel the whole narrative, growing increasingly discouraged as page 1 at the office in the morning became page two-hundred-something at home in the evening. She fell asleep sometime after eleven, more than halfway through, then woke again at two, unable to quiet her mind, anxious to get back to it. People in the book business are constantly claiming &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t put it down&#x201d; or &#x201c;it kept me up all night&#x201d; or &#x201c;I read it in one day.&#x201d; This time, all that was true.<br><br>So at two a.m. Isabel picked up the manuscript and started reading again, page after page, through the late-late night. Vaguely reminiscent of those days when Tommy was an infant, and she was sleep-deprived, awake in a dormant world. They are very discrete periods, for very specific reasons, when it&#x2019;s a normal part of life to be awake at four a.m.: it&#x2019;s for making babies or caring for them, in the small desperate hours when a blanket of quiet smothers the city, but through the moth-eaten holes there&#x2019;s the occasional lowing of a railroad in New Jersey, the distant Dopplered wail of an ambulance siren. Then the inevitable thump of the newspaper on the doormat, the end of the idea of night, even if it&#x2019;s still dark out.<br><br>Nothing she encountered during the 488 pages seemed false. Now she stares at the anchor&#x2019;s face on the television, tuned to Wolfe . . . That goddamned son of a bitch . . . <br><br>Her anger swells, and she loses control--<br><br>Isabel cocks her arm and hurls the remote across the kitchen, cracking and splintering against the refrigerator door, clattering loudly to the floor. Then the heightened silence of the aftermath, the subdued thrum of a double-A battery rolling across the tile, the impotent click as it comes to rest against a baseboard.<br><br>She feels tears trickling down her cheek, and wipes them away.<br><br>The coffee machine hisses and sputters the final drops, big plops falling into the tempered glass. Isabel glances at the contraption&#x2019;s clock, changing from 5:48 to 5:49, in the corner of the neatly organized counter, a study in right angles of brushed stainless steel. Isabel is a passionate proponent of perfect alignment. Fanatical, some might say.<br><br>She opens the refrigerator door, with its new scratch from the airborne remote, whose jagged pieces she kicks out of her way. She takes out the quart of skim and pours a splash into her mug. She grabs the plastic handle of the carafe and fills the mug with hot, viscous, bitter, bracing caffeination. She takes a small sip, then a larger one. She tops up the mug, and again wipes away tears.<br><br>She walks back down the now-lighted hall, lined with the family photographs she&#x2019;d unearthed when she was moving out of her matrimonial apartment, into this single-woman space in a new neighborhood, far from the painful memories of her home--of her life--downtown, where she&#x2019;d been running into too many mothers, often with their children. Women she&#x2019;d known from the playgrounds and toy stores and mommy-and-me music classes, from the gyms and grocers and coffee shops, from preschool drop-off and the pediatrician&#x2019;s waiting room. All those other little children growing older, getting bigger, Emmas and Stellas in precious little plaids, Ashers and Amoses with mops of messy curls in skinny jeans on scooters; all those self-satisfied downtown bobo parents, unabashedly proud of their progeny&#x2019;s precociousness.<br><br>She&#x2019;d bought herself a one-bedroom in a full-service uptown co-op, the type of apartment that a woman chooses when she becomes reconciled that she&#x2019;s not going to be living with another human being. She had reached that age, that stage, when a lifestyle starts to look permanent: it is what it is, and ever will be, until you die. She was making her loneliness as comfortable as possible. Palliative care.<br><br>If she wasn&#x2019;t allergic to cats, there&#x2019;d probably be a couple of them lurking around, scrutinizing her disdainfully.<br><br>Isabel lined this nice new hallway--parquet floors, ornate moldings, electrical outlets where she wants them--with framed photos. There she is, a smiling little toddler being held aloft by her tragically beautiful mother in Central Park, at the playground near the museum, a couple of blocks from the Classic 8 on Park Avenue that her parents couldn&#x2019;t actually afford. And then hand-in-hand with her remarkably unambitious father, starting fourth grade at the small-town public school in the Hudson Valley, after they&#x2019;d finally abandoned the city for their &#x201c;country place,&#x201d; the old family estate that they&#x2019;d been selling off, half-acre parcels at a time, to pay for their life. Then in cap and gown, the high school valedictorian, bound not for Harvard or Yale or even a first-rate state school, but for a second-tier--maybe third?--private college upstate, because it offered a full scholarship, including room and board, and didn&#x2019;t necessitate expensive out-of-state travel. The drive was just a few hours.<br><br>Her parents had called her Belle; still do. But once she was old enough to understand what the word meant, she couldn&#x2019;t bear to lay claim to it. She began to insist on Isabel.<br><br>Isabel had intended to go to graduate school, to continue studying American literature, eventually to teach at the university level, maybe. But that plan was formed before she&#x2019;d had an understanding of the realities of personal finance. She took what she thought would be a short-term job at a publishing house--one of her father&#x2019;s school chums was a famous editor--with the irrational expectation that she&#x2019;d be able to save money to pay for school, in a year, or two. She was buoyed by modest success in an enjoyable workplace during good business years, and one thing led to another. Plus she never saved a dime. By the time she was twenty-five, she no longer thought about grad school. Almost never.<br><br>So then there she is, in a little black dress on stage at a book-award ceremony, accepting on behalf of her author who was in South America at the time, chasing a new story. And in a big white dress, aglow, in the middle of the panoramic-lens group shot, the thirty-six-year-old bride with her bridesmaids, at her wedding to a man she&#x2019;d started dating a mere eight months earlier, short on time, perfectly willing to turn a blind eye to his obvious faults, the personality traits that her friends were too supportive to point out, until the safe remove of hindsight.<br><br>That utter bastard.<br><br>It still amazes her how quickly youth slipped away, how severely her options narrowed. Just a couple of bad relationship decisions--one guy who as it turned out was never going to commit, another who was a closeted asshole--and the infinite choices of her late twenties turned into the dwindling selection of her mid-thirties, now saying yes to any non-creepy men who asked her out at parties or introduced themselves in bars, sometimes using her middle name if the guy was on the margins of acceptability and she might end up wanting to hide behind the unstalkable shield of an alias; over the years she&#x2019;d had more than a few dates with men who thought her name was something else. Half the time, she was glad for the deception.<br><br>Another photo, a smaller print, lying in the hospital bed with Tommy in her arms, tiny and red and angry in his striped swaddling blanket and blue cap. Isabel returned to work after the standard three months, but in that quarter-year something had passed, and she was complacent to allow it. Her husband was suddenly making embarrassing amounts of money, so Isabel hired a housekeeper to go with the nanny. She started leading one of those enviable-looking lives--a four-day workweek, driving the shiny car from the pristine loft to the shingled beach house, a perfect baby and a rich handsome smart funny husband . . . <br><br>And then.<br><br>She stops at the final photo, spotlit, a small black-and-white in the center of an expanse of stark-white matting. A little boy, laughing on a rocky beach, running out of the gentle surf, wearing water wings. Isabel reaches her hand to her lips, plants a kiss on her fingers, and transfers the kiss to the little boy. As she does every morning.<br><br>Isabel continues to the bathroom, unbuttoning her flannel top as she walks, untying the drawstring of the pajama bottoms, which crumple as she releases the knot. She pushes her panties down and steps out of them, leaving a small, tight puddle of cotton on the floor.<br><br>The hot shower punishes her tense, tired shoulders. Steam billows in thick bursts, pulled out the bathroom door, spilling into the dressing area, the bedroom. The water fills her ears, drowning out any sounds of the television, of the world. If there&#x2019;s anything else in her apartment making noise, she can&#x2019;t hear it.<br><br>What exactly is she going to do with this manuscript? She shakes water out of her hair, licks her top lip, shifts her hands, her feet, her weight, standing under the stream, distracted and disarmed, distressed. It all beats down on her, the shower stream and the manuscript and the boy and the past, and the old guilt plus the new guilt, and the new earth-shattering truths, and fear for her career and maybe, now, fear for her life.<br><br>She slips into a soft, thick white bathrobe, towel-dries her hair. She sweeps her hand across the steamed-up glass, and examines her tired eyes, bagged and bloodshot, wrinkled at the corners. The bathroom&#x2019;s high-voltage lighting isn&#x2019;t doing her any favors this morning. She had long ago become accustomed to not sleeping well, for a variety of reasons. But with each passing year, it has become harder and harder to hide the physical evidence of sleeplessness.<br><br>From the other room, she can hear the irrelevant prattle of the so-called news, the piddling dramas of box-office grosses, petty marital indiscretions, celebrity substance abuse. Steam recolonizes the mirror, and she watches big thick drops of condensation streak down from the top beveled edge of the glass, cutting narrow paths of clarity through the fog, thin clear lines in which she can glimpse her reflection . . . <br><br>Something is different, and a jolt of nervous electricity shoots through her, a flash of an image, Hitchcockian terror. Something in that slim clear streak has changed. The light has shifted, there&#x2019;s now a darkness, a shadow--<br><br>But it&#x2019;s nothing, she sees, just the reflection of the bedroom TV, more footage of yesterday&#x2019;s international news, today. Today she has to consider the news in a whole new light. Now and forevermore.<br><br>She gets dressed, a sleek navy skirt suit over a crisp white blouse, low heels. The type of office attire for someone who wants to look good, without particularly caring about being fashionable. She blow-dries, brushes her shoulder-length blonde hair, applies makeup. Sets contacts into her hazel eyes. She assesses herself--tired-looking, inarguably middle-aged--in the full-length mirror, and sighs, disappointed. Three hours of sleep pushes the limit of what makeup can accomplish.</p><h2>Poisoned: The True Story of the Deadly E. Coli Outbreak That Changed the Way Americans Eat</h2><p>In POISONED, Jeff Benedict delivers a jarringly candid narrative of the fast-moving disaster drawing on access to key documents and exclusive interviews with the real-life characters at the center of the drama - the families whose children were infected, the Jack in the Box executives forced to answer for the tragedy, the physicians and scientists who identified E. coli as the culprit, and the legal teams on both sides of the historic lawsuits that ensued. This is the story of the permanent transformation of our food supply chain, and the young maverick lawyer, Bill Marler, who staked his career on bringing the victims justice without compromise. Fast Food Nation meets A Civil Action in this riveting account of how we learned the hard way to truly watch what we eat.</p><p>Jeff Benedict is an award-winning writer and is considered one of America s top investigative journalists. He has published nine critically acclaimed books, including Little Pink House, Without Reservation, Pros and Cons, Out of Bounds, and The Mormon Way of Doing Business. He is a columnist and feature writer for SI.com and a contributor to Sports Illustrated. His essays and articles have also appeared in the New York Times, Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times, and the Hartford Courant. His stories have been the basis of a documentary on the Discovery Channel, as well as segments on 60 Minutes, 20/20, Dateline, and HBO s Real Sports.

Campbell award finalist,&nbsp;and the author of the highly acclaimed <i>Coldfire</i> <i>Trilogy,</i> <i>New York</i> <i>Times</i> Notable Book of the Year <i>This Alien Shore</i>, <i>In Conquest Born</i>, <i>The Madness Season</i>, <i>The Wilding</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Magister</i> <i>Trilogy</i>.&nbsp; Ms. Friedman worked for twenty years as a professional costume designer, but retired from that career in 1996 to focus on her writing. She lives in Virginia, and can be contacted via her website, www.csfriedman.com.This closing volume of Friedman's Coldfire trilogy (When True Night Falls; Black Sun Rising) ably concludes one of the better fantasy series in recent memory. Even readers unfamiliar with the earlier volumes will quickly be enmeshed in the struggles of the Reverend Damien Vryce and The Hunter, Gerald Tarrant, to maintain the order of the planet Erna against the forces of the demon Calesta. The battle is made more complicated in this volume by the development of an allegiance between Calesta and Andrys Tarrant, a descendant of Gerald's who vows vengeance on his ancestor. Andrys is a bit too inept to ever seem threatening, however, and a bit too lacking in joie de vivre to come off as a classic Pretender/Fool. But the sections without Andrys, especially those focusing on The Hunter, are interesting enough, and as the final battles?involving The Church, The Hunter, the forces of Calesta and various people and factions whose alignments vary throughout the novel?are held around The Hunter's keep, readers will be enthralled. While Friedman introduces a science fictional raising-of-the-stakes gambit here that isn't entirely satisfying, her general mastery of her material should delight her fans. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sunday School in HD: Sharpening the Focus on What Makes Your Church Healthy</h2><p><p>Ministry professional Allan Taylor writes to all church leaders about the crucial role that Sunday School must play in producing healthy Christians who in turn produce healthy churches. He emphasizes the value of the Sunday School model to the total church ministry for its superior ability to nurture relationships and more personally stir passion for the Great Commission across every age group.</p><p>Taylor presents the sharply focused idea that all Sunday School programs are either imploding (through directionless ineffectiveness) or exploding (thanks to visionary leadership and practicing some fundamental disciplines). As such, he guides the reader toward growth principles that must be operative for any church to begin or continue a transformational Sunday School boom.</p></p><p><b>Allan Taylor</b> is the minister of education at First Baptist Church in Woodstock, Georgia, where Sunday School attendance has grown from 2,500 to 5,000 under his leadership.

But will Tacky ever be able to learn the synchronized moves and win the contest?</p><p><p><b>Helen Lester </b>has written many hilarious and popular picture books, including the Tacky the Penguin series and <i>Hooway for Wodney Wat. </i>She lives in New York. www.helenlester.com</p>As in Tacky the Penguin , deftly delivered humor reinforces the message that there is nothing wrong--and quite a bit right--with being different. The book's pithy text and winsome pictures are equally entertaining, and together immediately endear the "odd bird" Tacky to readers. His penguin cohorts--the appropriately named Goodly, Lovely, Angel, Neatly and Perfect--all dressed in starched white collars and natty bow ties. In droll contrast, Tacky's garb is, well, what his name suggests: his Hawaiian shirt is topped by a floppy, checkered bow tie. When a Penguin Cheering Contest is announced, Tacky's pals are determined to win the grand prize--shiny blue bow ties. Youngsters will laugh sympathetically at the out-of-step penguin's attempts to master the cheers that the others (now wearing matching blue sweaters and beanies) perform so gracefully. Though he finally learns the routine, Tacky resorts to his old clumsy self on the day of the competition--much to the enjoyment of the terribly bored judges. What the champion cheerer does with his new bow tie is typically Tacky--and delightfully different.

Only H.P. Lovecraft could conjure up these testaments to evil that will live inside of you forever....</p><p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890 &#x2013; 1937) &#x2014; known as H.P. Lovecraft &#x2014; was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and only published in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. In 1913 his conduct of a long running controversy in the letters page of a story magazine led to his being invited to participate in an amateur journalism association. Encouraged, he started circulating his stories; he was 31 at the time of his first publication in a professional magazine. By age 34, he was a regular contributor to newly founded Weird Tales magazine. In 1926 he produced some of his most celebrated tales including "The Call of Cthulhu". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, he subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46.</p><h2>The Book of Sorrows</h2><p>This sequel to the award-winning The Book of the Dun Cow stands on its own as a powerful work of literature. In this absorbing, highly original fantasy, Chauntecleer, Pertelote, and the other familiar characters of the Coop struggle to piece together their shattered lives in the aftermath of the terrible conflict with the dreaded Wyrm. But their respite is short-lived: Into this struggling community, Wyrm again insinuates himself, with dire consequences for all. The reappearance of the dog Mundo Coni unveils a darker mystery yet -- and the threat of a final horror when evil yields up its most devastating secrets. Told by a master storyteller, The Book of Sorrows is a taught and spellbinding tale that immerses readers in a variety of adventures -- heroic, humorous, and touching -- moving inexorably toward the final confrontation that decides the fate of the characters and their world. No one who reads it will remain unmoved. It explores the value and goodness of existence, the darker side of reality, and qualities of love, kindness, courage, and hope that can transform even &#34;this troublous existence.&#34; Here is fast-paced fantasy filled with richly drawn characters and gripping excitement, set against a colorful, fully realized world, and with depth of meaning that will draw readers back again and again to ponder the images long after the final battle is waged between the forces of life and death.</p><p>Walter Wangerin Jr. first came to prominence as the award-winning author of The Book of the Dun Cow.

A Smart Girl&#39;s Guide To Surviving Tricky, Sticky, Icky Situations</h2><p>Girls will learn to take charge and feel confident in a variety of tough situations, from being threatened by a bully to getting caught in an earthquake to falling down the stairs at school. Problem-solving strategies and tips from experts empower girls, and warm writing and humorous illustrations keep the book&#39;s tone light.</p><p>Grade 4-8-For the most part, the entries in this book hit the mark, with advice about such predicaments as not getting along with one's teacher or being caught doing something wrong. There's the lighthearted (what to do if you fall down stairs in front of people) and also the deadly serious (what to do "if you fall through ice"). Friends figure often, among them those who want to copy homework or who tell others the name of your crush. At times, however, the featured situations will have limited applicability, such as "how not to fall off a horse." And some readers may not be highly interested in how to remove various stains from carpet and clothing. That said, the last advice is a statement of empowerment: "You can stand on your own two feet. You've got a good brain. You've got common sense. Keep them handy. Trust yourself. You'll be able to handle just about anything." That advice alone makes the book worthy of purchase.

Moore has had unique access to all of Thatcher&#x2019;s private and governmental papers, and interviewed her and her family extensively for this book. Many of her former colleagues and intimates have also shared previously unseen papers, diaries, and letters, and spoken frankly to him, knowing that what they revealed would not be published until after her death. The book immediately supersedes all other biographies and sheds much new light on the whole spectrum of British political life from Thatcher&#x2019;s entry into Parliament in 1959 to what was arguably the zenith of her power&#x2014;victory in the Falklands in 1982. <br><br> Drawing on an extraordinary cache of letters to her sister Muriel, Moore illuminates Thatcher&#x2019;s youth, her relationship with her parents, and her early romantic attachments, including her first encounters with Denis Thatcher and their courtship and marriage. Moore brilliantly depicts her determination and boldness from the very beginning of her political career and gives the fullest account of her wresting the Tory leadership from former prime minister Edward Heath at a moment when no senior figure in the party dared to challenge him. His account of Thatcher&#x2019;s dramatic relationship with Ronald Reagan is riveting. This book also explores in compelling detail the obstacles and indignities that Thatcher encountered as a woman in what was still overwhelmingly a man&#x2019;s world. <br><br> Moore&#x2019;s admiration for Thatcher is evident, yet his portrait is convincingly clear-eyed, conveying both how remarkable she was and how infuriating she could be, her extraordinary grasp at mastering policy and what needed to be done, and her surprising vulnerabilities. At the moment when Margaret Thatcher becomes a part of history, Moore&#x2019;s portrait enlivens her, compellingly re-creating the circumstances and experiences that shaped one of the most significant world leaders of the postwar era.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Guest Review of &#x201c;Margaret Thatcher&#x201d;</b></p><p></p><p><b>By Anne Applebaum</b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Anne Applebaum is the author of several books, including <i>Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe</i>, a National Book Award finalist, and <i>Gulag: A History</i>, which won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. She writes a column for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Slate</i>, and is the Director of Political Studies at the Legatum Institute in London. She divides her time between Britain and Poland, where her husband, Radek Sikorski, serves as Foreign Minister.</strong></p> <p>From the beginning she sounded different. She looked different too, particularly back when she had frizzy hair and wore too much jewelry...</p> <p>Much has happened since then. She became the Iron Lady, she became prime minister, she became a symbol to love or hate, she became an &#x201c;ism&#x201d;...We all think we know what happened to her and why&#x2014;but do we really?</p> <p>Moore&#x2019;s great gift is his ability to make Thatcher&#x2019;s story fresh again, and above all to remind us of how odd she was. By beginning at the beginning, by showing us the reality of the childhood we only know through clich�s&#x2014;&#x201c;grocer&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201d; &#x201c;scholarship girl&#x201d;&#x2014;by introducing us to the boyfriends we&#x2019;ve never met and by quoting from her chatty, breathless letters to her sister (&#x201c;I decided to buy a really nice undie-set to go under my turquoise chiffon blouse&#x201d;) Moore shows us how impossible it would have been for anyone who knew her as a young woman to imagine what she would become.</p> <p>He also captures her unsettling personality, her &#x201c;actressy&#x201d; manner, her stiffness in public, her private warmth, her inept outbursts and faux pas, almost always using the language of people who were there at the time. During the decade and a half he worked on this authorized biography&#x2014;of which this is only the first volume&#x2014;Moore had unprecedented access to her private papers, on condition that nothing be published until after her death. He interviewed just about everyone who knew Thatcher, from her private secretaries to her political enemies, and he did so meticulously. This enabled Moore to produce not a hagiography or a court biography, as some feared he would, but a multi-faceted picture of a compelling and unusual life.</p> <p>Moore is at his best when presenting different views of the same situation. Some of these contradictory impressions are explained by the fact that she was female in an almost entirely male world. In later years, many assumed she had no interest in other women or awareness of herself as a role model, but Moore shows over and over again that this was not the case.</p> <p>Her oddity was also connected to her brilliance, another one of her qualities now lost beneath layers of history and controversy. Thatcher got to Oxford from Grantham not because she had connections but because she worked incredibly hard, even overcoming objections from a teacher who told her to forget Oxford because &#x201c;you haven&#x2019;t got Latin.&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Latin&#x201d; and went to take lessons from a Latin teacher at a local boy&#x2019;s school. Later, she passed the Bar exam after studying tax law on her own.</p> <p>The same autodidactic instinct impelled her to study economic and political theory. Although this is very much a narrative biography, it is also a thematic book about ideas: where they come from, how they affect people and how they get shaped into policies. And Thatcher proved unusually receptive to what were then very unfashionable ideas. In the summer of 1968, when the rest of the world was turning on and dropping out, she was in her suburban sitting room reading library books on Conservative political philosophy.</p> <p>In the end, this combination of biography and intellectual history works perfectly. After all, Thatcher&#x2019;s ideas were shaped by the place where she was born, by the people she met, by Oxford in the 1940s and Finchley in the 1950s, by her quirkiness and her brilliance, by her provinciality and her romantic choices. To understand what happened to Britain during her prime ministership and afterwards, it really is important to understand who she was: Moore&#x2019;s Thatcher will now become the definitive account.</p>Charles Moore was born in 1956 and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read history. He joined the staff of <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in 1979, the year Margaret Thatcher came to power, and as a political columnist in the 1980s, he covered several years of Thatcher&#x2019;s first and second governments. From 1984 to 1990 he was editor of <i>The</i> <i>Spectator</i>; from 1992 to 1995, editor of <i>The</i> <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>; and from 1995 to 2003, editor of <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, for which he is still a regular columnist.

A samurai turned priest does battle with the floating severed heads of ravenous goblins.<br> These are just some of the haunting tales culled by distinguished American scholar, translator, and journalist Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904) during years of travel and study in his adopted land of Japan. The twenty \"ghostly sketches\" Hearn gathered for his classic collection Kwaidan (or \"strange stories\") span the supernatural spectrum from grisly accounts of revenge from beyond the grave to haunting visions of beautiful snow spirits who bring quiet death in the night. Strange and wondrous creatures abound in these tales, including human-faced Heik� crabs who embody the spirits of dead warriors, and the jikininki, or man-eating goblins that feed nocturnally on funeral offerings.<br> In Hearn's vivid retellings of classic Japanese folk tales - further enhanced in this gorgeous, heavily illustration gift edition -- the spirit world swirls frighteningly close to human reality, the border between the two often being no more than a thin fog of dreams.</p><p></p><h2>Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>Why are more American adolescent girls prey to depression, eating disorders, addictions, and suicide attempts than ever before? According to Dr. Mary Pipher, a clinical psychologist who has treated girls for more than twenty years, we live in a look-obsessed, media-saturated, "girl-poisoning" culture. Despite the advances of feminism, escalating levels of sexism and violence--from undervalued intelligence to sexual harassment in elementary school--cause girls to stifle their creative spirit and natural impulses, which, ultimately, destroys their self-esteem. Yet girls often blame themselves or their families for this "problem with no name" instead of looking at the world around them.<br><br>Here, for the first time, are girls' unmuted voices from the front lines of adolescence, personal and painfully honest. By laying bare their harsh day-to-day reality, <b>Reviving Ophelia</b> issues a call to arms and offers parents compassion, strength, and strategies with which to revive these Ophelias' lost sense of self.</p><p>At adolescence, says Mary Pipher, &#34;girls become &#39;female impersonators&#39; who fit their whole selves into small, crowded spaces.&#34; Many lose spark, interest, and even IQ points as a &#34;girl-poisoning&#34; society forces a choice between being shunned for staying true to oneself and struggling to stay within a narrow definition of female. Pipher&#39;s alarming tales of a generation swamped by pain may be partly informed by her role as a therapist who sees troubled children and teens, but her sketch of a tougher, more menacing world for girls often hits the mark. She offers some prescriptions for changing society and helping girls resist.&#x201c;An important book . . .

During World War II he served in Europe as a U.S. Army intelligence officer, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. After the Nuremberg trials, Taylor practiced law in New York City, taught at Columbia Law School and the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law, and published a number of books, including<em> Munich: The Price of Peace</em>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for best nonfiction work of 1979.The chief prosecutor of the four-power Nuremberg trials (1945-1946) delivers the ultimate insider's account of the war-crimes prosecution of surviving Nazi leaders. A National Book Critics Circle Award winner for Munich: The Price of Peace , Taylor explains how the Allied governments established the legal basis for the tribunal and organized the courtroom proceedings. He introduces the defendants--Goring, Hess, Ribbentrop, Speer et al.--defines the charges against them, outlines the evidence and recounts individual defense strategies, closing arguments, judicial sentences and (in the case of those condemned to death) the details of their executions. Taylor casts doubt on the legality of the charges against Nazi publisher Julius Streicher and argues that Rudolf Hess, mentally incapable of defending himself, should not have been tried. (Incidentally, he clears up the intrigue surrounding how former Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goring managed to conceal the cyanide capsule with which he committed suicide.) This gripping eyewitness report of an unprecedented international military tribunal is the definitive work on the subject.

A Neiman Fellow, he has also worked for <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> and <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>.<b>Prologue</b><p>Joan Ganz Coney walked toward the corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, lost in a fog of grief. Ahead were the crenelated parapets that crown the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a Gothic Revival Glory on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Black limousines lined the curbside, clogging the street, as NYPD officers waved their arms in a futile effort to get vehicles moving. The sidewalks were overrun by pedestrians, hundreds of them, all moving toward the cathedral steps. Cooney walked alongside mothers with toddlers clutching Ernie dolls, students playing hooky from school, executives in crisp suits, Midtown secretaries in heels, Latinas in scoop-necked tops, and bohemian types sporting jeans, running shoes, and long ponytails. </p><p>It was May 21, 1990, five days after Jim Henson, her friend and creative partner since 1969, had died from a runaway strep infection gone stubbornly, foolishly untreated. There was no other word to describe his passing other than shocking, and it was played just that way in the papers and on the nightly news. People who didn't know him wept as if a favorite uncle had died, that subversive adult who sat with the adults at Thanksgiving but would have preferred dinner at the kids' table. They came out in force for the public memorial, filling the vast, vaulted sanctuary, even more than the organizers of the event had anticipated. Some five thousand attendees filled the pews, standing in the antechamber and spilling into the aisles. The overflow was so great that people had simply dropped their backpacks, folded up their strollers, and sat on the hard stone floor.</p><p>Clustered row upon row near them were mourners bound by their years together working for and with the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the nonprofit corporation Cooney helped build. Cooney took a seat next to Christopher Cerf, one of the founding fathers of "Sesame Street." </p><p>From the alter, the congregation was an impressionistic canvas, dappled with a profusion of spring green. That was to be expected. Just as teams, tribes, and nations have representative colors, Jim Henson owned Kermit green. </p><p>Cooney's thoughts wandered to Kermit and the early days of "Sesame Street." Reminders of that time were everywhere. Sitting nearby was Frank Oz, who in 1969&#x2014;Sesame's debut year&#x2014;became a Henson prot�g�, having joined the Muppets right out of high school. For more than twenty years, Oz had been uptight Bert to Henson's mischievous Ernie, the straight man of the odd-couple comedy duo. On "The Muppet Show," their roles had reversed; Oz was outrageously pushy Miss Piggy to Henson's pushed-on-the-brink Kermit.</p><p>At no time had Jim Henson's disparate worlds collided quite as markedly as at this memorial. Over to one side was Henson's friend Harry Belafonte. A humanitarian and artist, Belafonte had appeared on "The Muppet Show", where he introduced "Turn the World Around," a joyous, syncopated African folk melody that would be part of the day's program.</p><p>Not far away was Lorne Michaels, who gave the Muppets a weekly showcase during the audacious first season (1975) of "Saturday Night Live" at a time when the ambitious Henson feared he might be trapped for eternity in children's television. Henson's talent manager, Bernie Brillstein, saw to it that that never happened. Brillstein, who signed John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, and Gilda Radner, was like a second father to Henson, a Jewish one.</p><p>In the late 1980's, Henson had separated from his wife, Jane, the mother of his five children. For most of his career, he had been more married to his work than to Jane, and a relationship that began when they met as students at the College Park campus of the University of Maryland withered. Henson was known to work around the clock in the studio when a production deadline loomed, and his travel schedule and a list of business commitments would have seemed unreasonable to most. He seemed happier and more fulfilled away from home, but he craved time with his two sons and three daughters.</p><p>As a single man, Henson had his pick of staggeringly beautiful companions. Daryl Hannah, who had flown in from California for the service on a private jet and now wept softly in a pew, had been one of them. Henson went through a Hollywood stage in his late forties and early fifties, shedding his bohemian wardrobe for goods from Rodeo Drive. His beard was neatly trimmed and his hair styled for an appearance he'd made with Kermit on the late-night Arsenio Hall Show, just two days before he died. Complaining of a sore throat in the greenroom that day, he was uncharacteristically flat and slow on the uptake during the interview segment. Henson used the occasion to plug an upcoming special shot at Disney World in Orlando and to introduce Clifford, a new Muppet musician working with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, the house band from The Muppet Show. African American puppeteer Kevin Clash gave voice and performance to Clifford, he of the fuchsia dreadlocks, sunglasses, and vocal delivery that was distinctly urban contemporary. Clash was sensational, bantering with the black comic as the audience howled.</p><p>Henson seemed to enjoy it as much as anyone, and he looked relieved to have Clash carry the load. It was Henson's final televised interview.</p><p>Chris Cerf lost a dear friend and comic collaborator in Henson. Walking into the memorial, he was numb with grief, but being surrounded by his CTW colleagues was a comfort. Only months earlier, "Sesame Street" composer-arranger extraordinaire Joe Raposo had been laid to rest, dead at age fifty-one from complications of lymphoma. </p><p>Cerf composed tunes for "Sesame Street" as well, half-silly, half-sophisticated parody numbers. As the son of Bennett Cerf, the witty cofounder of Random House, Chris had used his book-world DNA to create the first paperback library of "Sesame Street" books. He was also sly and unpredictable, which made him a perfect fit for Henson's extended family of mirth makers. Cerf provided many good times in Sesame's freewheeling formative days, when an elaborate prank would reduce Henson to a puddle.</p><p>Cooney knew that everything about "Sesame Street" had been unalterably turned upside town the minute Jim Henson was declared dead at 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 16.</p><p>In his final hour, he twice went into cardiac arrest, as the raging infection shut down his organs and left him struggling for air, surrounded by strangers. The cause of his death was Group A streptococcal pneumonia, an infection that probably started with that sore throat he complained about in Los Angeles the night of the Arsenio taping. A timely course of penicillin would have saved him, but he chose not to seek medical help until it was too late. Henson, whose mother was a practicing Christian Scientist, had considered calling a faith healer, but, after hours of feverish decline, he finally acceded to be taken to the hospital. Around 4 a.m., Henson's publicist Arthur Novell received a phone call in San Francisco. "Oh Arthur, I'm not feeling well," Henson rasped. Sensing danger, Novell arranged for a Manhattan car service to pick up Henson at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel. Henson, whose organs were failing, walked to the lobby and got into the limo. Precious minutes were lost as the driver pulled up to a door at New York Hospital that was three-quarters of a block away from the emergency entrance. More time was lost when Henson sent the driver on his way, insisting he could walk to the ER. There was no arguing with him. For all his exceptional attributes, Henson was a willful, unyielding man who almost always got his way. This served him well in business, where he could wear people down.</p><p>Jim Henson was a genius, and not only for reinventing puppetry for the television age and for inspiring a raft of characters that make you smile just thinking about them. Henson was a genius businessman, as well. His only flaws might have been an inability to stay within budget for his feature-length films and his unwillingness to fire people when prudence would have suggested he should do so. He always found someone else to take that responsibility.</p><p>"Puppetry," he once said, "is a way of hiding." At six foot three and perpetually bearded to cover acne scars, Henson was defined by bemusing and often baffling contradictions. He was shy by nature, yet his creations were explosively silly and spontaneous. Often reticent and contemplative, at times he eagerly played the Pied Piper, organizing one of New York's most outrageous annual costume parties. He spoke of simple pleasures but had a taste for European casinos, costal vacation homes, and four-star dining. He lived large but, as a proto-environmentalist, talked of protecting a small planet's shrinking resources. He embraced and celebrated life exuberantly and spread acres of joy but suffered through at least one major depression after his fantasy film, <i>The Dark Crystal</i>, bombed at the box office and was dismissed by&nbsp;critics.</p><p>Henson was deeply unhappy and fatigued in the months leading up to his death. Many believed he sensed that he would not live to see grandchildren, pointing to a plan he had drawn up five years earlier for the public memorial service as evidence that he believed the end was near. It was included in letters left behind for each of his children, in which Henson indicated a burning curiosity about the afterlife and an eagerness to reconnect with the dead, and assured the children that he would be waiting for them "on the other side." He also asked his survivors to bring everyone together for a few songs and stories, insisting that guests avoid wearing funeral black. As a son of the South and a jazz fancier, he requested that a New Orleans-style band play "When the Saints Go Marching In." He requested that the proceedings be entertaining and light, hoping that friends and colleagues would provide laughter in large doses and silliness worthy of the Muppets. </p><p>Henson wrote the letter three years before he began working&#x2014;without a contract&#x2014;for The Walt Disney Company. Doing so, some believe, was the beginning of the end.</p><p>Disney CEO Michael D. Eisner waited for the proceedings to begin alongside Frank Wells, his No. 2 at the company. In the late 1980's, Eisner had been clever enough to see that Disney's cast of classic characters aimed at the very young, such as Mickey Mouse and Goofy, were being slowly supplanted in children's hearts by fresher, hipper icons. Eisner and Wells had pledged a huge pile of Disney dollars&#x2014;a sum estimated to be between $100 million and $150 million&#x2014;to purchase Henson's production company and library of film and television properties. The price included ownership of the boisterous, satirical, and sometime sardonic puppet ensemble that had made The Muppet Show a worldwide sensation, but it did not&#x2014;and would not&#x2014;include the Muppets Henson had specifically created for "Sesame Street." </p><p>Henson believed there was no entertainment company better suited than Disney to perpetuate such multidimensional characters as Miss Piggy, the porcine diva; Fozzie Bear, the clueless comic; and hectoring balcony critics Statler and Waldorf. Disney's litigious history of protecting its characters in the stuff of Hollywood legend. Under Eisner, the company once sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over an unauthorized Oscar appearance by an actress portraying Snow White. </p><p>Cooney knew Eisner to be cold, arrogant, and insistent when he was in pursuit of a creative property. She was not pleased with his predatory forays into "Sesame Street." Her gut churned as she considered how miserable Eisner had made things for Henson in his final months. Henson's gentle manner masked a steely shrewdness&#x2014;you could not budge him if he didn't want to be budged&#x2014;but Eisner had been surprisingly relentless in the Henson campaign. Cooney&#x2014;a courteous woman who had persuaded senators and top philanthropists to do her bidding, who had stared down cancer, and who was married to a private-equity mogul who could quite possibly arrange to buy the entire Disney company if push came to shove&#x2014;was not intimidated by his tactics. </p><p>Cooney held Disney in high regard but regarded the company's merchandising arms as competitors in the marketplace of character-licensed toys, games, and consumer goods. She was convinced that Eisner would not be satisfied until his deal with Henson was sweetened by ownership of the Sesame Muppets, which generated an estimated $15 million to $17 million annually in licensing and merchandising fees split between Sesame Workshop and Henson Associates, Inc. In 1969, Henson had waived his performance fee for "Sesame Street" in exchange for full ownership of his characters, agreeing later to split any revenue generated by them.</p><p>In time, both organizations depended on that revenue for survival. By 1990, CTW had long shed its dependence on government and philanthropic grants, gaining its financial independence by building and sustaining a formidable endowment. Henson Associates, notorious for going over budget on productions, stayed afloat thanks to the huge popularity of its characters and the public's hunger for Muppet-licensed bed linens, apparel, computer games, action figures, books, CDs, and other products.</p><p>By 1989, after building his company from a husband-and-wife operation out of the trunk of his car into one of the world's most recognized entertainment brands. Henson was eager to return to a simpler existence of creating and performing. Disney had offered a way to cash out, and a letter of intent, by which he would have sold his privately held company to the California-based entertainment and media colossus, was already signed.</p><p>But after months of legal process, during which Henson had commenced working for Disney without a consummated deal, lingering doubts began to plague him. As media analysts were hailing the merger-in-progress as "a business association made in entertainment heaven," discord bubbled just beneath the surface at Disney Studios in Florida and California. Henson's employees, accustomed to his benevolence, creative freedom, and camaraderie, were suffering from massive culture shock in their day-to-day dealings within Disney's rapacious negotiate-everything hierarchy. They referred to their new working environment as Mauschwitz. </p><p>Beyond that, Henson was beginning to chafe at provisions in the deal for his exclusive personal services and for the rights to any future characters he might create. These were not unreasonable demands from a company about to dump an armored carload of cash at his door. But regret clearly was setting in for a man who valued creative freedom and independence how Henson felt, and she believed the whole situation was causing him immense grief and contributing to his lack of physical resistance. Henson felt that he would be Disney's highly compensated but indentured servants for the rest of his life. </p><p>What the business-page pundits and entertainment insiders never quite sniffed out about the stalled marriage had its roots in Eisner's covetous yen for the Sesame Muppets. Despite Henson's refusals to discuss the matter, Eisner wouldn't let up. Cooney recalled how early in the winter of 1990, Henson had invited her to attend what he described as a peace luncheon with Eisner, at which he wanted to put the m...</p></p><h2>Where Memories Lie (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels, 12)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Chilling and humane....Skillful and subtle....A deeply moving novel that transcends genre.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x2014;<i>Richmond Times Dispatch</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A sinister mystery that leads all the way back to the Holocaust ensnares Scotland Yard detectives Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James in <i>Where Memories Lie from award-winning &#x201c;masterful novelist&#x201d; (<em>Denver Post</em>) Deborah Crombie.

But Matthiessen (The Snow Leopard, etc.) uses a clinical, detached voice to narrate his epic treks to Antarctica, making what should be a gripping page-turner a bland yawn. It's not his fault that a wicked storm limited his journey to the White South, disrupting the natural apex of the trip's trajectory. But Matthiessen would have been more effective in conveying the magnitude of his experiences if he had used words-not latitude and longitude coordinates-to narrate the action. He vaguely compensates for his stoicism by liberally citing and quoting from his Antarctic forebears, especially Ernest Shackleton and Roald Amundsen. This historical context is appreciated, particularly after slogging through languorous descriptions of animals, objects and elements that lack personification (a necessary tool when making "nature" the subject, protagonist and plot line of a book). Statements like, "Birds call us into the moment," made by an associate of Matthiessen's (but equally indicative of Matthiessen's philosophy) are not evocative hallmarks of the Antarctic quest, one of the most complex, majestic and challenging journeys that exist. Although he succeeds in prioritizing nature over narrative arc, it remains frustrating that such an accomplished author would not, in his 27th book, find a way to liven up antiseptic observations of albatrosses and hurricanes with an expansive, emotive voice befitting the scope of his travels. 8-page color photo insert not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander)</h2><p>Eagerly anticipated by her legions of fans, this sixth novel in Diana Gabaldon&#x2019;s bestselling Outlander saga is a masterpiece of historical fiction from one of the most popular authors of our time.<br><br>Since the initial publication of <i>Outlander</i> fifteen years ago, Diana Gabaldon&#x2019;s <i>New York Times</i> bestselling saga has won the hearts of readers the world over &#x2014; and sold more than twelve million books.

But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence &#x2014; with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from <i>The Wilmington Gazette</i>, dated 1776, which reports Jamie&#x2019;s death, along with his kin.

Had it been daylight, I&#x2019;d never ha&#x2019; kent it, never.&#x201d; He wiped a trembling hand over his face, unable to take his eyes off the line of bodies that lay at the edge of the forest. &#x201c;Was it savages, Mac Dubh? They&#x2019;re no scalped, but maybe&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Jamie laid the soot-smeared handkerchief gently back over the staring blue face of a small girl. &#x201c;None of them is wounded. Surely ye saw as much when ye brought them out?&#x201d;<br><br>Lindsay shook his head, eyes closed, and shivered convulsively. It was late afternoon, and a chilly spring day, but the<br>men were all sweating. &#x201c;I didna look,&#x201d; he said simply. My own hands were like ice; as numb and unfeeling as the<br>rubbery flesh of the dead woman I was examining. They had been dead for more than a day; the rigor of death had passed off, leaving them limp and chilled, but the cold weather of the&nbsp;mountain spring had preserved them so far from the grosser indignities of putrefaction. Still, I breathed shallowly; the air was bitter with the scent of burning. Wisps of steam rose now and then from the charred ruin of the tiny cabin. From the corner of my eye, I saw Roger kick at a nearby log, then bend and pick up something from the ground beneath. Kenny had pounded on our door long before daylight, summoning us from warm beds. We had come in haste, even knowing that we were far too late to offer aid. Some of the tenants from the homesteads on Fraser&#x2019;s Ridge had come, too; Kenny&#x2019;s brother Evan stood with Fergus and Ronnie Sinclair in a small knot under the trees, talking together in low-voiced Gaelic.<br><br>&#x201c;D&#x2019;ye ken what did for them, Sassenach?&#x201d; Jamie squatted&nbsp;beside me, face troubled. &#x201c;The ones under the trees, that is.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded at the corpse in front of me. &#x201c;I ken what killed this puir woman.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s long skirt stirred in the wind, lifting to show long, slender feet shod in leather clogs. A pair of long hands<br>to match lay still at her sides. She had been tall&#x2014;though&nbsp; not so tall as Brianna, I thought, and looked automatically for my daughter&#x2019;s bright hair, bobbing among the branches on the far side of the clearing. I had turned the woman&#x2019;s apron up to cover her head and upper body. Her hands were red, rough-knuckled with work, and with callused palms, but from the firmness of her thighs and the slenderness of her body, I thought she was no more than thirty&#x2014;likely much younger. No one could say whether she had been pretty.<br><br>I shook my head at his remark.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she died of the burning,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;See, her legs and feet aren&#x2019;t touched. She must have fallen into the<br>hearth. Her hair caught fire, and it spread to the shoulders of her gown. She must have lain near enough to the wall or the chimney hood for the flames to touch; that caught, and then the whole bloody place went up.&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie nodded slowly, eyes on the dead woman.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, that makes sense. But what was it killed them, Sassenach? The others are singed a bit, though none are burned like this. But they must have been dead before the cabin caught alight, for none o&#x2019; them ran out. Was it a deadly illness, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. Let me look at the others again.&#x201d;<br><br>I walked slowly down the row of still bodies with their cloth-covered faces, stooping over each one to peer again beneath the makeshift shrouds. There were any number of illnesses that could be quickly fatal in these days&#x2014;with no<br>antibiotics to hand, and no way of administering fluids save by mouth or rectum, a simple case of diarrhea could kill<br>within twenty-four hours.<br><br>I saw such things often enough to recognize them easily; any doctor does, and I had been a doctor for more than twenty years. I saw things now and then in this century that I had never encountered in my own&#x2014;particularly horrible parasitical diseases, brought with the slave trade from the tropics&#x2014; but it was no parasite that had done for these poor souls, and no illness that I knew, to leave such traces on its victims. All the bodies&#x2014;the burned woman, a much older woman, and three children&#x2014;had been found inside the walls of the flaming house. Kenny had pulled them out, just before the roof fell in, then ridden for help. All dead before the fire started; all dead virtually at the same time, then, for surely the fire had begun to smolder soon after the woman fell dead on her hearth?<br><br>The victims had been laid out neatly under the branches of a giant red spruce, while the men began to dig a grave<br>nearby. Brianna stood by the smallest girl, her head bent. I came to kneel by the little body, and she knelt down across from me.<br><br>&#x201c;What was it?&#x201d; she asked quietly. &#x201c;Poison?&#x201d;<br><br>I glanced up at her in surprise.<br><br>&#x201c;I think so. What gave you that idea?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded at the blue-tinged face below us. She had tried to close the eyes, but they bulged beneath the lids, giving the little girl a look of startled horror. The small, blunt features were twisted in a rictus of agony, and there were traces of vomit in the corners of the mouth. <br><br>&#x201c;Girl Scout handbook,&#x201d; Brianna said. She glanced at the men, but no one was near enough to hear. Her mouth twitched, and she looked away from the body, holding out her open hand. &#x201c;Never eat any strange mushroom,&#x201d; she quoted.<br><br>&#x201c;There are many poisonous varieties, and distinguishing one from another is a job for an expert. Roger found these, growing in a ring by that log over there.&#x201d;<br><br>Moist, fleshy caps, a pale brown with white warty spots, the open gills and slender stems so pale as to look almost<br>phosphorescent in the spruce shadows. They had a pleasant, earthy look to them that belied their deadliness.<br><br>&#x201c;Panther toadstools,&#x201d; I said, half to myself, and picked one gingerly from her palm. &#x201c;Agaricus pantherinus&#x2014;or that&#x2019;s<br>what they will be called, once somebody gets round to naming them properly. Pantherinus, because they kill so swiftly&#x2014; like a striking cat.&#x201d;<br><br>I could see the gooseflesh ripple on Brianna&#x2019;s forearm, raising the soft, red-gold hairs. She tilted her hand and spilled the rest of the deadly fungus on the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;Who in their right mind would eat toadstools?&#x201d; she asked, wiping her hand on her skirt with a slight shudder.<br><br>&#x201c;People who didn&#x2019;t know better. People who were hungry, perhaps,&#x201d; I answered softly. I picked up the little girl&#x2019;s hand,<br>and traced the delicate bones of the forearm. The small belly showed signs of bloat, whether from malnutrition or postmortem changes I couldn&#x2019;t tell&#x2014;but the collarbones were sharp as scythe blades. All of the bodies were thin, though not to the point of emaciation.<br><br>I looked up, into the deep blue shadows of the mountainside above the cabin. It was early in the year for foraging, but there was food in abundance in the forest&#x2014;for those who could recognize it.<br><br>Jamie came and knelt down beside me, a big hand lightly on my back. Cold as it was, a trickle of sweat streaked his<br>neck, and his thick auburn hair was dark at the temples. <br><br>&#x201c;The grave is ready,&#x201d; he said, speaking low, as though he might alarm the child. &#x201c;Is that what&#x2019;s killed the bairn?&#x201d; He<br>nodded at the scattered fungi. &#x201c;I think so&#x2014;and the rest of them, too. Have you had a look around? Does anyone know who they were?&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Not English; the clothes are wrong. Germans would have gone to Salem, surely; they&#x2019;re clannish souls, and no inclined to settle on their own. These were maybe Dutchmen.&#x201d; He nodded toward the carved wooden clogs on the old woman&#x2019;s feet, cracked and stained with long use. &#x201c;No books nor writing left, if there was any to begin with. Nothing that might tell their name. But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They hadn&#x2019;t been here long.&#x201d; A low, cracked voice made me look up. Roger had come; he squatted next to Brianna, nodding toward the smoldering remains of the cabin. A small garden plot had been scratched into the earth nearby, but the few plants showing were no more than sprouts, the tender leaves limp and blackened with late frost. There were no sheds, no sign of livestock, no mule or pig. <br><br>&#x201c;New emigrants,&#x201d; Roger said softly. &#x201c;Not bond servants; this was a family. They weren&#x2019;t used to outdoor labor, either;<br>the women&#x2019;s hands have blisters and fresh scars.&#x201d; His own broad hand rubbed unconsciously over a homespun knee; his palms were as smoothly callused as Jamie&#x2019;s now, but he had once been a tender-skinned scholar; he remembered the pain of his seasoning.<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder if they left people behind&#x2014;in Europe,&#x201d; Brianna murmured. She smoothed blond hair off the little girl&#x2019;s forehead, and laid the kerchief back over her face. I saw her throat move as she swallowed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll never know what happened to them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Jamie stood abruptly. &#x201c;They do say that God protects fools&#x2014;but I think even the Almighty will lose patience<br>now and then.&#x201d; He turned away, motioning to Lindsay and Sinclair.<br><br>&#x201c;Look for the man,&#x201d; he said to Lindsay. Every head jerked up to look at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Man?&#x201d; Roger said, and then glanced sharply at the burned remnants of the cabin, realization dawning. &#x201c;Aye&#x2014;<br>who built the cabin for them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The women could have done it,&#x201d; Bree said, lifting her chin.<br><br>&#x201c;You could, aye,&#x201d; he said, mouth twitching slightly as he cast a sidelong look at his wife. Brianna resembled Jamie in<br>more than coloring; she stood six feet in her stockings and had her father&#x2019;s clean-limbed strength.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps they could, but they didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Jamie said shortly. He nodded toward the shell of the cabin, where a few bits of<br>furniture still held their fragile shapes. As I watched, the evening wind came down, scouring the ruin, and the shadow<br>of a stool collapsed noiselessly into ash, flurries of soot and char moving ghostlike over the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; I stood and moved beside him, looking into the house. There was virtually nothing left inside, though the chimney stack still stood, and jagged bits of the walls remained, their logs fallen like jackstraws.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no metal,&#x201d; he said, nodding at the blackened hearth, where the remnants of a cauldron lay, cracked in two<br>from the heat, its contents vaporized. &#x201c;No pots, save that&#x2014; and that&#x2019;s too heavy to carry away. Nay tools. Not a knife, not an ax&#x2014;and ye see whoever built it had that.&#x201d;<br><br>I did; the logs were unpeeled, but the notches and ends bore the clear marks of an ax. Frowning, Roger picked up a long pine branch and began to poke through the piles of ash and rubble, looking to be sure. Kenny Lindsay and Sinclair didn&#x2019;t bother; Jamie had told them to look for a man, and they promptly went to do so, disappearing into the forest. Fergus went with them; Evan Lindsay, his brother Murdo, and the McGillivrays began the chore of collecting stones for a cairn. <br><br>&#x201c;If there was a man&#x2014;did he leave them?&#x201d; Brianna murmured to me, glancing from her father to the row of bodies. "Did this woman maybe think they wouldn&#x2019;t survive on their own?&#x201d;<br><br>And thus take her own life, and those of her children, to avoid a long-drawn-out death from cold and starvation?<br><br>&#x201c;Leave them and take all their tools? God, I hope not.&#x201d; <br><br>I crossed myself at the thought, though even as I did so, I doubted it. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t they have walked out, looking for help? Even with children . . . the snow&#x2019;s mostly gone.&#x201d; Only the highest mountain passes were still packed with snow, and while the trails and slopes were wet and muddy with runoff, they&#x2019;d been passable for a month, at least.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found the man,&#x201d; Roger said, interrupting my thoughts. He spoke very calmly, but paused to clear his throat. &#x201c;Just&#x2014; just here.&#x201d;<br><br>The daylight was beginning to fade, but I could see that he had gone pale. No wonder; the curled form he had unearthed beneath the charred timbers of a fallen wall was sufficiently gruesome as to give anyone pause. Charred to blackness, hands upraised in the boxer&#x2019;s pose so common to those dead by fire, it was difficult even to be sure that it was a man&#x2014; though I thought it was, from what I could see.<br><br>Speculation about this new body was interrupted by a shout from the forest&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve found them, milord!&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone looked up from contemplation of this new corpse, to see Fergus waving from the edge of the wood.<br><br>&#x201c;Them,&#x201d; indeed. Two men, this time. Sprawled on the ground within the shadow of the trees, found not together, but<br>not far apart, only a short distance from the house. And both, so far as I could tell, probably dead of mushroom poisoning. <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no Dutchman,&#x201d; Sinclair said, for probably the fourth time, shaking his head over one body.<br><br>&#x201c;He might be,&#x201d; said Fergus dubiously. He scratched his nose with the tip of the hook he wore in replacement of his<br>left hand. &#x201c;From the Indies, non?&#x201d; One of the unknown bodies was in fact that of a black man. The other was white, and both wore nondescript clothes of worn homespun&#x2014;shirts and breeches; no jackets, despite the cold weather. And both were barefoot. <br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Jamie shook his head, rubbing one hand unconsciously on his own breeches, as though to rid himself of the<br>touch of the dead. &#x201c;The Dutch keep slaves on Barbuda, aye&#x2014;but these are better fed than the folk from the cabin.&#x201d; He lifted his chin toward the silent row of women and children. &#x201c;They didna live here. Besides . . .&#x201d; I saw his eyes fix on the dead men&#x2019;s feet. The feet were grubby about the ankles and heavily callused, but basically clean. The soles of the black man&#x2019;s feet showed yellowish pink, with no smears of mud or random leaves stuck between the toes. These men hadn&#x2019;t been walking through the muddy forest barefoot, that much was sure. <br><br>&#x201c;So there were perhaps more men? And when these died, their companions took their shoes&#x2014;and anything else of<br>value&#x201d;&#x2014;Fergus added practically, gesturing from the burned cabin to the stripped bodies&#x2014;&#x201c;and fled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, maybe.&#x201d; Jamie pursed his lips, his gaze traveling slowly over the earth of the yard&#x2014;but the ground was churned with footsteps, clumps of grass uprooted and the whole of the yard dusted with ash and bits of charred wood. It looked as though the place had been ravaged by rampaging hippopotami.<br><br>&#x201c;I could wish that Young Ian was here. He&#x2019;s the best of the trackers; he could maybe tell what happened there, at least.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded into the wood, where the men had been found.<br><br>&#x201c;How many there were, maybe, and which way they&#x2019;ve gone.&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie himself was no mean tracker. But the light was going fast now; even in the clearing where the burned cabin<br>stood, the dark was rising, pooling under the trees, creeping like oil across the shattered earth.<br><br>His eyes went to the horizon, where streamers of cloud were beginning to blaze with gold and pink as the sun set behind them, and he shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Bury them. Then we&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;<br><br>One more grim discovery remained. Alone among the dead, the burned man had not died of fire or poison. When<br>they lifted the charred corpse from the ashes to bear him to his grave, something fell free of the body, landing with a<br>small, heavy thunk on the ground. Brianna picked it up, and rubbed at it with the corner of her ap...</p></p><h2>Lineages of the Absolutist State</h2><p>The political nature of Absolutism has long been a subject of controversy within historical materialism. Developing considerations advanced in <i>Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism</i>, this book situates the Absolutist states of the early modern epoch against the prior background of European feudalism. It is divided into two parts. The first discusses the overall structures of Absolutism as a state-system in Western Europe, from the Renaissance onwards; and the difficult question of the relations between monarchy and nobility institutionalised by it, for which it suggests a general periodization. It then looks in turn at the trajectory of each of the specific Absolutist states in the dominant countries of the West&#x2014;Spain, France, England and Sweden, set off against the case of Italy, where no major indigenous Absolutism developed.<br><br>The second part of the work sketches a comparative prospect of Absolutism in Eastern Europe. It begins with an enquiry into the reasons why the divergent social conditions in the more backward half of the continent should have produced political forms apparently similar to those of the more advanced West. The peculiarities, as well as affinities, of Eastern Absolutism as a distinct type of royal state, are examined. The variegated monarchies of Prussia, Austria and Russia are surveyed, and the lessons asked of the counter-example of Poland. Finally, the structure of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans is taken as an external gauge by which the singularity of Absolutism as a European phenomenon is assessed. The work ends with some observations on the special position occupied by European development within universal history, which draws themes from both <i>Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism </i>and <i>Lineages of the Absolutist State</i> together into a single argument&#x2014;within their common limits&#x2014;as materials for debate.<br><br>Two postscript notes treat, respectively, the notion of the &#x2018;Asiatic mode of production,&#x2019; with particular reference to Islamic and Chinese history, and the experience of Japanese feudalism, as relevant controls for a study of the evolution of Europe up to the advent of industrial capitalism.</p><p><b>Perry Anderson</b> is the author of, among other books, <i>Spectrum, Lineages of the Absolutist State, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, Considerations on Western Marxism, English Questions, The Origins of Postmodernity</i>, and <i>The New Old World</i>.

Her husband went off to fight for the Union while her father and brother fought for the Confederates. While the men were gone, outliers raided Lydia&#39;s mother&#39;s home, assaulting her and stealing the livestock. A pregnant Lydia returned to her old home place to tend to her mother and brothers and sisters. When her labor began, the doctor was too inebriated to come, so Lydia&#39;s Aunt Tildy delivered the baby, who was turned the wrong way, causing brain damage. After the war, when Mark returned, Lydia learned he had been imprisoned. Her Mark was a changed man who dealt with demons from the war and harbored a deep hatred for the men who had raided Lydia&#39;s mother&#39;s home, blaming his son&#39;s mental problems on them. Through the years, Lydia had more children while dealing with her husband&#39;s alienation and cynicism, hoping that through her love, he would become the man he used to be.

He lives in the Dordogne and Washington, DC.1<br><br>It felt like the first morning of spring. The early sun was chasing the mist from the wooded hollows that sheltered the small streams flowing busily down to the River V�z�re. Drops of dew sparkled on the new buds that seemed to have appeared overnight on the bare trees. The air smelled somehow different, fresh and hopeful, and enlivened by the tuneful notes of a dozen different birdsongs. Excited by the change in scents and season, even after his early morning walk through the woods, Gigi the basset hound thrust his nose at the open window of the small police van that descended the steep and curving lane from his master&#x2019;s home. At the wheel, Bruno was singing a half-�remembered song about springtime in Paris. Vaguely thinking of the duties of the day that stretched before him, when rounding the last bend he was suddenly forced to brake.<br><br>For the first time in his memory, the quiet road ahead was blocked with a line of cars and tractors, their engines running and their drivers&#x2019; heads poking from windows. Some were out of their cars, looking at the road that led to St. Denis. Several were talking urgently into cell phones. In the distance a car horn sounded, swiftly joined by others in discordant chorus. As Bruno surveyed the scene his own phone began to ring. He checked the screen, recognized the name of Pierre, a neighbor who lived farther up the road. He ignored it, assuming Pierre would be calling to complain at being stuck in the jam ahead. There had to be an accident of some sort.<br><br>Bruno pushed aside the thought that he could have avoided this delay if he&#x2019;d stayed the night with Pamela, the English-woman he&#x2019;d been seeing since the autumn. She had called off the arrangement that he would dine with her and stay the night, saying she&#x2019;d finally secured an early morning appointment with the <i>mar�chal</i>, the traveling farrier who was to reshoe her horses. Pamela postponed their meetings too frequently for Bruno&#x2019;s comfort, and he was never quite sure whether she was cooling on their relationship or simply wary of commitment. They were to meet again that evening, he reminded himself, without feeling greatly reassured. He parked the van and climbed out to investigate. The best view of the long traffic jam was commanded by Alain, who kept a dairy farm farther up the road to Les Eyzies.<br><br>&#x201c;Geese&#x2014;�the road&#x2019;s full of ducks and geese,&#x201d; he called down to Bruno from his perch high on a tractor. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all over the place.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno heard the sound of rival honking as the geese called back in response to the car horns, and he quickly clambered up beside Alain to peer ahead. The traffic jam stretched as far up the road as he could see. Darting between the stalled cars were perhaps hundreds of ducks and geese, streaming through the woods on the side of the road and heading across it to settle in a broad pond that spread across the meadow, swollen by the spring rains.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Louis Villatte&#x2019;s farm, behind those woods,&#x201d; said Alain. &#x201c;A tree must have come down and broken his fence, let them all escape. There&#x2019;s over three thousand birds in there. Or rather, there used to be. Looks like he&#x2019;s lost a few to the cars too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you got his number?&#x201d; Bruno asked. Alain nodded. &#x201c;Call him, see if he knows his birds have escaped. Then go through those woods and see if you can help Louis block the gap in his fence. I&#x2019;ll try and sort this out here. Join you later.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno went back to his van, released Gigi, and walked with him down the road, brushing aside the drivers&#x2019; angry queries. A driver he knew was looking mournfully at a broken headlamp while a wounded goose lay half pinned under his car, honking feebly.<br><br>&#x201c;You grew up on a farm, Pierre,&#x201d; Bruno told him, rushing past. &#x201c;Put the poor devil out of its misery.&#x201d; Looking back, he saw Pierre bend to grip the goose behind its head and twist. The bird fluttered wildly and then went limp. Even when the farm boy grew up like Pierre to work in an accountant&#x2019;s office, he hadn&#x2019;t lost the skill.<br><br>When he came to the main grouping of birds, advancing in a jumbled column from the woods, Bruno saw that the road ahead was blocked by some stalled cars coming the other way. He briefly considered using Gigi to turn the birds back, but they would go off and cross the road elsewhere. There was no stopping this exodus, so he might as well try to speed it up and clear the road. He persuaded the leading cars in each queue to reverse a little to make a broader passage to let the birds pass freely across to the pond. Some drivers tried to argue, but he pointed out that the sooner he could stop the supply of ducks, the sooner the road would unblock. He left them grumbling and took Gigi into the trees, trotting past the trail of ducks and geese that was still pottering and waddling its way from the Villatte farm. Bruno smiled to himself, wondering if the birds felt a sense of escape or curiosity, of adventure triggered by the coming of springtime.<br><br>Louis and his wife were already at the huge hole torn in the fence. No tree had fallen, no tractor had ridden through the sturdy barrier of wooden posts and chicken wire that ringed the farm. Instead, whole fence posts had been hauled from the earth and the wire cut. With boards and old doors and cardboard boxes stuffed beneath an ancient tractor, Louis was trying to plug the gaps in the fence. His wife and eldest son were flapping their arms, and their dog was barking to shoo away the ducks and geese following their fellows toward the freedom of the woods.<br><br>Without being told, Gigi darted forward to help drive the birds back from the fence, and Bruno helped Alain to haul some branches from broken trees to seal the remaining gaps in the wire. Once the makeshift barrier was in place, Louis came forward to shake their hands. Gigi and Louis&#x2019;s dog sniffed politely at each other&#x2019;s tails and then sat beside each other, staring at any bird daring to approach.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been at this since daybreak,&#x201d; Louis said. &#x201c;You see how big this gap is? Some bastard ripped this fence down deliberately and did a good job of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we know who,&#x201d; added Sandrine, his wife. &#x201c;Look at this, stuck on the bits of the fence they didn&#x2019;t tear down.&#x201d; She handed Bruno a photocopied leaflet, sealed inside a transparent plastic envelope.<br><br>&#x201c;STOP cruelty to animals. Boycott foie gras,&#x201d; he read. There was a smudged photocopied image of a duck held down in a narrow cage. A flexible tube hanging from above was thrust into its mouth by an unidentified man who was stretching the duck&#x2019;s neck taut for the force-�feeding. At the bottom, it read &#x201c;<i>Contactez</i> <i>PETAFrance.com</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this PETA?&#x201d; asked Alain, peering over Bruno&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an American thing, maybe British, but it&#x2019;s growing in France. They made a big fuss up in Paris about battery chickens and veal, those calves kept in pens. Looks like they&#x2019;ve started running a campaign against foie gras.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s our livelihood,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;And we don&#x2019;t make foie gras, we just raise the birds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And look at this,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;The wire&#x2019;s been cut with proper cutters. This was organized.&#x201d; He showed Bruno the snipped strands of wire. &#x201c;Then they pulled it away somewhere, hiding the stretches of wire they cut. I sent the other boy out looking for it in the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;City bastards,&#x201d; grunted Alain. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know the first thing about the country and they come here like a bunch of terrorists and try to ruin people.&#x201d; He turned aside and spat. &#x201c;You find out who they are, Bruno, and we&#x2019;ll take care of the rest.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno ignored Alain&#x2019;s outrage on behalf of his fellow farmer. &#x201c;All the birds seem to be heading for that pond on the far side of the road,&#x201d; he told Louis. &#x201c;Have you got some way to round them up and bring them back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ring the food bell. That brings most of them running. And for the rest, I&#x2019;ve got some netting. That&#x2019;s how we usually round them up. I&#x2019;ll put them in the trailer and bring them back once I&#x2019;ve got this fence fixed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sooner the better, because they&#x2019;ve blocked the whole road into town,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what brought me here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Crazy birds,&#x201d; said Louis, grimacing in rueful affection. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got a perfectly good pond back in the field, but give them a sniff of someplace new and off they go.&#x201d; He gestured back beyond his house where already some of the ducks, frustrated at their efforts to escape through the newly sealed barrier, were splashing and paddling serenely in their old familiar pond.<br><br>A young boy of about ten labored toward them from the woods, proudly hauling a section of wire fence.<br><br>&#x201c;I found it, Papa,&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s more. I can show you where.&#x201d; His face broke into a grin at seeing Bruno, who taught him to play rugby in winter and tennis in summer. &#x201c;Bonjour, Monsieur Bruno.&#x201d; He dropped the fence and came forward to shake hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Bonjour, Daniel. Did you see or hear anything when this happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. The first I heard was when Papa woke us all up to come out and save the birds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard something, a duck call, a single one and then repeated, just before the cockerel started,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;So it must have been a bit before dawn. I remember thinking that&#x2019;s odd, because the ducks don&#x2019;t usually stir until after the hens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could it have been a lure, one of those hunter&#x2019;s calls?&#x201d; Bruno asked. &#x201c;Whoever cut the fence must have had some way to wake the birds and tempt them to move. They&#x2019;d have wanted them out before you and the family were awake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must have been something like that,&#x201d; Sandrine said. &#x201c;The birds tend to stick around the barn, waiting to be fed. They&#x2019;ve never gone off before, even when we had that storm that knocked part of the fence down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get back to the road and see that jam is cleared,&#x201d; said Bruno.<br><br>&#x201c;Before you go, what do you know about this PETA?&#x201d; asked Sandrine.<br><br>&#x201c;Not a lot, but I&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; Bruno replied. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve lost one or two birds to the cars, but not many.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those birds are worth six euros each to us,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t afford to lose any of them, what with the bank loan we have to pay until we sell this lot. What if those PETA people come again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll shoot the bastards,&#x201d; Louis said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take turns keeping watch, sit up all night if we have to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a right to protect your property with reasonable force, according to the law,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;But people interpret &#x2018;reasonable force&#x2019; in different ways. If you hear anything happening again, it&#x2019;s best you call me. Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t use a firearm or any kind of weapon. The best thing is to photograph them so we can identify who they are. If you have any lights you can rig up, or one of those motion detectors . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A camera won&#x2019;t do any good,&#x201d; said Alain. &#x201c;Even with photos the damn courts will take their side. They&#x2019;re all mad Greenies, the magistrates. Then there&#x2019;s those food inspectors and all the other rules and regulations, tying us up in knots.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I know who it is,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s those students at the archaeology site who came in last week, working on some dig with that German professor, over toward Campagne. They&#x2019;re all staying at the municipal campground. This time of year, they&#x2019;re the only strangers around here and you know what those students are like. They&#x2019;re all Greens now.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll check it out. See you later.&#x201d; Along the fence he saw the fluttering of another of the leaflets inside a plastic bag, one of the kind that could be sealed and used in freezers. He took out a handkerchief and gingerly removed the pins that held it to the wire. Forensics might get something from it. There were several more attached along the fence and he took another. He nodded at Alain. &#x201c;Do you want to come with me? You&#x2019;ll have to move your tractor.&#x201d;<br><br>As he reached the road, where the jam was steadily clearing itself, Bruno&#x2019;s phone rang again. He checked the screen, saw the name &#x201c;Horst,&#x201d; and this time he answered. Horst Vogelstern was the German professor of archaeology in charge of the student volunteers at the dig. For more than twenty years Horst had spent his vacations at a small house he owned on the outskirts of St. Denis. He ran digs in the V�z�re Valley that the local tourist board liked to proclaim as the cradle of prehistoric man. The first site of Cro-�Magnon man had been found in the valley over a hundred years earlier, and the famous cave paintings of Lascaux were farther up the river. It was a source of pride to Bruno that he lived in this valley that could claim the longest continuous human habitation of anywhere on earth.<br><br>Bruno had attended a couple of Horst&#x2019;s lectures, delivered in excellent if strongly accented French. He had visited his digs and read a couple of articles Horst had published in the popular monthly <i>Dossiers d&#x2019;Arch�ologie</i>. Normally a quiet man, Horst became passionate when he talked of his subject, the great mystery of the replacement of the Neanderthals by the Cro-�Magnons some thirty thousand years ago. Had it been violent? Did they interbreed? Were the Neanderthals wiped out by some plague or disease? It was, said Horst, the crucial question regarding our human origins. Whenever Horst spoke, Bruno caught a sense of the excitement that gripped the scholar.<br><br>&#x201c;Horst,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;How are you? I was just on my way to see you at the dig.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good, we need you here right away. And you had better bring a doctor with you. We&#x2019;ve found a body.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Congratulations. Isn&#x2019;t that what you wanted to find?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, but I want skeletons from the distant past. This one is wearing a St. Christopher medal around his neck and I think he&#x2019;s also wearing a Swatch. This is your department, Bruno, not mine.&#x201d;</p><h2>Discoveries: The Bronze Age in Europe</h2><p>Achilles, Odysseus, and the other heroes of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey fought with shields and swords of bronze. What was the world like in those mythic days, when the rival Greek cities of Troy and Mycenae battled for supremacy, and, far to the west, unknown engineers raised the megaliths of Stonehenge? What do we know of even earlier times, when the settled peoples of Europe first replaced their crude stone tools with those made of refined metal, and crafted ornaments of beaten copper and gold?<br>Archaeologists date the Bronze Age in Europe from about the 5th to the 1st millennium BC. That span of time saw dramatic changes in civilizations from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea, and from Scandinavia to the Aegean. The discovery of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was remarkable technological development, permitting the casting of much stronger tools and weapons. Across Europe, the peoples of the Bronze Age forged metal and traded its products, raised monolithic standing stones, practiced similar funerary and religious rites, and decorated their products with the same motifs and symbols. From Cretan palaces to Swiss lakeside dwellings, a common culture arose. As they explore the epic of the Bronze Age, the archaeologists Jean-Pierre Mohen and Christiane Eluere take us back beyond the borders of history.</p><p></p><h2>Trinity Blood, Vol. 1</h2><p>In a post-apocalyptic world after the destruction brought about by Armageddon, the war between humans and vampires continues, yet, amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species, but standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other.</p><p></p><h2>I Am the Only Running Footman (Richard Jury Mystery)</h2><p>They were two young women, strikingly similar in life...strikingly similar in death.

A few pieces have recently been published elsewhere (including excerpts from Mark Beyer's loopy, design-heavy <i>Amy and Jordan</i> and Joe Sacco's comics essay on Sarajevo, <i>The Fixer</i>), but the book is a superb introduction to the best American cartoonists working today. Some of them, including Richard McGuire and Mark Newgarden, haven't published much since the heyday of <i>RAW</i> in the late 1980s and early '90s; others, like Lynda Barry and Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, are prolific creators at the top of their form. As Ira Glass points out in his introduction, Ware seems to believe cartooning gets no respect at all, and his <i>McSweeney's</i> is a passionate defense of the medium. Ware has included work by artists with an impressively varied range of visual styles and narrative techniques. And Ware's own contribution is brilliant: the book's cover unfolds into a gigantic "comics supplement" of his bitter little cartoons, with extra, tiny comic books by Ron Reg� Jr. and John Porcellino tucked into its folds. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Anyone who heard these diaries excerpted on the PBS-TV series The Civil War will recognize his accounts of those campaigns, which remain outstanding for their clarity and detail. Most of all, Rhodes&#39;s words reveal the motivation of a common Yankee foot soldier, an otherwise ordinary young man who endured the rigors of combat and exhausting marches, short rations, fear, and homesickness for a salary of $13 a month and the satisfaction of giving &#34;all for the union.&#34;"One of the best firsthand accounts I have read of campaigning and combat in the Civil War." -- James M. McPherson, author of Battle Cry of Freedom<p>"One of the most remarkable diaries I have ever read. Elisha Hunt Rhodes saw action from Bull Run to Appomattox and somehow survived, and his diary came to represent, better than any other I found, the spirit of the Union soldier." -- Ken Burns, director and writer of The Civil War</p></p><h2>Death of a Ghost (A Hamish Macbeth Mystery, 32)</h2><p><b>Sergeant Hamish Macbeth--Scotland's most quick-witted but unambitious policeman--returns in M.C.

Still, Hamish decides that he and his policeman, Charlie "Clumsy" Carson, will spend the night at the ruined castle to get to the bottom of the rumors once and for all.There's no sign of any ghost...but then Charlie disappears through the floor. It turns out he's fallen into the cellar. And what Hamish and Charlie find there is worse than a ghost: a dead body propped against the wall. Waiting for help to arrive, Hamish and Charlie leave the castle just for a moment--to eat bacon baps--but when they return, the body is nowhere to be seen. It's clear something strange--and deadly--is going on at the castle, and Hamish must get to the bottom of it before the "ghost" can strike again...</p><p><b>M. C.

She lurches between women, more in love with the idea of love than with Iris or Willa or Gwynne or Petra. Her work experiences are equally brief, although she can't bring herself to actually quit jobs. She just stops showing up. "Are you going to work?" her current lover asks one morning. <blockquote> No, I was not going to work. I was an artist, a lover, a lover of women, of the oppressed and downtrodden, a warrior really. I should have been somewhere leading an armed revolution in the name of love and no, I was not going to work. Willa didn't work. I mean, she did, but it's a stretch to call it work. She bartended at a dyke bar a few nights a week, drank free beer, and bummed all her cigarettes.... All week she was free, writing angsty brilliant poems, drawing comic books, painting gigantic painful pictures, you know, living. I wanted to live. </blockquote> Michelle Tea's characters are a peculiar fin-de-si�cle blend of jaded idealists and thoughtful egotists: sex workers, poets, and mad hatters who end up making breakfast for roomfuls of stoned strangers. The occasional flash of clarity doesn't alter the basically anarchic nature of Tea's meandering narrative, so much like the tales of an incidental figure from <i>Valencia</i>, a loud redhead named Iggy who told stories "so incredible you wondered if they were true but ultimately didn't care because you were so enraptured by her grand gestures and re-enactments." <i>--Regina Marler</i>Tea, a modern-day Beat, is also a kind of pop ambassador to the world of the tattooed, pierced, politicized and sex-radical queer-grrls of San Francisco. Her second novel (after The Passionate Mistakes and Intricate Corruption of One Girl in America) dramatizes the hopes and hurts, apathies and ambitions of young lesbians looking for love in the Mission District, focusing on Michelle, a poet navigating the druggy, boozy dyke scene while consorting with a series of wacky lady loves. Among these are Petra, who thrills Michelle by brandishing a knife and being bossy in bed; Willa, a depressive who won't take off her clothes even in the heat of passion; Iris, originally from Georgia; and Scrumptious, who Michelle falls for before she realizes she's the type of girl who wears corny "freedom rings" and white jeans. While the trivialities of these courtships are entertaining and the book is far more coherent than the author's first novel, Tea hasn't entirely figured out how to make her characters come to life beyond predictable bounds. Organized as a series of loosely linked character profiles, the book self-consciously relies on the hipster grooviness and inside jokes of S.F. culture to energize the narrative. And although Tea's writing is consistently uncommon and textured -- "the mushrooms tasted like a trunk of moth-eaten clothes and after we ate them we went out to the stoop and waited for the world to turn weird"--folks waiting for the truly weird, breakthrough novel in downtown alt-chick literature will be disappointed by this sometimes-superficial, stylized entry.

But so what? Her food (it's her name on the cover of the cookbook, even though any food coming out of a restaurant as popular and free-spirited as the original Fog City Diner in San Francisco is likely to be something of a group effort--kind of like the Manhattan Project) brightened palates back in 1985 when the diner opened, and it serves adventurous palates just as well today.<p> Remember when attaching "California" to food actually meant a thing or two? <i>Fog City Diner Cookbook</i> is something of a time capsule in that regard. You have seen similar-looking food on menus in your town. But that's now, and this book (and the food before it) came out back when it was news. What's interesting to note, however, is that Pawlcyn bases her dishes on sound culinary principles. She isn't throwing oddball ingredients together to grab attention or to appear to be clever, she's combining flavors and textures and cultural heritage to achieve specific effects, with new and powerful results. In other words, she shows restraint on the one hand, and knows what she's doing on the other.</p><p> For that first blush of that brash California "thang" with food, don't hesitate to hang your hat inside the Fog City Diner. The cookbook, that is. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>On the front door of the Fog City Diner in San Francisco is a sign: "No Crybabies." And it means "anything goes--have a good time, and leave your problems elsewhere," writes Bill Higgins, a co-proprietor with Pawlcyn, and contributor of the introduction to this collection of the diner's recipes. Obviously, Fog City has many of the usuals--though they've been spruced up--and, less obviously, it practices the sort of sophistication in food that San Francisco is famous for. So the book serves up mashed potatoes, and duck stew; gingerbread, and sauteed prawns; chili dogs, and lobster gazpacho. This provocative little volume offers a welcome taste of old and new, American and fusion, and a vicarious trip to a metro area that doubles as culinary nirvana. One can nearly understand why people get into the business of serving food (and drink--Fog City is well known for its eclectic stock): pleasure, sheer license.

Each of its 49 chapters explores a specific site or intersection in the city, from the mighty Golden Gate Bridge to the raunchy Tenderloin to the soaring sea cliffs at Land's End.</p><p>This unique approach captures the exhilarating experience of walking through San Francisco's sublime terrain, while at the same time tying that experience to a history as rollicking and unpredictable as the city herself. From her absurd beginnings as the most distant and moth-eaten outpost of the world's most extensive empire, to her instantaneous fame during the Gold Rush, from her apocalyptic destruction by earthquake and fire to her perennial embrace of rebels, dreamers, hedonists and misfits of all stripes, the City by the Bay has always followed a trajectory as wildly independent as the untrammeled natural forces that created her.</p><p>This ambitious, eclectic, and beautifully written book draws on everything from on-the-ground reporting to obscure academic papers to the author's 40-year life in San Francisco to create a rich and insightful portrait of a magical corner of the world. Complete with hand-drawn maps ofthe 49locations, this handsome package will sit comfortably on the short shelf of enduring books about places, alongside E. B. White's <i>Here is New York</i>, Jose Saramago's <i>Journey to Portugal</i>, or Alfred Kazin's <i>A Walker in the City</i>.</p></p><p>Gary Kamiya was born in Oakland in 1953 and grew up in Berkeley.

Providing pastors and Bible students with a comprehensive and scholarly tool for the exposition of the Scriptures and the teaching and proclamation of their message, this twelve-volume reference work has become a staple of seminary and college libraries and pastors&#39; studies worldwide. The seventy-eight contributors come from the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand, and from many denominations, including Anglican, Baptist, Brethren, Methodist, Nazarene, Presbyterian, and Reformed. They represent the best in evangelical scholarship committed to the divine inspiration, complete trustworthiness, and full authority of the Bible. The Expositor&#39;s Bible Commentary uses the New International Version for its English text, but also refers freely to other translations and to the original languages. Each book of the Bible has, in addition to its exposition, an introduction, outline, and bibliography. Notes on textual questions and special problems are correlated with the expository units; transliteration and translation of Semitic and Greek words make the more technical notes accessible to readers unacquainted with the biblical languages. In matters where marked differences of opinion exist, commentators, while stating their own convictions, deal fairly and irenically with opposing views.

The Gypsies have a legendary aversion to &#34;gadje,&#34; or outsiders, but Fonseca has lifted the curtain and written gracefully about their lives on the edge of society.Isabel Fonseca describes the four years she spent with Gypsies from Albania to Poland, listening to their stories, deciphering their taboos, and befriending their matriarchs, activists, and child prostitutes.

In this fascinating collection, Paul B. Janeczko probes examples from clothesline codes to surveillance satellites and cyber espionage. Colorful personalities, daring missions, the feats of the loyal, and the damage of traitors are interspersed with a look at the technological advances that continue to change the rules of gathering intelligence.<br>Back matter includes source notes, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Best known for his award-winning poetry titles, Janeczko has a long-held fascination with the shadowy world of espionage, which he explored in Top Secret: A Handbook of Codes, Ciphers, and Secret Writing (2004). Here he revisits cryptology basics and other intelligence-gathering techniques, but his main focus is on the spies themselves, and in a fascinating series of profiles, he presents notorious spooks, from the Revolutionary War to the cold war, closing with Soviet moles Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen. A final passage briefly covers twenty-first-century developments, such as cyber espionage, but, as Janeczko says, the post-9/11 intelligence world is &#x201c;a subject for another book.&#x201d; A few portraits and reproductions of code charts illustrate, but this title relies mostly on Janeczko&#x2019;s graceful, exciting storytelling to draw kids&#x2019; interest. With well-chosen subjects (including many women and African Americans who used their marginalized positions to gather information) and contagious enthusiasm for the spy world&#x2019;s &#x201c;tantalizing mysteries,&#x201d; this makes a strong choice for both avid and reluctant readers alike, and appended source notes and a bibliography bolster the curricular appeal.

Eckert</b>&nbsp;is an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning scriptwriter and a Newbery Honor author of books for young readers. He is also the author of the popular six-volume historical series&nbsp;<i>Narratives of America</i>&nbsp;and the creator of&nbsp;<i>Tecumseh!</i>, an outdoor drama staged regularly in Chillicothe, Ohio, that has played to more than a million people over the past 20 years.A spirited but misdirected stab at a definitive biography of the great Shawnee warrior, from prolific historian and novelist Eckert, whose six-volume nonfiction The Winning of America series (Twilight of Empire, Gateway to Empire, etc.) paved the way for this epic. Employing what he terms ``narrative biography'' as a touchstone (and as an apparent euphemism for poetic license), Eckert embarks on a quest for the real Tecumseh, seeking a life buried beneath countless legends and tales. The result is a mammoth account of a remarkable American from the spectacular moment of his birth--concurrent with the appearance of a brilliant shooting star- -to his sudden death in the Battle of Thames in 1813, an event described in more than 40 different ways by ``eyewitnesses.'' Along with the portrait of a man of keen insight and ability--a natural leader who eschewed the role of chief but who sought tirelessly to unite all tribes in a pan-Indian movement--emerges a rich tapestry of Native American society in the Ohio region during Tecumseh's time. The Indian leader and his family, especially his brother, the prophet Tenskwatawa, figured dramatically in the growing violence along the frontier as white settlers swarmed across the Appalachians onto Indian lands. By emphasizing the greatness of Tecumseh, however, Eckert minimizes the significance of tribal unification as a wider phenomenon and the role of spiritual leaders in firing that movement, to the extent that, for instance, Tenskwatawa is depicted as a sniveling conniver achieving renown largely through his brother's generosity. A biography that succeeds better as fiction. Astoundingly detailed but ambitious to a fault, in its interpretative zeal it strays from, or at least embellishes, the historical record to the point of being suspect. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The interior doors, though, looked as if they&#x2019;d&nbsp;been smashed down and repaired; two of the panels were bright&nbsp;new wood, devoid of any patina or termite scarring.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Burglars?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Or are you just slack on building&nbsp;maintenance?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Got to look the part,&#x201d; Galdovar said. &#x201c;And we know exactly&nbsp;how a union office should look after the authorities have&nbsp;raided it, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He was one of those who normally did the raiding. She had&nbsp;to concede the point. Sounds of movement behind the repaired&nbsp;door made her check automatically for a way out if this meeting&nbsp;turned out not to be one she&#x2019;d bargained on. The only place she&nbsp;felt safe these days was on a Republic warship, and not just because of Gilad; the entire galaxy was in turmoil. The front line&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t end at planetary boundaries, or sometimes even within&nbsp;families.<br><br>&nbsp;Hallena walked into a small back office filled mainly by a battered&nbsp;table. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the two heavily armed men sitting&nbsp;at one side of it&#x2013;she could spot the outlines of weapons as well&nbsp;as anyone&#x2013;she might even have swallowed the cover story about&nbsp;this place being an administrative office for the Union of Fabricants,&nbsp;Plastoid Molders, and Allied Trades, Local 61.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; she said. Their eyes locked on hers as if they&nbsp;weren&#x2019;t entirely sure she was genuine. &#x201c;Unity is strength, people,&nbsp;power to the workers, and all that. So what have you got for&nbsp;me?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The younger of the two men raised a bleached- blond eyebrow.&nbsp;He didn&#x2019;t offer any introductions. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re getting&nbsp;into character,&#x201d; he said sourly. &#x201c;We think the people you&#x2019;re&nbsp;looking for are these two.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He shoved a holoimage projector across the table, flicking&nbsp;his thumbnail against the controls to activate an image. It was a&nbsp;snatched shot of a man and a woman caught in midstride as they&nbsp;hurried toward a speeder; early thirties, heads covered by factory&nbsp;workers&#x2019; caps, like thousands of other laborers in the city.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Merish Hath and her boyfriend, Shil Kaval,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The&nbsp;usual troublemaking variety of malcontent.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Hallena studied the image. The JanFathal police couldn&#x2019;t&nbsp;just pick them up and make them disappear, like they usually&nbsp;did. The Regent had held absolute power for thirty years; he&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t going to get a hard time from his judges because he&#x2019;d&nbsp;had them all jailed some years ago. But pieces in this particular&nbsp;puzzle were missing.&nbsp;<br><br>It was her job to find them.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like this sorted,&#x201d; said the younger man. The stark&nbsp;contrast of his eyebrows against his ebony skin was hypnotically&nbsp;weird; and he was obviously more senior in the hierarchy than&nbsp;he looked, or else he was just massively arrogant. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t&nbsp;want a few million droids landing in our backyard uninvited.&nbsp;The troublemakers we&#x2019;ve been monitoring have been a lot more&nbsp;active in the last few weeks, like they&#x2019;re preparing for something.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe your Regent should concentrate on building a&nbsp;proper army instead of blowing his budget on internal security.&#x201d;&nbsp;Hallena took the holoimager and transferred the image to her&nbsp;own device. The more she saw of some of the Republic&#x2019;s allies,&nbsp;the less weight she gave their strategic value. &#x201c;So can you get me&nbsp;into their circle, or not? What&#x2019;s my cover identity?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Sister Devis&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me you haven&#x2019;t used that name . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Blond Brows sucked his teeth, clearly annoyed at the interruption.&nbsp;&#x201c;We might be a long way from Coruscant, ma&#x2019;am, but&nbsp;we&#x2019;re not country bumpkins. Your ID says Orla Taman. You&#x2019;re&nbsp;a union convener from Nuth, which is far enough away to explain&nbsp;why you&#x2019;re not one of their little cabal, and you&#x2019;ve been in&nbsp;prison for a few years for your unpatriotic activities. Now&nbsp;you&#x2019;re out and looking to sow dissent and hasten the glorious&nbsp;revolution.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Blond Brows passed her an identichip and a few battered&nbsp;personal possessions of the kind that a newly released prisoner&nbsp;might have: an old- style comlink, a few folded sheets of tattered&nbsp;flimsi that looked like a precious letter hidden and re read for&nbsp;years, and a holozine on the virtues of obedient citizenship of the&nbsp;kind that all those freed were given on release to keep them on&nbsp;the straight and narrow.&nbsp;<br><br>Hallena looked them over carefully. &#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, then we get you into the armaments factory tomorrow&nbsp;morning, and you line up for a job. They take casual labor&nbsp;by the day or week.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have an impressive r�sum�?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fully proficient in removing metal swarf from factory&nbsp;floors. A genius with a broom.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>It certainly beat passing herself off as a brain surgeon. There&nbsp;was no arcane professional knowledge to bluff through when&nbsp;she was pushing a broom. She didn&#x2019;t even have to pretend she&#x2019;d&nbsp;done it before. &#x201c;Very well. I&#x2019;ll head back to my modest hovel&nbsp;and go begging for work tomorrow.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The older man sitting beside Blond Brows spoke for the first&nbsp;time. He looked like a chunk of granite that had been dumped&nbsp;by an avalanche, all square solidity and craggy grayness, the&nbsp;kind of man who would stand firm until time flowed around&nbsp;him.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re caught,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ll kill you and go to&nbsp;ground, and we&#x2019;ll have to start all over again. We might not have&nbsp;the time to do that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>It was the simplest of statements, dazzling in its selfevidence.&nbsp;&#x201c;Sounds like every job I&#x2019;ve ever done.&#x201d; Hallena got up to&nbsp;leave. One hand still rested on her blaster. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in touch&nbsp;when I have something useful for you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Maybe. I&#x2019;ll see how it goes. This is for the Republic.&nbsp;<br><br></i>The granite- and- blondness double act didn&#x2019;t move as she&nbsp;took a step or two backward without turning. For some reason,&nbsp;she felt more wary in this building among nominal allies than&nbsp;outside, surrounded by potential assassins.&nbsp;<br><br><i>If they ever venture out in this wind, of course . . .&nbsp;<br><br></i>Back at her lodgings, a stark and cramped little room above&nbsp;a grocery store, the ubiquitous dust had crept through every gap&nbsp;and left a convenient intruder warning system across every flat&nbsp;surface. Hallena closed the front doors behind her and stood listening&nbsp;for a moment, checking who might be where. When she&nbsp;studied the thin coating of dust, footprints and scuffs had worn&nbsp;a clean path between the side doors to the shop and the owner&#x2019;s&nbsp;living quarters across the passage. The layer on the stairs was&nbsp;still undisturbed, though. Nobody had gone up to her room&nbsp;since she&#x2019;d left.&nbsp;<br><br>She had no real reason to check. It was just habit; careful,&nbsp;wary habit.&nbsp;<br><br>The shop doors parted and the elderly female owner stuck&nbsp;her head through the gap, smiling to reveal more gaps than&nbsp;teeth. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t last much longer, my dear,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Regular as&nbsp;sunset, that wind. It&#x2019;ll die down by this time tomorrow, and then&nbsp;the rains start.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; Hallena lied. It sounded as if the woman&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t think she was local. &#x201c;I used to visit Athar as a kid.&#x201d; <i>Don&#x2019;t&nbsp;push it, don&#x2019;t get a conversation going. </i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get a job&nbsp;tomorrow. I&#x2019;ll be out all day.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a bit secretive, you are.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Stang, is she Force- sensitive or something? </i>That risk had&nbsp;never troubled Hallena before, but the war had suddenly made&nbsp;her aware of how many beings there were who could sense her&nbsp;feelings or even try to shape her thoughts. Spies liked to be the&nbsp;ones who did the shaping and sensing. It was the natural order&nbsp;of espionage.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just been released from prison,&#x201d; Hallena said at last,&nbsp;suitably awkward. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not something I want to brag about.&nbsp;Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2013;it&#x2019;s nothing violent or dishonest.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It never is,&#x201d; the woman said, suddenly serious. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always&nbsp;political these days.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Hallena didn&#x2019;t take it any farther. She retreated to her room,&nbsp;and spent the rest of the day tinkering with her comm kit&#x2013;minimal,&nbsp;concealed within the old comlink, nothing that would&nbsp;make her look too well equipped in this austere world&#x2013;and observing&nbsp;the activity in the street below through a small clear&nbsp;patch in the grimy transparisteel pane. Yes, the wind seemed to&nbsp;be dropping; a few more people were out on the walkways,&nbsp;some wearing goggles, others with their mouths still covered by&nbsp;scarves, but they seemed to know that respite was coming.&nbsp;<br><br><i>How long am I going to be here?&nbsp;<br><br></i>Hallena was glad she&#x2019;d never been a sleeper, living undercover&nbsp;for a lifetime until a controller she&#x2019;d never seen finally&nbsp;called one day and gave her a mission within a society she might&nbsp;have grown to think of as her own. Short bursts of being someone&nbsp;and something else were much more manageable.&nbsp;<br><br><i>I can only live so much of a lie.&nbsp;<br><br></i>Gil Pellaeon knew exactly what she was and accepted her&nbsp;for it. That was a rare source of honest stability in her line of&nbsp;work. She didn&#x2019;t even keep a holoimage of him with her: too&nbsp;risky, like any genuine personal possession that might identify&nbsp;her if she was captured. But Gil understood the nature of their&nbsp;relationship&#x2013;snatched moments, denials, no real prospect of&nbsp;routine, daily, comfortable domestic bliss like other couples&#x2013;&nbsp;because his job wasn&#x2019;t so different.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Will either of us survive long enough to get out, to retire?&nbsp;...</i></p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub Omnibus Volume 1</h2><p>A samurai epic of staggering proportions, the acclaimed Lone Wolf and Cub begins its second life at Dark Horse Manga with new, larger editions of over 700 pages, value priced.

Anselm We Never Know How Things Will Turn Out Ispent the first twenty years of my life feeling certain I knew the will of God for my life. I was going to practice medicine. I was as sure about the future as I was about the difficulty of getting there, for making it to the end seemed a daunting task to me. While still in high school, I talked seriously with a plastic surgeon about joining his practice when I completed my education, and he invited me to his summer home to show me slides of his work. By the time I entered college, I was eager to enroll in science and math courses to prepare for medical school. I had one goal in mind. Everything else was a distraction and inconvenience to me, like having to do chores on a hot summer day. But I made a fatal mistake in selecting a college. Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan, was a liberal arts institution, which meant that it required students to take a broad range of general studies courses. If I ever wanted to earn a degree from Hope, therefore, I would have to do more than study science. I would also have to read Dostoyevsky, listen to Beethoven, study the causes of the Crimean War, and write a persuasive essay. I was about as eager to study the liberal arts as I was to read a dictionary for weekend pleasure. But I had no choice. In my first semester I signed up for a freshman writing class. For years I had read literature only under duress and had avoided writing altogether, except when my teachers forced me to put pen to paper. Fortunately, my writing professor, Dr. Nancy Miller, knew my type. Savvy and sociable, she was adept at handling people like me. When I griped one day about the writing requirement, she ignored me as if I had just made a bland comment about the Detroit Lions. When I told her that I simply did not need the course because I was not planning to write for a career, she replied, &#39;You never know, Jerry, how things will turn out.&#39; She was right, of course. I ended up doing something far different from what I had assumed was God&#39;s will for my life. I did not attend medical school; I enrolled in seminary. I did not become a medical doctor; I became a minister instead. Later I returned to graduate school to earn an advanced degree. Now I serve as a college professor, and I write in my spare time. Words are therefore central to what I do. The writing course I took my freshman year of college became very useful to me, and my writing teacher proved to be a prophet. As it turns out, both course and teacher helped to prepare me for a vocation I never imagined at the time I would be doing. Inability to Predict the Future From this experience, I learned a valuable lesson I will never forget: We never know how things will turn out. What appears in our minds to be the pathway we should take might change as suddenly as weather in the Midwest. So we would be wise to be attentive and responsive to God along the way, even in matters that appear to have little significance, such as crafting good papers in a freshman writing class. Perhaps our attention to these little things is the will of God, and our preoccupation with the future a foolish distraction. As I look back on my forty-nine years, I see a pattern emerge. At various points along the way I thought I knew the pathway I was supposed to take, but I ended up doing something quite different. This different &#39;something&#39; turned out to be the will of God. At twenty, I was sure that God wanted me to pursue a career in medicine; I became a minister instead. At thirty, I was planning to stay the course in pastoral ministry; now I am a college professor. At forty, I didn&#39;t aspire to be an avid writer; now I am finishing this, my fifth book. At every step along the way I thought I knew God&#39;s will for my life. I thought I had it all figured out. But it did not turn out as I had planned. It occurred to me a few years ago that either I had developed the bad habit of missing the will of God for my life, or I had a mistaken notion of what God&#39;s will was and is. The first alternative terrified me, for I had lived far too long and had made too many irreversible decisions---like getting married and having children---to wish I could start over in a vain attempt to get back on track. Besides, I have had too much evidence at my disposal---such as contentment of life and joy in my work---to assume that I had missed the will of God. It struck me as odd that I could wander that far off course without intending to, and yet not know it. So I concluded that I had misunderstood what God&#39;s will really is. Like a detective who had followed leads to one dead end after another, I decided to pursue another course altogether. I began to explore a different way of approaching the will of God. It proved to be one of the most exciting decisions I ever made. Suffering Loss The inability to predict the future was the first clue that set me searching in a different direction. But it was not the only clue I had. A second clue came from suffering loss. My wife Lynda and I had four wonderful children, two girls and two boys. We were deliriously happy. But that happiness---what we assumed was the &#39;will of God&#39; for our lives---came to a sudden halt in the fall of 1991 when a drunk driver jumped his lane and collided with our minivan, killing Lynda, my mother Grace, who was visiting us for the weekend, and my daughter Diana Jane. Four of us survived. John, then only two, was seriously hurt. Catherine (eight), David (seven), and I were injured, though not badly enough to require hospitalization. That experience set me to thinking about the will of God. I had assumed that my marriage to Lynda was the will of God, that our family of six was the will of God, that the happy, stable, prosperous life we enjoyed together was the will of God. We were, as so many said, &#39;the ideal family.&#39; How could God allow such a tragedy to happen?1 I could not believe that God had suddenly changed his mind about what he willed for us---a good marriage and a healthy family. How, then, could my life as a single father of three traumatized children also be the will of God? The accident forced me to reconsider my assumptions about God&#39;s will. Did God plan only &#39;the good life&#39; for me? If so, I wondered how I could integrate suffering into my understanding of God&#39;s will. Or did God plan something very different for me, something still good, but also hard and painful at the same time? If so, I had to face the prospect that my approach to the will of God was entirely mistaken.</p><h2>Perrine&#x2019;s Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense</h2><p>An authoritative, continually updated bestseller for over sixty years, PERRINE&#39;S LITERATURE: STRUCTURE, SOUND, AND SENSE, 13e provides the most effective introduction to literature for a new generation of learners.

With the birth of radio in the 1920s, the songs moved from small towns, mountain hollers, and the wide-open West to become the music of an entire nation--a diverse range of sounds and styles from honky tonk to gospel to bluegrass to rockabilly, leading up through the decades to the music's massive commercial success today.<br><br>But above all, <i>Country Music</i> is the story of the musicians.
